Xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with potent antiviral activity against varicella-zoster virus and human cytomegalovirus,"While noncanonic xanthine nucleotides XMP/dXMP play an important role in balancing and maintaining intracellular purine nucleotide pool as well as in potential mutagenesis, surprisingly, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates bearing a xanthine nucleobase have not been studied so far for their antiviral properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates and evaluation of their activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two acyclic nucleoside phosphonates within the series, namely 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX) and 9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]xanthine (HPMPX), were shown to possess activity against several human herpesviruses. The most potent compound was PMEX, a xanthine analogue of adefovir (PMEA). PMEX exhibited a single digit mM activity against VZV (EC 50 ¼ 2.6 mM, TK þ Oka strain) and HCMV (EC 50 ¼ 8.5 mM, Davis strain), while its hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative was active against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (EC 50 values between 1.8 and 4.0 mM). In contrast to acyclovir, PMEX remained active against the TK -VZV 07-1 strain with EC 50 ¼ 4.58 mM. PMEX was suggested to act as an inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase and represents the first reported xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with potent antiviral properties.","The concentration and ratio of purine nucleotides and deoxynucleotides in the nucleotide pool is highly regulated in order to maintain the proper function and genetic stability of mammalian cells. 1 Imbalances in (deoxy)nucleotide pool may have mutagenic consequences 2 and may lead to various diseases, such as combined immunodeficiency (loss of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) function), 3 hyperuricemia (loss of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) function) 4 or cancer (uncontrollable activity of inosine-5 0 -monophosphate dehydrogenase, IMPDH). 5 Xanthosine monophosphate (XMP, 1, Figure 1 ) is an important intermediate in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and its concentration is essential for the maintenance of guanine nucleotide pool, 6 where XMP serves as a substrate for guanosine monophosphate synthase, 7 that produces guanosine monophosphate (GMP). XMP is formed either from inosine monophosphate (IMP) by IMPDH or via salvage pathway using hypoxanthine or xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. The XMP level is regulated by 5 0 -nucleotidase that hydrolyzes XMP to xanthosine."

Anecdotal reports suggest plasma with high antibody titers towards influenza may be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza.,"Pandemic influenza remains a global health threat. In the setting of an outbreak, there is a need for new countermeasures that can be rapidly implemented. Plasma therapy has been used experimentally for the last 100 years to treat severe infectious diseases beginning with diphtheria in the 1890's, Spanish flu of 1917-1918, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. A meta-analysis of 8 non-randomized studies using convalescent blood products during the 1918 influenza pandemic calculated a case-fatality rate of 16% among 336 treated participants compared to 37% among 1219 controls. [1] A cohort study of 93 participants with severe H1N1 influenza demonstrated lower mortality in the treatment group receiving H1N1 convalescent plasma vs the control group (20·0% vs. 54·8%; P = .01), [2] although mortality in the control group was higher than expected for comparable severity of illness. [3] [4] [5] [6] Despite these encouraging data, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) of immune plasma for severe influenza has ever been conducted. In an effort to more rigorously evaluate the role of immune plasma in the treatment of severe influenza we conducted a RCT in a non-pandemic setting in participants with respiratory compromise due to influenza."
A Strategy To Estimate Unknown Viral Diversity in Mammals,"The majority of emerging zoonoses originate in wildlife, and many are caused by viruses. However, there are no rigorous estimates of total viral diversity (here termed ""virodiversity"") for any wildlife species, despite the utility of this to future surveillance and control of emerging zoonoses. In this case study, we repeatedly sampled a mammalian wildlife host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens (the Indian Flying Fox, Pteropus giganteus) and used PCR with degenerate viral family-level primers to discover and analyze the occurrence patterns of 55 viruses from nine viral families. We then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in P. giganteus to be 58 viruses. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host. We used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families, assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses, with minimal turnover between host species. We estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be~$6.3 billion (or~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity), which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses. IMPORTANCE Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in viral discovery efforts. However, most lack rigorous systematic design, which limits our ability to understand viral diversity and its ecological drivers and reduces their value to public health intervention. Here, we present a new framework for the discovery of novel viruses in wildlife and use it to make the first-ever estimate of the number of viruses that exist in a mammalian host. As pathogens continue to emerge from wildlife, this estimate allows us to put preliminary bounds around the potential size of the total zoonotic pool and facilitates a better understanding of where best to allocate resources for the subsequent discovery of global viral diversity. Lipkin WI. 2013 . A strategy to estimate unknown viral diversity in mammals. mBio 4(5): e00598-13.","A total of 12,793 consensus PCR assays were performed for the detection of viruses from nine different families/ genera, including coronaviruses (CoVs; n ϭ 1,631), paramyxoviruses (PMVs; n ϭ 1,108), hantaviruses (HTVs; n ϭ 1,108), astroviruses (AstVs; n ϭ 1,348), influenza A viruses (IFAVs; n ϭ 1,108), bocaviruses (BoVs; n ϭ 1,739), adenoviruses (AdVs; n ϭ 1,902), herpesviruses (HVs; n ϭ 1,741), and polyomaviruses (PyVs; n ϭ 1,108) ( Table 1) . None of the samples were positive for IFAVs or HTVs, despite previous studies documenting their presence in other bat species (6) (7) (8) ; however, a total of 985 viral sequences representing the other seven viral families were detected in these bats. These sequences were segregated into 55 discrete viruses based on distinct monophyletic clustering (see Materials and Methods) ( Table 1) , and a virus was considered novel if the sequence identity to its closest relative was less than or equal to the identity between the two closest species for a given viral family (9) ."
Pathogenic Influenza Viruses and Coronaviruses Utilize Similar and Contrasting Approaches To Control Interferon-Stimulated Gene Responses,"The broad range and diversity of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) function to induce an antiviral state within the host, impeding viral pathogenesis. While successful respiratory viruses overcome individual ISG effectors, analysis of the global ISG response and subsequent viral antagonism has yet to be examined. Employing models of the human airway, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets were used to compare ISG response patterns following highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI)","stimulation, and overall lethality (4) . Together, the similarities and differences offer an opportunity to identify both conserved and pathogen-specific host responses important during respiratory virus infection."
The Dynamic Nature of the Golgi Complex,The intracellular transport of newly synthe-,"sized G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus is blocked at 200C and this spanning membrane glycoprotein accumulates in the last Golgi compartment, the trans Golgi-network (TGN). Previous morphological evidence suggested that the TGN enlarged significantly under this condition. In the present study we have used stereological procedures to estimate the volume and surface area of the Golgi stack and the TGN of baby hamster kidney cells under different conditions. The results indicate that the increase in the size of the TGN at 20°C is accompanied by a significant decrease in the surface area and volume of the preceding Golgi compartments. A similar effect is also seen in uninfected cells at 20°C, as well as during normal (37°C) infection with Semliki Forest virus. In the latter case, however, the decrease in the size of the Golgi stack and the increase in that of the TGN is not accompanied by inhibition of transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. The results indicate that the Golgi stack and the TGN are dynamic and interrelated structures that are capable of rapid alteration in total surface area in response to changes in the rates of membrane transport."
Nonstructural proteins NS7b and NS8 are likely to be phylogenetically associated with evolution of 2019-nCoV,"The seventh novel human infecting Betacoronavirus that causes pneumonia (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China. The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-nCoV.","In December 2019, the seventh human coronavirus, termed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was found in Wuhan, China. On February 8, 2020, the total number of infections and deaths due to 2019-nCoV globally was 34,439 and 720, respectively, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering."

"First human case of avian influenza A (H5N6) in Yunnan province, China 596484S Case Report","Objective: To report clinical, virological, and epidemiological features of the first death caused by a H5N6 avian influenza virus in Yunnan Province, China. Method: The case was described in clinical expression, chest radiography, blood test and treatment. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect H5N6 virus RNA in clinical and environment samples. Epidemiological investigation was performed including case exposure history determinant, close contacts follow up, and environment sample collection. Results: The patient initially developed sore throat and coughs on 27 January 2015. The disease progressed to severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. And the patient died on 6 February. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N6 virus was isolated from the tracheal aspirate specimen of the patient. The viral genome analyses revealed that the H5 hemmagglutinin gene belongs to 2.3.4.4 clade. Epidemiological investigation showed that the patient had exposure to wild bird. All close contacts of the patient did not present the same disease in seven consecutive days. A high H5 positive rate was detected in environmental samples from local live poultry markets.","Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 hemmagglutinin (HA) combining different neuraminidase (NA) subtype (N1, N2, N5, N6, N8) has been observed in poultries worldwide. 1 Moreover, the H5N6 virus has caused three human infections in mainland China. 2 The first case was a man from Sichuan province in May 2014, followed by another male severe case from Guangzhou province in December 2014. On 8 February 2015, the third human H5N6 infection was reported from Yunnan province. However, detailed descriptions of human infection with H5N6 were absent. We herein summarize the preliminary findings of the H5N6 infection case from Yunnan province."
"Hiroshi OHNO 4) , Kazuhiko SATO 5","Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by infection with BVD virus (BVDV) and can result in economic losses within the livestock industry. In Japan, the test and culling policy is a basic control measure, and implementation of an adequate vaccination program is recommended as a national policy. In addition, optional control measures, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) testing as a mass screening method, are used in several provinces, but their efficacy has not been completely assessed. We evaluated these control measures using the scenario tree model of BVD in Japan, developed in the previous study. The model outputs indicated that compulsory testing of all introduced cattle, rather than only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, was cost effective and reduced the risk of BVDV introduction due to animal movement and that BTM testing could effectively monitor most part of the cattle population. Vaccination coverage and BVDV prevalence among introduced cattle could also affect the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of targeted cattle, particularly under low vaccination coverage or high BVDV prevalence. However, even with the implementation of a highly effective monitoring scheme for many years, BVD risk could not be eliminated; it instead converged at a very low level (0.02%). Disease models with a cost-effective output could be a powerful tool in developing a control scheme for chronic animal diseases, including BVD, with the consent of relevant stakeholders.","Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a chronic disease of cattle globally distributed, caused by infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and results in economic losses to the livestock industry [6, 13-15, 24, 41] . Transient infection (TI) of BVDV in adult ruminants produces subclinical or non-severe symptoms [5, 26] ; however, BVDV can be transmitted to the fetus of pregnant cattle between 30 and 120 days of gestation, thereby inducing fetal immune tolerance to BVDV and resulting in the delivery of persistently infected (PI) calves [23] . PI calves shed BVDVs through oculonasal discharge and other secretions throughout their lives, without showing any apparent clinical manifestations, except fatal mucosal disease [4, 7] . PI cattle are commonly believed to be the primary source of BVDV infection in a herd [15, 27] . Therefore, PI cattle need to be promptly detected and culled for the control of BVD [1] ."
"Lobeglitazone, a Novel Thiazolidinedione, Improves Non- Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Type 2 Diabetes: Its Efficacy and Predictive Factors Related to Responsiveness","Despite the rapidly increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), few treatment modalities are currently available. We investigated the hepatic effects of the novel thiazolidinedione (TZDs), lobeglitazone (Duvie) in T2D patients with NAFLD. We recruited drug-naïve or metformin-treated T2D patients with NAFLD to conduct a multicenter, prospective, open-label, exploratory clinical trial. Transient liver elastography (Fibroscan®; Echosens, Paris, France) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was used to non-invasively quantify hepatic fat contents. Fifty patients with CAP values above 250 dB/m were treated once daily with 0.5 mg lobeglitazone for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was a decline in CAP values, and secondary endpoints included changes in components of glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles. Lobeglitazone-treated patients showed significantly decreased CAP values (313.4 dB/m at baseline vs. 297.8 dB/m at 24 weeks; P = 0.016), regardless of glycemic control. Lobeglitazone improved HbA1C values (7.41% [57.5 mM/M] vs. 6.56% [48.2 mM/M]; P < 0.001), as well as the lipid and liver profiles of the treated patients. Moreover, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline values of CAP, liver stiffness, and liver enzymes, and metformin use. Lobeglitazone treatment reduced intrahepatic fat content, as assessed by transient liver elastography, and improved glycemic, liver, and lipid profiles in T2D patients with NAFLD. Further randomized controlled trials using liver histology as an end point are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of lobeglitazone for NAFLD treatment (Clinical trial No. NCT02285205).","Obesity is a worldwide epidemic that leads to the development of chronic metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) (1) (2) (3) . NAFLD is a condition where fat, mainly triglycerides (TG), accumulates in the hepatocytes of patients who have not consumed excessive amounts of alcohol (4) . Estimates of the prevalence of NAFLD range from 6.3% to 33%, depending on the population (5, 6) , and are expected to rise as obesity rates increase, populations become older, and physical activity levels decrease (4) . Moreover, there is an increased prevalence of NAFLD in T2D patients (7) , and its severity may be aggravated by T2D (8, 9) . However, beyond epidemiology, there are many challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD."
How the Double Spherules of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Impact Our Understanding of RNA Virus Replicative Organelles,"Powered by advances in electron tomography, recent studies have extended our understanding of how viruses construct ""replication factories"" inside infected cells. Their function, however, remains an area of speculation with important implications for human health. It is clear from these studies that whatever their purpose, organelle structure is dynamic (M. Ulasli, M. H. Verheije, C. A. de Haan, and F. Reggiori, Cell. Microbiol. 12:844-861, 2010) and intricate (K. Knoops, M. Kikkert, S. H. Worm, J. C. Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Y. van der Meer, et al., PLOS Biol. 6:e226, 2008). But by concentrating on medically important viruses, these studies have failed to take advantage of the genetic variation inherent in a family of viruses that is as diverse as the archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes combined (C. Lauber, J. J. Goeman, M. del Carmen Parquet, P. T. Nga, E. J. Snijder, et al., PLOS Pathog. 9:e1003500, 2013). In this climate, Maier et al. (H. J. Maier, P. C. Hawes, E. M. Cottam, J. Mantell, P. Verkade, et al., mBio 4:e00801-13, 2013) explored the replicative structures formed by an avian coronavirus that appears to have diverged at an early point in coronavirus evolution and shed light on controversial aspects of viral biology.

As in other positive-stranded viruses, coronavirus replication is thought to take place in dedicated replicative organelles called double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) (1, 2) . However, it was noted from the earliest studies that unlike the organelles of togaviruses and nodaviruses, for example (3), coronavirus DMVs appeared to lack a portal for exporting newly synthesized RNA."
Effect of Olfactory Bulb Ablation on Spread of a Neurotropic Coronavirus into the Mouse Brain,"Previous results suggested that, after intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus, entered the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization . Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion . MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain . Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways.","M ouse hepatitis virus (MHV),' a member of the coronavirus family, causes several diseases in small rodents, including hepatitis, gastroenteritis, and encephalomyelitis (1) .

Transcriptomic Characterization of the Novel Avian-Origin Influenza A (H7N9) Virus: Specific Host Response and Responses Intermediate between Avian (H5N1 and H7N7) and Human (H3N2) Viruses and Implications for Treatment Options,"A novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China in 2013, causing mild to lethal human respiratory infections. H7N9 originated with multiple reassortment events between avian viruses and carries genetic markers of human adaptation. Determining whether H7N9 induces a host response closer to that with human or avian IAV is important in order to better characterize this emerging virus. Here we compared the human lung epithelial cell response to infection with A/Anhui/ 01/13 (H7N9) or highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2 IAV. The transcriptomic response to H7N9 was highly specific to this strain but was more similar to the response to human H3N2 than to that to other avian IAVs. H7N9 and H3N2 both elicited responses related to eicosanoid signaling and chromatin modification, whereas H7N9 specifically induced genes regulating the cell cycle and transcription. Among avian IAVs, the response to H7N9 was closest to that elicited by H5N1 virus. Host responses common to H7N9 and the other avian viruses included the lack of induction of the antigen presentation pathway and reduced proinflammatory cytokine induction compared to that with H3N2. Repression of these responses could have an important impact on the immunogenicity and virulence of H7N9 in humans. Finally, using a genome-based drug repurposing approach, we identified several drugs predicted to regulate the host response to H7N9 that may act as potential antivirals, including several kinase inhibitors, as well as FDA-approved drugs, such as troglitazone and minocycline. Importantly, we validated that minocycline inhibited H7N9 replication in vitro, suggesting that our computational approach holds promise for identifying novel antivirals. IMPORTANCE Whether H7N9 will be the next pandemic influenza virus or will persist and sporadically infect humans from its avian reservoir, similar to H5N1, is not known yet. High-throughput profiling of the host response to infection allows rapid characterization of virus-host interactions and generates many hypotheses that will accelerate understanding and responsiveness to this potential threat. We show that the cellular response to H7N9 virus is closer to that induced by H3N2 than to that induced by H5N1, reflecting the potential of this new virus for adaptation to humans. Importantly, dissecting the host response to H7N9 may guide host-directed antiviral development.","human adaptation, including PB2 E627K and hemagglutinin (HA) Q226L (11, 13) . The consequence of these mutations for the host response has not been assessed. Previous studies of H7N9 virus-host interaction have focused on transmissibility and HA binding properties. The H7N9 strain A/Anhui/01/13 (Anhui01) has a mixed ␣2-3/␣2-6 receptor preference, associated with a capacity to efficiently transmit by direct contact but poorly by respiratory droplets in the ferret model (14) . These properties are intermediary between human seasonal influenza viruses that have an ␣2-6 preference and efficiently transmit by respiratory droplets and H5N1 viruses with an ␣2-3 preference that do not transmit efficiently in either respiratory droplet or direct-contact transmission models (14, 15) . Crystallographic structures of HA from H7N9 strains isolated from human patients show that increased avidity for human receptors compared to that of avian H7 virus is due to the Q226L and G186V mutations (16) . Assays of HA binding to human tissue sections revealed an intermediate binding pattern between human IAV (preferentially binding nonciliated cells of apical regions of the trachea) and H5N1 (binding alveolar sections). In addition, a single mutation, G228S, substantially increased HA binding to human receptors in the human respiratory tract (17) ."
Brief Communication Psychological Responses among Humidifier Disinfectant Disaster Victims and Their Families,"To substantiate psychological symptoms following humidifier disinfectant (HD) disasters, counseling records of 26 victims and 92 family members of victims (45 were bereaved) were analyzed retrospectively. Among the victims, 34.6% had Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores of over 4, which meant they were moderately ill. While anxiety/fear and depression with respiratory symptoms were frequently observed in victims and family members, chronic psychological distress such as alcohol/smoking abuse and insomnia was relatively high in bereaved family members. In conclusion, it is important to provide mental health support for victims and their families, focusing on the characteristic symptoms of each group as well as monetary compensation.","In Korea, several types of chemical disinfectants that had been widely used in humidifiers since 1994 were found to be associated with lung injury, including interstitial pneumonitis and widespread lung fibrosis, 1,2 collectively referred to as humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury (HDLI). In 2011, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korean Ministry of Environment began a program to collect information on individuals with respiratory disease, including lung injury, who presumed their disease to be related to the use of humidifier disinfectants (HDs), in order to determine the veracity of these claims. Approximately 75.6% of Korean children used humidifiers, and 31.1% of children were exposed to HDs. 3 As of March 2018, the number of cases of respiratory damage reported by people who thought their diseases were related to HDs exceeded 6,000. Among these cases, to date, a total of 416 people (179 deaths and 237 survivors) have been judged as having suffered from HDLI. 4 Though there have been various studies on related issues such as the examination of causal relationships between respiratory damage and HD use, 1,5-9 discussion on a national surveillance system to track toxic chemical substances, 10 and the government's legal liability, 11 few studies focusing on psychological responses among victims have been conducted. Considering that several studies related to the sequelae of toxic chemical substance disasters pointed out physical and psychological symptoms such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression among victims, 12-14 it is important to investigate psychological responses in the aftermath of HD disasters."
Electrospray ionisation-cleavable tandem nucleic acid mass tag-peptide nucleic acid conjugates: synthesis and applications to quantitative genomic analysis using electrospray ionisation-MS/MS,"The synthesis and characterization of isotopomer tandem nucleic acid mass tag-peptide nucleic acid (TNT-PNA) conjugates is described along with their use as electrospray ionisation-cleavable (ESI-Cleavable) hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of target DNA sequences by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). ESI-cleavable peptide TNT isotopomers were introduced into PNA oligonucleotide sequences in a total synthesis approach. These conjugates were evaluated as hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of immobilized synthetic target DNAs using ESI-MS/MS. In these experiments, the PNA portion of the conjugate acts as a hybridization probe, whereas the peptide TNT is released in a collision-based process during the ionization of the probe conjugate in the electrospray ion source. The cleaved TNT acts as a uniquely resolvable marker to identify and quantify a unique target DNA sequence. The method should be applicable to a wide variety of assays requiring highly multiplexed, quantitative DNA/RNA analysis, including gene expression monitoring, genetic profiling and the detection of pathogens.","Mass spectrometry has much to offer the field of genomic analysis, particularly in terms of multiplexed analysis and accurate quantification. To date, many mass spectrometry-based approaches for genomic analysis have been based on direct detection of nucleic acids particularly using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-offlight (MALDI TOF) MS analysis. MALDI TOF is well suited to this approach due to the high mass range achievable by TOF analysis, however, MALDI TOF instrumentation is relatively expensive and sample preparation can be quite laborious. In addition, direct analysis of nucleic acids by mass spectrometry suffers from problems such as depurination leading to fragmentation (1) or cation adduct formation (2, 3) . These issues notwithstanding, MALDI TOF analysis of nucleic acids has been applied to DNA sequencing (4, 5) , RNA sequencing (6, 7) , analysis of DNA tandem repeats (8) . In particular, PNA probes, with and without noncleavable mass modifiers, have been used for characterization of genomic DNA libraries (9) , detection of DNA methylation (10) and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (11, 12) by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry."
"Alternative autophagy, brefeldin A and viral trafficking pathways","Two topics that have attracted recent attention in the field of autophagy concern the source of the membrane that is used to form the autophagosome during macroautophagy and the role of noncanonical autophagic pathways. The 2 topics may converge when considering the intersection of autophagy with viral infection. We suggest that noncanonical autophagy, which is sensitive to treatment with brefeldin A, may converge with the infectious cycles of certain DNA and RNA viruses that utilize membrane from the ER and cis-Golgi.","Alternative macroautophagy/autophagy is being reported in an increasing number of papers since it was first described. [1] [2] [3] Two forms of alternative autophagy are called (i) noncanonical BECN1-independent autophagy and (ii) ATG5-and ATG7independent autophagy. In canonical autophagy, autophagosome biogenesis is initiated at the ER-derived omegasome and/ or via a phagophore, although the precise mechanism has not been defined and the source of the membrane donor is the cause of an ongoing debate. Evidence points to the Golgi apparatus as an important membrane source for autophagosome formation. One distinctive feature common to both forms of alternative autophagy, however, is its inhibition by the 16-carbon lactone brefeldin A (BFA), which exerts its disruptive effect at the cis-Golgi, further demarcating a contribution of the Golgi with regard to autophagosome biogenesis; 4, 5 in prior studies, canonical autophagy was not inhibited by BFA treatment. 6, 7 The ATG5-and ATG7-independent but BECN1-dependent autophagy pathway was first documented in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that lack ATG5. 2 Treatment with the stressor etoposide leads to equal numbers of autophagosomes per cell in ATG5 C and ATG5 ¡ MEFs. Furthermore, treatment of both ATG5 C and ATG5 ¡ MEFs with 3-methyladenine suppresses autophagosome formation. However, examination of the autophagosomes in the ATG5 ¡ cells disclosed an absence of LC3-II modification. Furthermore, treatment with BFA inhibits autophagy in the ATG5 ¡ cells but not in the ATG5 C cells. Similar results are obtained in ATG7 ¡ MEFs."
"Citation: Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2012) 1, e56; Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2012) 1, e56","In this study, we investigated lentiviral vector development and transduction efficiencies in well-differentiated primary cultures of pig airway epithelia (PAE) and wild-type pigs in vivo. We noted gene transfer efficiencies similar to that observed for human airway epithelia (HAE). Interestingly, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based vectors transduced immortalized pig cells as well as pig primary cells more efficiently than HIV-1-based vectors. PAE express TRIM5α, a well-characterized species-specific lentiviral restriction factor. We contrasted the restrictive properties of porcine TRIM5α against FIV-and HIV-based vectors using gain and loss of function approaches. We observed no effect on HIV-1 or FIV conferred transgene expression in response to porcine TRIM5α overexpression or knockdown. To evaluate the ability of GP64-FIV to transduce porcine airways in vivo, we delivered vector expressing mCherry to the tracheal lobe of the lung and the ethmoid sinus of 4-week-old pigs. One week later, epithelial cells expressing mCherry were readily detected. Our findings indicate that pseudotyped FIV vectors confer similar tropisms in porcine epithelia as observed in human HAE and provide further support for the selection of GP64 as an appropriate envelope pseudotype for future preclinical gene therapy studies in the porcine model of cystic fibrosis (CF).","Mice with null CFTR mutations [1] [2] [3] [4] or specific disease-associated CFTR mutations [5] [6] [7] have provided many insights into cystic fibrosis (CF) disease; however, they do not recapitulate several aspects of the lung disease pathogenesis. The recent development of alternative CF animal models 8-10 provides a new resource for preclinical therapeutic studies. Importantly, the CF pig exhibits many similarities to CF in humans including multiorgan system involvement (sinus, lung, pancreas, intestine, liver) and the presence of an airway mucosal host defense defect at birth. 9, 11 The cell types comprising the conducting airway epithelium in pigs and humans are similar, and notably lack the ~50% bronchiolar exocrine cells typical of mice. The pig bronchial epithelium is pseudostratified and contains ciliated, basal, and goblet cells, and abundant submucosal glands (reviewed in ref. 12) . Importantly, the distribution of submucosal glands in the conducting airways and the CFTR-dependent and -independent secretion of liquid and macromolecules is similar to human submucosal glands. [13] [14] [15] [16] Thus, pig airway cell composition is much more akin to human airways than are those of mice."
"Engineering a Replication-Competent, Propagation-Defective Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus as a Vaccine Candidate","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus infecting humans that is associated with acute pneumonia, occasional renal failure, and a high mortality rate and is considered a threat to public health. The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-⌬E) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-⌬E genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells.","likely have not required hospital assistance. In fact, recent data suggest that mild respiratory illness might also be part of the clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection (3) . In addition to mild or acute respiratory illness, other reported clinical symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea, fever, and in some cases, renal failure (9) . Many hospitalized cases occurred in persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or immunosuppression (3, 13) . The virus loads are highest in lower respiratory tract samples, although low concentrations of viral RNA can also be found in stool, urine, and blood samples (12) ."
Use of Obstetric Practice Web Sites to Distribute Zika Virus Information to Pregnant Women During a Zika Virus Outbreak,"Objective: To describe the current use of obstetric practice Web sites to disseminate Zika virus information to patients. Design: Review of 913 randomly selected practice Web sites and associated social media accounts in January and August 2016. Setting: Obstetric practice Web sites and associated social media accounts, United States of America. Participants: N/A. Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of obstetric practice Web sites and linked social media accounts providing Zika virus information.","D issemination of health-related information to at-risk populations during an emergency is an important role of public health organizations and a central tenet in any public health response. 1 The importance of accurate, readily available health information has been highlighted as a necessity during prior public health emergencies such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003), H1N1 (2009), and Ebola virus (2014) outbreaks. [2] [3] [4] The Zika virus emergency is another example of a situation where the public is actively seeking information on a public health threat. Public health professionals at all levels have attempted to respond to this demand with a wide array of Internet-based tools and information portals. [5] [6] [7] [8] During a public health emergency, the Internet offers convenient access to unparalleled quantities of information, making it an attractive tool for finding the answer to a specific health question. Despite its popularity, one of the most glaring critiques of the Internet as a health resource is the inability of a consumer to verify the accuracy of much of the information. [9] [10] [11] This particular weakness may be more pronounced in a situation where the scientific knowledge base is rapidly evolving, such as in the case with the Zika virus epidemic. Public health recommendations are often made on the basis of emerging data and are frequently subject to change as remaining knowledge gaps are filled. When faced with such rapidly changing circumstances, patients often look to their health care provider to verify the accuracy of the information and personalize it to their particular situation. 12, 13 However, time constraints placed on clinical encounters and long periods of time between visits often result in providers lacking the ability to adequately answer all of the questions their patients may have. Furthermore, providers may be unaware of or unable to direct patients to a single resource that answers all their questions."
Mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus- Induced Acute Lung Injury,"Systems biology offers considerable promise in uncovering novel pathways by which viruses and other microbial pathogens interact with host signaling and expression networks to mediate disease severity. In this study, we have developed an unbiased modeling approach to identify new pathways and network connections mediating acute lung injury, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen. We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes. This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection. With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice. We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity. The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar damage and acute lung injury, following infection with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV.","revealed the presence of exudative-phase DAD along with increased numbers of macrophages in the lung (1, 6) . Many patients also had lung hemorrhage, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and/or hyaline membrane formation in the alveolar spaces. Patients with longer-term disease (Ͼ10 days postinfection [dpi]) manifested with proliferative-or organizing-phase DAD that encompassed 25% to 100% of the lung (8) . They also had signs of lung fibrosis in both alveolar and interstitial spaces. SARS survivors continue to show lingering effects of their illness with complications including reduced lung elasticity and function (9) ."
The ATF6 branch of unfolded protein response and apoptosis are activated to promote African swine fever virus infection,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection induces apoptosis in the infected cell; however, the consequences of this activation on virus replication have not been defined. In order to identify the role of apoptosis in ASFV infection, we analyzed caspase induction during the infection and the impact of caspase inhibition on viral production. Caspases 3, 9 and 12 were activated from 16 h post-infection, but not caspase 8. Indeed, caspase 3 activation during the early stages of the infection appeared to be crucial for efficient virus exit. In addition, the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell. ASFV uses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a site of replication and this process can trigger ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the host cell. In addition to caspase 12 activation, indicators of ER stress include the upregulation of the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin upon virus infection. Moreover, ASFV induces transcription factor 6 signaling pathway of the UPR, but not the protein kinase-like ER kinase or the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 pathways. Thus, the capacity of ASFV to regulate the UPR may prevent early apoptosis and ensure viral replication.","African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a double-stranded large DNA virus that induces an acute disease of swine in which apoptosis has a central role in pathogenesis. Virus infection elicits apoptosis in target and immune defense cells. 1 The large repertoire of anti-apoptotic proteins encoded by the virus reflects the relevance of apoptosis in limiting viral replication in host cells. Many DNA viruses encode structural and functional homologs of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, named viral Bcl2, including the A179L gene of ASFV. 2 In common with other viruses, ASFV has several strategies to block apoptotic pathways in order to complete virus replication. ASFV encodes proteins involved in apoptosis inhibition, thereby delaying the final execution step of the apoptotic pathway, which occurs only at late post-infection times. Programmed cell death itself may be relevant for the final release of virus particles within apoptotic bodies, which would provide this virus with a mechanism to spread, thus evading the immune system. The central component of the apoptotic machinery is the caspase proteolytic system. There are two groups of caspases: upstream initiator caspases, such as caspases 8 and 9, which cleave and activate other caspases; and downstream effector caspases, including caspase 3, which cleave a variety of cellular substrates, thereby disassembling cellular structures or inactivating enzymes. 3 Caspase 12 is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and it cleaves to an active form in response to ER stress. 4 The ER stress response, also called the unfolded protein response (UPR), is mediated by three transmembrane proteins: (i) the protein kinase-like ER resident kinase (PERK); (ii) the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6); and (iii) the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). 5 These three proteins are associated with the ER chaperone BiP/Grp78, which prevents their aggregation and further activation. However, when misfolded proteins accumulate, BiP is released, thus allowing UPR activation. Activated PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), thus resulting in translation attenuation to counterbalance enhanced protein accumulation. This counterbalancing effect includes the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic mRNA CHOP (c/EBP homologous protein) and mRNA encoding GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein-34), whose association with the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) leads to the dephosphorylation of eIF2a. 5 Activated IRE1 removes 26 nucleotides from X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) mRNA, thereby altering the open reading frame and causing the translation of an active transcription factor. 6 The spliced form of XBP1 protein (sXBP1) is involved in the transcriptional activation of a number of genes, including the ER mannosidase-like protein EDEM, which participates in protein degradation. Finally, activated ATF6 exits ER compartment to migrate to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by proteases. 7 ATF6 cytosolic fragment is a transcription factor responsible for the transcriptional induction of XBP1 as well as many ER chaperone-encoding genes. 5 However, when cells are unable to recover from ER stress, apoptosis occurs."
The gene of an archaeal a-L-fucosidase is expressed by translational frameshifting,"The standard rules of genetic translational decoding are altered in specific genes by different events that are globally termed recoding. In Archaea recoding has been unequivocally determined so far only for termination codon readthrough events. We study here the mechanism of expression of a gene encoding for a a-L-fucosidase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (fucA1), which is split in two open reading frames separated by a À1 frameshifting. The expression in Escherichia coli of the wild-type split gene led to the production by frameshifting of full-length polypeptides with an efficiency of 5%. Mutations in the regulatory site where the shift takes place demonstrate that the expression in vivo occurs in a programmed way. Further, we identify a full-length product of fucA1 in S.solfataricus extracts, which translate this gene in vitro by following programmed À1 frameshifting. This is the first experimental demonstration that this kind of recoding is present in Archaea.","Translation is optimally accurate and the correspondence between the nucleotide and the protein sequences are often considered as an immutable dogma. However, the genetic code is not quite universal: in certain organelles and in a small number of organisms the meaning of different codons has been reassigned and all the mRNAs are decoded accordingly. More surprisingly, the standard rules of genetic decoding are altered in specific genes by different events that are globally termed recoding (1) . In all cases, translational recoding occurs in competition with normal decoding, with a proportion of the ribosomes not obeying to the 'universal' rules. Translational recoding has been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It has crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression and includes stop codon readthrough, ribosome hopping and ±1 programmed frameshifting [for reviews see (2) (3) (4) ]."

Brief Communication Correlation between Pneumonia Severity and Pulmonary Complications in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"This nationwide, prospective cohort study evaluated pulmonary function and radiological sequelae according to infection severity in 73 survivors from the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. Patients with severe pneumonia in MERS-coronavirus infection had more impaired pulmonary function than those with no or mild pneumonia at the 1-year follow-up, which was compatible with the radiological sequelae. Severe pneumonia significantly impairs pulmonary function and makes long radiological sequelae in MERS.","The pulmonary function test, a standardized 6-minute walk test, and chest computed tomography (CT) were performed 1 year after MERS-CoV infection. The pulmonary function tests included total lung capacity (TLC), forced volume vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). All pulmonary function values were presented as predicted percentage considering age, sex, height, body weight, and race. Radiological sequelae were scored as the number of involved lung segments (total score = 19) on chest CT that were suspected to be post-inflammation sequelae, including sub-segmental atelectasis, ground glass opacity, and consolidation by a radiologist. 10 Emphysema, sequelae of tuberculosis, and bronchiectasis were excluded. Severe pneumonia was defined as the patient requiring oxygen therapy, mild pneumonia was defined as the patient presenting with infiltration on chest X-ray but not requiring oxygen therapy, and no pneumonia was defined as the patient without radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 11 Linear regression or linear by linear association was used to evaluate the association between the severity of pneumonia and continuous or categorical variables, as appropriate. The correlation between pneumonia severity and pulmonary function or radiological sequelae was evaluated using a multivariable linear regression model including age, sex, underlying lung diseases, and smoking. P < 0.05 was considered significant. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses."
Performance Evaluation of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) Real-Time PCR Kit for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus RNA,"Background: Molecular detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR assays is the method of choice for diagnosis of MERS. We evaluated the performance of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) real-time PCR Kit (PowerChek MERS assay; Kogene Biotech, Korea) a one-step rRT-PCR assay for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV.","For effective control of potential outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostic tests are needed. Nucleic acid amplification assays are the method most widely used to provide laboratory confirmation of MERS [1] . MERS cases are routinely confirmed based on the detection of unique MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA sequences by real-time reverse-transcription (rRT)-PCR, with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary [2] . The WHO recently published updated interim recommendations for MERS-CoV laboratory testing and recommends an rRT-PCR assay targeting the envelope (upE) gene for screening, followed by confirmation with an assay for the re-gions encoding either the open reading frame (ORF)1a, ORF1b, or the nucleocapsid protein (N). For sequencing, two target sites on the MERS-CoV genome, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes, are suggested [2] [3] [4] ."
"Age-related prevalence of common upper respiratory pathogens, based on the application of the FilmArray Respiratory panel in a tertiary hospital in Greece","The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) is an FDA certified multiplex PCR that can detect 17 viruses and 3 bacteria responsible for upper respiratory tract infections, thus it is potentially useful to the assessment of the age-related prevalence of these pathogens.","Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) can be a serious burden to the healthcare system. [1] The majority of URIs are of viral etiology, but definitive diagnosis can be difficult due to the overlapping clinical presentations of viral and bacterial infections, and the variable sensitivity, and lengthy turn-around time of viral culture. [1] The rapid and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses is essential for the early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antiviral therapy, as well as for the effective implementation of infection control measures. [2] The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) assay is a fully automated, multiplex PCR system, which integrates nucleic acid extraction, nested amplification and detection in a reaction pouch preloaded with all reagents required for detection of 17 viruses and 3 bacteria. [3] It does not require advanced equipment or expertise in molecular diagnostics, making it a useful point-ofcare test for acute respiratory infections, [3] and a valuable tool for the assessment of the age-related prevalence of the responsible pathogens."
An Insect Nidovirus Emerging from a Primary Tropical Rainforest,"Tropical rainforests show the highest level of terrestrial biodiversity and may be an important contributor to microbial diversity. Exploitation of these ecosystems may foster the emergence of novel pathogens. We report the discovery of the first insect-associated nidovirus, tentatively named Cavally virus (CAVV). CAVV was found with a prevalence of 9.3% during a survey of mosquito-associated viruses along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in Côte d'Ivoire. Analysis of habitat-specific virus diversity and ancestral state reconstruction demonstrated an origin of CAVV in a pristine rainforest with subsequent spread into agriculture and human settlements. Virus extension from the forest was associated with a decrease in virus diversity (P < 0.01) and an increase in virus prevalence (P < 0.00001). CAVV is an enveloped virus with large surface projections. The RNA genome comprises 20,108 nucleotides with seven major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and -1b encode two large proteins that share essential features with phylogenetically higher representatives of the order Nidovirales, including the families Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, but also with families in a basal phylogenetic relationship, including the families Roniviridae and Arteriviridae. Genetic markers uniquely conserved in nidoviruses, such as an endoribonuclease-and helicase-associated zinc-binding domain, are conserved in CAVV. ORF2a and -2b are predicted to code for structural proteins S and N, respectively, while ORF3a and -3b encode proteins with membrane-spanning regions. CAVV produces three subgenomic mRNAs with 5= leader sequences (of different lengths) derived from the 5= end of the genome. This novel cluster of mosquito-associated nidoviruses is likely to represent a novel family within the order Nidovirales. IMPORTANCE Knowledge of microbial diversity in tropical rainforests is sparse, and factors driving the emergence of novel pathogens are poorly understood. We discovered and mapped the spread and genetic evolution of a novel mosquito nidovirus from a pristine rainforest to human settlements. Notably, virus diversity decreased and prevalence increased during the process of spreading into disturbed habitats. The novel virus, tentatively termed Cavally virus, contains genetic features common to members of the order Nidovirales (families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae), including conservation of the replicase machinery and expression of subgenomic RNA messages, has a basal phylogenetic relationship to the family Coronaviridae, and clearly differs from the established nidovirus families. Inclusion of this putative novel family in the nidovirus phylogeny suggests that nidoviruses may have evolved from arthropods.","diversity (1) (2) (3) . Microbes are dependent on their hosts, and hot spots of host biodiversity may also be rich in pathogen diversity. Intensive land use changes in West African rainforests began in the 1960s by industrial deforestation, leaving only remnants of the equatorial forest belt (4) (5) (6) . Patches of forest are typically surrounded by agricultural land and human settlements. Logging is linked to a profound decline in biodiversity (4, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Declines in biodiversity are associated with an increased risk of infectious disease emergence in humans and domestic animals (reviewed in reference 13) . Nevertheless, links between anthropogenic habitat modification and virus emergence remain to be confirmed (13, 14) ."
"Clathrin-dependent Localization of txl,3 Mannosyltransferase to the Golgi Complex of Saccharomyces cer isiae","Posttranslational modification of yeast glycoproteins with od,3-1inked mannose is initiated within a Golgi compartment analogous to the medial Golgi cisternae of higher eukaryotes. We have characterized the synthesis, posttranslational modification, and localization of the yeast od,3 mannosyltransferase (Mnnlp) using antibodies prepared against a segment of this protein expressed in bacteria. Mnnlp is initially synthesized as a 98.5-kD, type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is modified with both N-and O-linked oligosaccharides. It is subject to a slow, incremental increase in molecular mass that is dependent upon protein transport to the Golgi complex. Self-modification of Mnnlp with od,3 mannose epitopes, primarily on O-linked oligosaccharides, is at least partly responsible for the incremental increase in molecular mass.","Mnnlp is a resident protein of the Golgi complex and colocalizes with guanosine diphosphatase to at least two physically distinct Golgi compartments by sucrose gradient fractionation, one of which may be a late Golgi compartment that also contains the Kex2 endopeptidase. Surprisingly, we found that a significant fraction of Mnnlp is mislocalized to the plasma membrane in a clathrin heavy chain temperature sensitive mutant while guanosine diphosphatase remains intracellular. A mutant Mnnlp that lacks the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail is properly localized to the Golgi complex, indicating that clathrin does not mediate Mnnlp Golgi retention by a direct interaction with the Mnnlp cytoplasmic tail. These results indicate that clathrin plays a broader role in the localization of Golgi proteins than anticipated."
Analysis on the Pathogenesis of Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism with Human Genomics,"In the present study, the whole human genome oligo microarray was employed to investigate the gene expression profile in symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated. Genomic results may provide a new clue for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of VTE.","Thrombus which may result in pulmonary embolism (PE) mostly comes from deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Altogether, both PE and DVT are named venous thromboembolism (VTE). Because of the high incidence of misdiagnosis, morbidity and mortality, VTE has become one of the essential medical problems around world (1, 2) . After 1990's, clinical report of incidence of PE are sharply increased yearly in China (3) . After 1990's, clinical reports of PE are sharply increased yearly in China (3) . In other Asia Ivyspring International Publisher regions, such as Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, the number of reported PE cases is also increasing (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . There are nearly 900,000 new PE cases in USA every year (9) , 78,000 new cases in Canada, 100,000-200,000 cases in Europe including France, Italy, Spain, Britain, Germany, and 47,000 cases in Australia every year (10). According to the statistical data, provided by an epidemiological surveillance in US, PE is the third leading cause of death (11, 12) , only lags behind malignancy and myocardial infarction."

Viral Pneumonia Requiring Differentiation from Acute and Progressive Diffuse Interstitial Lung Diseases,"Objective The clinical characteristics and chest imaging findings of viral pneumonia and several interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) overlap, and viral pneumonia may be underrecognized and misdiagnosed as certain ILDs. To clarify the frequency of viral pneumonia among patients with acute progressive clinical courses that required a differential diagnosis between ILDs and pneumonia, and to determine the most frequent ILDs misdiagnosed in cases of viral pneumonia.","Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Its diagnosis and treatment have traditionally focused on bacterial pathogens.

"SOX2 knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of basal cell carcinoma cells by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway Key words: sex determining region Y-box 2, basal cell carcinoma, migration, invasion, serine-arginine protein kinase 1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B","Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of human skin cancer, which is driven by the aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling. Previous evidence indicated that sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is associated with the tumor metastasis. However, the expression and role of SOX2 in BCC remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of the most common types of human skin cancer, which is characterized by mutations in the patched and/or smoothened genes, and aberrant expression of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (1) . Epidemiological studies have reported that BCC is associated with exposure to radiation in various populations, including atomic bomb survivors, radiologists and interventional cardiologists (2, 3) . Currently, exposure to UV rays is the most common cause of BCC onset in the general population, and numerous possible mechanisms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of BC, such as DNA damage and certain cell signaling pathways (4) (5) (6) . However, various regulatory factors involved in the chronological progression of BCC lesions also require further investigation."
Developing a vaccine for human rhinoviruses,"Rhinoviruses (RV's) are common human pathogens of the respiratory tract being the most frequent cause of mild diseases of the upper respiratory tract (common cold) but more importantly they are a major initiator of acute exacerbations of chronic airway diseases. Infections can be life threatening in the latter context however RV -induced common colds have an associated economic cost from loss of productivity due to absence from work or school. There are no appropriate antiviral therapies available and vaccine strategies have failed because of the large number of viral serotypes and the lack of cross-serotype protection generated. Here, approaches past and present for development of a vaccine to these widespread human pathogens are highlighted.","Rhinoviruses (RVs) are a species of human pathogens belonging to the genus enterovirus of the picornaviridae family of viruses [1] . RVs are very small viruses about 30nm in diameter that contain a positive sense ssRNA genome of approximately 7500bp that is surrounded by a protein capsid which is composed of 60 copies of four protein subunits that assemble an icosahedron. These structural proteins consist of the externally facing virus protein 1 (VP1), VP2 and VP3 and internal VP4 which lies at the interface of the capsid and RNA genome [2] . RVs infect and cause disease in all humans but most significantly in those individuals with underlying lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where they are a major precipitant of acute exacerbations [3] . The success of RV's as human pathogens is due not only to their speed of infection and onward transmission but also to their ability to adapt and change, resulting in the existence of numerous antigenically distinct serotypes. The original definition and numbering of serotypes from 1 to 100 was based on antibody neutralisation properties with polyclonal antisera where little or no cross- This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. serotype neutralization was observed [4] . Antibodies are directed against the outer surface of the RV capsid most commonly to exposed areas of VP1, VP2 and VP3 [5, 6] . Regions of the capsid sequences display a high degree of heterogeneity amongst serotypes where there are areas with less than 70% homology within the RV polyproteins ( Figure 1) [7] . These result in variable surface-exposed immunodominant epitopes that can dictate serotypespecific immune responses. Based on RNA genome sequence analyses, RV's have now been divided into three groups known as RV types A, B and C [8] and may be further classified by entry receptor usage. Approximately 90% of characterized RV strains (major group) use intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as receptors to enter host epithelial cells [9] whereas the minor group exploits members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family [10] . The entry receptor for group C RV's has yet to be identified due to propagation difficulties in vitro [11] making it difficult to compare serological responses and to therefore pinpoint the exact number of RV serotypes. However, based upon the newer molecular methods to genetically assign RV groupings there is likely to be significantly more than the fully characterized 100 distinct serotypes [12] . When the numbers of distinct RV infections are characterized molecularly by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region, it has been estimated that 47% of infections are due to group A, 12% to group B and 39% to group C [13] . These numbers suggest that upwards of 160 RV serotypes exist and are in circulation. The fact that adults experience on average of 2-5 infections and children up to 10 infections per year [14] , when coupled with the lack of cross protective immunity between serotypes [15] , ensures that humans can expect a lifetime of RV infections. A broadly cross protective vaccine could alleviate many of these infections and the associated health and economic issues, particularly in those with underlying chronic airways diseases."
"Ebola viral disease in West Africa: a threat to global health, economy and political stability","The West African sub-continent is currently experiencing its first, and ironically, the largest and longest Ebola viral diseases (EVD) outbreak ever documented in modern medical history. The current outbreak is significant in several ways, including longevity, magnitude of morbidity and mortality, occurrence outside the traditional niches, rapid spread and potential of becoming a global health tragedy. The authors provided explicit insights into the current and historical background, drivers of the epidemic, societal impacts, status of vaccines and drugs development and proffered recommendations to halt and prevent future occurrences. The authors reviewed mainly five databases and a hand search of key relevant literature. We reviewed 51 articles that were relevant up until the 18 th of August 2014. The authors supplemented the search with reference list of relevant articles and grey literature as well as relevant Internet websites. Article searches were limited to those published either in English or French. There are strong indications that the EVD may have been triggered by increased human activities and encroachment into the forest ecosystem spurred by increasing population and povertydriven forest-dependent local economy. Containment efforts are being hampered by weak and fragile health systems, including public health surveillance and weak governance, certain socio-anthropological factors, fast travels (improved transport systems) and globalization. The societal impacts of the EBV outbreak are grave, including economic shutdown, weakening of socio-political systems, psychological distress, and unprecedented consumption of scarce health resources. The research and development (R&D) pipeline for product against EBV seems grossly insufficient. The outbreak of Ebola and the seeming difficulty to contain the epidemic is simply a reflection of the weak health system, poor surveillance and emergency preparedness/ response, poverty and disconnect between the government and the people in many West African countries. Although interventions by the United Nations and other international development agencies could ultimately halt the epidemic, local communities must be engaged to build trust and create demand for the public health interventions being implemented in the Ebola-ravaged populations. In the intermediate and long term, post-Ebola rehabilitation should focus on strengthening of health systems, improving awareness about zoonosis and health behaviors, alleviating poverty and mitigating the impact of triggering factors. Finally, national governments and international development partners should mobilize huge resources and investments to spur or facilitate R&D of disease control tools for emerging and pernicious infectious diseases (not limited to EVD).","Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the most dreaded infectious diseases known to mankind in the 21 st century. Its high mortality rate, which ranges from 25 and 90% has made the disease one of the most challenging public health issues in recent years. 1 The disease was first described in 1976 in Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), following an outbreak of a previously unknown acute viral hemorrhagic fever. 2 Since then, deadly outbreaks have been reported in Congo, DRC, Gabon, Sudan and Uganda, with a median of 3 outbreaks (range 3-7) per country. 3 In 2014, the largest and deadliest EVD outbreak in history was recorded in West Africa, representing the first occurrence of the disease outside its traditional niche in Central Africa. Unlike previous outbreaks that were easily contained, this current outbreak is quite significant in several ways, including its longevity, rapid spread, unprecedentedly high mortality and morbidity, and the real potential to become globalized in this fast-paced-highly-inter-connected-world. 4 In view of the aforementioned threats or considerations, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared the disease as an International Public Health Emergency and warned that EVD caseload in the crises countries could exceed 20,000 by November 2014. 5 Another expert agency, United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), has forecasted that the caseload in Liberia and Sierra Leone could reach 0.55-1.4 million by January 2015, if additional interventions are not deployed or if cultural practices that do not promote good health continue to persist. 6 In addition, there are concerns that the disease may evolve and linger in several African countries (Figure 1 ), 6 a situation that will place about 22 million individuals at risk of the dis-ease. 7 This is a concern partly because the health systems of these nations are extremely weak (Table 1) [8] [9] [10] [11] and so, they may not be able to effectively handle an EVD outbreak."
NOTE Development of a fluorescent loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid and simple diagnosis of bovine leukemia virus infection,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a condition that threatens the sustainability of the livestock industry. A fluorescent loop-mediated isothermal amplification (fLAMP) assay targeting BLV env sequences was developed and used to evaluate 100 bovine blood samples. Compared with a conventional real-time PCR (rPCR) assay, the fLAMP assay achieved 87.3% (62/71) sensitivity and 100% (29/29) specificity. The rPCR assay took 65 min, while the fLAMP assay took 8 min to 30 min from the beginning of DNA amplification to final judgement with a comparable limit of detection. The fLAMP is a potential tool for the rapid and simple diagnosis of BLV infection to supplement ELISA testing and can be used by local laboratories and slaughterhouses without special equipment.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms.19-0009 [5, 14] . Fluorescent (fLAMP) reagents are commercially available, and this real-time amplification approach allows extremely rapid and accurate diagnosis through the use of an improved chain replacement enzyme and annealing analysis compared with tLAMP [4, 6, 17] ."
A Downward Trend of the Ratio of Influenza RNA Copy Number to Infectious Viral Titer in Hospitalized Influenza A-Infected Patients,"Background. Efficacy endpoints in influenza clinical trials may include clinical symptoms and virological measurements, although virology cannot serve as the primary endpoint. We investigated the relationship between influenza A RNA copy number and quantity of infectious viruses in hospitalized influenza patients.","Although influenza frequently results in a self-limited respiratory illness, in most cases it can cause severe complications leading to hospitalization and death, especially in high-risk groups including elderly patients, immunocompromised persons, pregnant women, very young children, and persons with underlying medical conditions [1] . Worldwide, the annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in approximately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 250 000 to 500 000 deaths [2] . Among hospitalized patients, antiviral therapy is most efficacious if started within 48 hours of influenza illness onset [1, [3] [4] [5] . Nonetheless, some studies have demonstrated that antiviral treatment is still beneficial in hospitalized patients when started 4 and 5 days after illness onset [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Current available antiviral treatments include the neuraminidase inhibitors ([NAIs] inhaled zanamivir, oral oseltamivir, and intravenous peramivir) and M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine). However, all currently circulating strains of influenza are adamantane-resistant, and therefore this class is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of influenza [13] . The NAI peramivir is given intravenously, and so it offers potential advantages in the management of severe hospitalized influenza. Indeed, NAI peramivir was used to treat critically ill patients during the 2009 pandemic under emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [14, 15] and, it received FDA approval to treat acute uncomplicated influenza patients [16] [17] [18] ."
"Clinical Epidemiology Dovepress Pilot study of participant-collected nasal swabs for acute respiratory infections in a low-income, urban population","Objective: To assess the feasibility and validity of unsupervised participant-collected nasal swabs to detect respiratory pathogens in a low-income, urban minority population. Methods: This project was conducted as part of an ongoing community-based surveillance study in New York City to identify viral etiologies of acute respiratory infection. In January 2014, following sample collection by trained research assistants, participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households subsequently collected and returned a self-collected/ parent-collected nasal swab via mail. Self/parental swabs corresponding with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction primary research samples were analyzed. Results: Nearly all (96.8%, n=30/31) households agreed to participate; 100% reported returning the sample and 29 were received (median time: 8 days). Most (18; 62.1%) of the primary research samples were positive. For eight influenza-positive research samples, seven (87.5%) self-swabs were also positive. For ten other respiratory pathogen-positive research samples, eight (80.0%) self-swabs were positive. Sensitivity of self-swabs for any respiratory pathogen was 83.3% and 87.5% for influenza, and specificity for both was 100%. There was no relationship between level of education and concordance of results between positive research samples and their matching participant swab. Conclusion: In this pilot study, self-swabbing was feasible and valid in a low-income, urban minority population.","Community-based studies are an important component of surveillance for acute respiratory infections/influenza-like illness (ARI/ILI). Using nasal self-swabbing to obtain samples for laboratory analysis has advantages during outbreaks or pandemics, as this strategy would reduce the time required for health care professionals to obtain specimens, as well as lessen their risk of becoming infected. Furthermore, self-swabbing could be used to identify ARI/ILI etiologies in the community that might be missed from reliance on medically-attended disease surveillance."
"Relative frequency, Possible Risk Factors, Viral Codetection Rates, and Seasonality of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children With Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Northeastern Brazil","Few studies, each limited to a single major city, have investigated the prevalence and seasonal patterns of different viruses among children with low respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in Northeastern Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and of 7 other viruses in children for LRTI in 4 capitals from this region, and investigate their association with several risk factors, including meteorological data.","L ower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are an important cause of mortality among children worldwide. 1 Viruses are the causative agent in a sizable proportion of pediatric LRTI cases, especially among children less than 1 year of age. 2 In affluent societies, the burden of such infections may be even higher, but deaths from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other associated LRTIs are several times more frequent in developing than in developed countries. 3 The frequency of LRTI from different respiratory viruses is clearly influenced by a seasonal pattern that may vary according to geographic location and climate conditions. 4, 5 However, the relative importance of RSV as the causative agent in LRTI varies widely in different geographic locations, and there is limited information on RSV seasonal patterns in tropical areas. 4, 6 In Brazil, RSV is the most common viral pathogen found in episodes of LRTI; other frequent viruses include influenza, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Some studies conducted in Brazil have suggested a clear seasonal pattern for RSV infections, with predominance from March to July, and a smaller number of cases in the summer months, especially November to February. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Other viruses have been investigated to a lesser extent, but a seasonal pattern was found for different respiratory viruses in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, where the winter is cold and dry. 10, 13, 20 Only a few studies were conducted to investigate the prevalence and seasonal patterns of different viral infections among children with an episode of LRTI seen at hospitals from Northeastern Brazil, where the winter is warm and wet. 14, 16, [21] [22] [23] [24] Such studies were typically conducted in only 1 major city in the region and have not allowed for concurrent assessments within different areas of the Northeastern region of Brazil. Moreover, they have used different eligibility criteria and methods for viral identification. In the current study, we adopted standardized criteria and methods to assess the frequency of infection with RSV and 7 other viruses in children aged less than 2 years old hospitalized due to an LRTI in 4 capitals (Aracajú, Salvador, Recife, and Maceió) from Northeastern Brazil over a period of 1 year. We also seek to evaluate the association between the frequency of LRTI in general, of RSV, and of the other viruses and meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and solar radiation)."
Endoplasmic Reticulum Localization of Secl2p Is Achieved by Two Mechanisms: Rerlp-dependent Retrieval That Requires the Transmembrane Domain and Rerlp-independent Retention That Involves the Cytoplasmic Domain,Yeast Sec12p is a type II transmembrane,"protein in the ER, which is essential for the formation of transport vesicles. From biochemical and morphological lines of evidence, we have proposed that Secl2p is localized to the ER by two mechanisms: static retention in the ER and dynamic retrieval from the early Golgi compartment. We have also shown that Rerlp, a membrane protein in the Golgi, is required for correct localization of Secl2p. In the present study, we have performed a systematic analysis to determine the ER localization signals in Sec12p corresponding to these two mechanisms. Both the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Sec12p show the ability to localize the protein to the ER. The effect of the TMD is potent and sufficient by itself for the ER localization and is strongly dependent on Rerlp. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain shows a moderate ER-localization capability which is independent of Rerlp. The rate of mannosyl modification has been measured to distinguish between retention and retrieval. The cytoplasmic domain significantly delays the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the TMD shows only a subtle retardation in the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi but strictly prevents the transport beyond there. From these observations, we conclude that the TMD mainly acts as the retrieval signal and the cytoplasmic domain contains the retention signal. This study not only supports the two-mechanisms hypothesis but also provides powerful tools to dissect the two."
A phylogenomic data-driven exploration of viral origins and evolution,"The origin of viruses remains mysterious because of their diverse and patchy molecular and functional makeup. Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data. We take full advantage of the wealth of available protein structural and functional data to explore the evolution of the proteomic makeup of thousands of cells and viruses. Despite the extremely reduced nature of viral proteomes, we established an ancient origin of the ""viral supergroup"" and the existence of widespread episodes of horizontal transfer of genetic information. Viruses harboring different replicon types and infecting distantly related hosts shared many metabolic and informational protein structural domains of ancient origin that were also widespread in cellular proteomes. Phylogenomic analysis uncovered a universal tree of life and revealed that modern viruses reduced from multiple ancient cells that harbored segmented RNA genomes and coexisted with the ancestors of modern cells. The model for the origin and evolution of viruses and cells is backed by strong genomic and structural evidence and can be reconciled with existing models of viral evolution if one considers viruses to have originated from ancient cells and not from modern counterparts.","The origin and evolution of viruses remain difficult to explain. This stems from numerous philosophical and technical issues, including an experimental focus on single genes and consequent failure to take into account the complete makeup of viral proteomes. Perhaps the most challenging problems plaguing the deep evolutionary studies of viruses are the fast evolution and high mutation rates of most viral genes [especially RNA viruses (1) ]. This makes it difficult to unify viral families especially using sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. For example, the latest (2014) report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes 7 orders, 104 families, 23 subfamilies, 505 genera, and 3186 viral species (2) . Under this classification, viral families belonging to the same order have likely diverged from a common ancestral virus. However, only 26 viral families have been assigned to an order, and the evolutionary relationships of most of them remain unclear. The number of viral families without an order is expected to continuously increase, especially with the discovery of novel viruses from atypical environments, and because genes of many viral families do not exhibit significant sequence similarities (3) . In fact, homologous proteins often diverge beyond recognition at sequence level after a relatively long evolutionary time has passed (4) . In such cases, traditional sequencebased homology searches [for example, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)] and alignment software perform very poorly. However, the three-dimensional (3D) packing of amino acid side chains in cores of protein structural domains retains its arrangement over long evolutionary periods (5) . Because homologous proteins often maintain 3D folds and biochemical properties, they can still be recognized at the structure and function levels (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, given the massive genetic and phenotypic viral diversity, this task has remained a big challenge."
"A Case of Asymptomatic, Localized, and Idiopathic Diffuse Alveolar Damage","Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a histological change in lung tissue, and is generally caused by an acute lung injury, which is characterized by bilateral and widespread damages. Localized DAD occurs very rarely. The causes for DAD are numerous, but the chief cause is acute interstitial pneumonia or acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, in cases of idiopathic manifestation. The 82-year-old patient, in this case study, showed a DAD lesion in only 1 lobe. The patient was otherwise healthy, with no previous symptoms of DAD. He was admitted to our medical center owing to localized infiltration, observed on his chest radiograph. Laboratory studies showed no signs of infections. DAD was confirmed by a surgical lung biopsy. The patient received corticosteroid treatment and had gradually improved. We report the case of a patient with localized, idiopathic DAD that cannot be classified as acute interstitial pneumonia or acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.","Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a typical pathological finding in cases of acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). However, DAD is caused by various such as infection, transplantation surgery, medication, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops after radiation treatment, acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (AEIIP), acute exacerbation of allergic alveolitis, and viral lung infections (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 influenza A) 1, 2 . From a clinical aspect, AIP and AEIIP are most commonly diagnosed, but the etiology of these disease remains unclear."
"Common cold in Team Finland during 2018 Winter Olympic Games (PyeongChang): epidemiology, diagnosis including molecular point-of-care testing (POCT) and treatment","Objectives The common cold is the main cause of medical time loss in elite sport. Rapid diagnosis has been a challenge that may be amenable to molecular point-ofcare testing (POCT). Methods We performed a prospective observational study of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. There were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. The chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. Two nasal swabs were taken at the onset of symptoms. One swab was analysed within 45 min using a molecular POCT for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. After the Games, the other swab was tested for 16 possible causative respiratory viruses using PCR in laboratory-based testing. Results 20 out of 44 (45%) athletes and 22 out of 68 (32%) staff members experienced symptoms of the common cold during a median stay of 21 days. Eleven (26%) samples tested virus-positive using POCT. All subjects with influenza (n=6) and 32 close contacts were treated with oseltamivir. The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 75% of the athletes and 68 % of the staff members. Seven virus clusters were identified. They were caused by coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. The virus infections spread readily within the team, most commonly within the same sport discipline. Conclusions The cold was indeed a common illness in Team Finland during the Winter Olympic Games. POCT proved to be clinically valuable, especially for influenza. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in most cases.","Elite athletes are predisposed to the common cold due to heavy physical and mental stress which may suppress both innate and adaptive immunity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Air travel, human crowding, housing with other athletes and competition all increase the susceptibility of an elite athlete to the common cold. 6 The Winter Olympic Games take place during periods of low temperatures and its timing coincides with epidemics of many respiratory viruses. The common cold has been said to be 'the most dreaded opponent' at the Winter Olympic Games, and may ruin the athlete's long-term goal of success. 7 The common cold is a prevalent, complex and heterogeneous illness. 8 More than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist, and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies. 9 10 Signs and symptoms of different viral infections overlap, and it is not possible to identify the aetiological agent on clinical grounds alone. 11 12 Antiviral treatment is only available for influenza, but virus-specific preventive measures may reduce the transmission of illnesses. 13 14 The aim of our prospective observational study was to investigate the occurrence and aetiology of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. We used recently developed molecular multiplexed POCT for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus at the Games site. 15 16 After the Games, we used laboratory-based PCR testing to detect 16 possible causative respiratory viruses."
796 www.eymj.org,"Purpose: In May 2015, South Korea experienced an epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the impacts of MERS epidemic on emergency care utilization and mortality in South Korea. Materials and Methods: A natural experimental study was conducted using healthcare utilization and mortality data of the entire Korean population. The number of monthly emergency room (ER) visits was investigated to identify changes in emergency care utilization during the MERS epidemic; these trends were also examined according to patients' demographic factors, disease severity, and region. Deaths within 7 days after visiting an ER were analyzed to evaluate the impact of the reduction in ER visits on mortality. Results: The number of ER visits during the peak of the MERS epidemic (June 2015) decreased by 33.1% compared to the average figures from June 2014 and June 2016. The decrease was observed in all age, sex, and income groups, and was more pronounced for low-acuity diseases (acute otitis media: 53.0%; upper respiratory infections: 45.2%) than for high-acuity diseases (myocardial infarctions: 14.0%; ischemic stroke: 16.6%). No substantial changes were detected for the highest-acuity diseases, with increases of 3.5% for cardiac arrest and 2.4% for hemorrhagic stroke. The number of deaths within 7 days of an ER visit did not change significantly. Conclusion: During the MERS epidemic, the number of ER visits decreased in all age, sex, and socioeconomic groups, and decreased most sharply for low-acuity diseases. Nonetheless, there was no significant change in deaths after emergency care.","The patterns of healthcare utilization change in infectious dis-ease outbreaks. Identifying the patterns of change is important for future preparedness and response. The effects on healthcare utilization of infectious disease epidemic depend on the characteristics of an infection. In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan, medical service utilization decreased due to fear of nosocomial transmission. 1, 2 However, in the 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza, which is highly infectious but has a low case-fatality rate, emergency care utilization increased. 3, 4 In 2015, South Korea (hereafter ""Korea"") experienced an epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In a vulnerable healthcare delivery system in which the gatekeeper function of primary clinics was weak, the first patient wandered through several different hospitals before being diag-"
UK newspapers' representations of the 2009e10 outbreak of swine flu: one health scare not over-hyped by the media?,"Background A/H1N1, more commonly referred to as swine flu, emerged in Mexico in spring 2009. It rapidly spread across the world and was classed as a global pandemic on 11 June 2009. Objective To analyse UK newsprint coverage of the swine flu pandemic. Methods Content analysis of 2374 newsprint articles published in eight UK national newspapers between 1","A/H1N1, more commonly referred to as swine flu, emerged in Mexico in spring 2009 1 and quickly spread across the world through international air travel, 2 infecting hundreds of thousands of people. On 27 April the first cases were confirmed in the UK. Following the approach set out in the UK Department of Health's National framework for responding to an influenza pandemic, 3 enhanced surveillance of cases and their contacts was instituted to minimise the spread of swine flu. Despite this, by May there were increased outbreaks across the UK and around the world, and on 11 June 2009 the WHO revised the alert to phase 6, thus declaring a global influenza pandemic, the first in over four decades. 4 As the pandemic status of the outbreak was declared, media attention was immense, with front page headlines, constant news updates and top story status as scientists and the media tried to understand the potential threat posed by the virus. During the summer of 2009, predictions from scientists and the then chief medical officer for England, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, suggested that, as a 'worst case' scenario, 30% of the UK population could be infected by the A/H1N1 virus, with 65 000 killed. The 'best case' scenario was given as 5% of the population contracting the virus, resulting in 3100 deaths. 5 Vaccine manufacturers were urgently developing a vaccine in preparation for the worst case and the government secured large quantities to immunise the British population. The strategy was to target the vaccination programme at those at greatest risk from A/H1N1, including people with underlying chronic health problems, pregnant women and young children, with a plan to roll it out later to the remaining population."

A total of 2194 plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked. This molecule set comprised of 290 alkaloids (68 indole alkaloids, 153 isoquinoline alkaloids, 5 quinoline alkaloids, 13 piperidine alkaloids, 14 steroidal alkaloids, and 37 miscellaneous alkaloids), 678 terpenoids (47 monoterpenoids, 169 sesquiterpenoids, 265 diterpenoids, 81 steroids, and 96 triterpenoids), 20 aurones, 81 chalcones, 349 flavonoids, 120 isoflavonoids, 74 lignans, 58 stilbenoids, 169 miscellaneous polyphenolic compounds, 100 coumarins, 28 xanthones, 67 quinones, and 160 miscellaneous phytochemicals. Dengue virus protein targets examined included dengue virus protease (NS2B-NS3pro), helicase (NS3 helicase), methyltransferase (MTase), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the dengue virus envelope protein. Polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, chalcones, and other phenolics were the most numerous of the strongly docking ligands for dengue virus protein targets.","Dengue fever is an acute viral infection caused by all four serotypes (1, 2, 3, or 4) of the dengue virus (DENV), and is one of the seventeen ""Neglected Tropical Diseases"" (NTDs) defined by the World Health Organization [1] . The highest incidence of dengue fever is in Southeast Asia, India, and the Neotropics; where the principal vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is found [2] . There are two well defined manifestations of dengue virus infection in humans, dengue fever and severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome, DHF/DSS) [3] . Dengue viral infections account for around 100 million cases of dengue fever and more than 500,000 cases of DHF/DSS each year [4] . India accounts for around 34% of the total global dengue infections while tropical America contributes around 14% [1, 5] .

Furthermore, a correlation between increased dengue infection risk and socioeconomic status has been demonstrated; poorer inhabitants with poor access to health services showed a significantly higher seroprevelence compared to wealthy inhabitants [10, 11] . A serological survey carried out in 2007-2008 in three neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro showed more than half the population was seropositive (60.3% in Higienópolis, a densely populated urban neighborhood, 56.1% in Tubiacanga, a suburban residential neighborhood, and 77.4% in Palmares, a recently settled slum) [8] ."
A bioinformatic filter for improved base-call accuracy and polymorphism detection using the Affymetrix GeneChip Õ whole-genome resequencing platform,"DNA resequencing arrays enable rapid acquisition of high-quality sequence data. This technology represents a promising platform for rapid highresolution genotyping of microorganisms. Traditional array-based resequencing methods have relied on the use of specific PCR-amplified fragments from the query samples as hybridization targets. While this specificity in the target DNA population reduces the potential for artifacts caused by cross-hybridization, the subsampling of the query genome limits the sequence coverage that can be obtained and therefore reduces the technique's resolution as a genotyping method. We have developed and validated an Affymetrix Inc. GeneChip array-based, whole-genome resequencing platform for Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. A set of bioinformatic filters that targeted systematic base-calling errors caused by cross-hybridization between the wholegenome sample and the array probes and by deletions in the sample DNA relative to the chip reference sequence were developed. Our approach eliminated 91% of the false-positive singlenucleotide polymorphism calls identified in the SCHU S4 query sample, at the cost of 10.7% of the true positives, yielding a total base-calling accuracy of 99.992%.","Detection, identification and typing of infectious microorganisms are crucial in many areas of basic and translational research. There is an urgent need for accurate, high-resolution microbial genotyping methods, in spite of the existence of a number of widely used typing methods. That is because the current methods offer only low-resolution and limited genotyping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), horizontal gene transfer and/or intragenic recombination are all known to lead to variations and genome plasticity in an organism. The diversity of an organism can be explicitly understood provided these events are identified and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively at the whole-genome level."
A pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of human coronavirus spike,"Continuously emerging highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) remain a major threat to human health, as illustrated in past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. The development of a drug with broad-spectrum HCoV inhibitory activity would address this urgent unmet medical need. Although previous studies have suggested that the HR1 of HCoV spike (S) protein is an important target site for inhibition against specific HCoVs, whether this conserved region could serve as a target for the development of broad-spectrum pan-CoV inhibitor remains controversial. Here, we found that peptide OC43-HR2P, derived from the HR2 domain of HCoV-OC43, exhibited broad fusion inhibitory activity against multiple HCoVs. EK1, the optimized form of OC43-HR2P, showed substantially improved pan-CoV fusion inhibitory activity and pharmaceutical properties. Crystal structures indicated that EK1 can form a stable six-helix bundle structure with both short -HCoV and long -HCoV HR1s, further supporting the role of HR1 region as a viable pan-CoV target site.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA and are associated with various natural hosts. CoVs are divided into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta groups, and the beta group is further composed of A, B, C, and D subgroups (Fig. 1A) (1). Among them, six CoVs can infect humans (HCoVs), including HCoV-229E (229E) and HCoV-NL63 (NL63) in the alpha group, HCoV-OC43 (OC43) and HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1) in beta subgroup A, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in beta subgroup B, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in beta subgroup C (2) ."
"A rapid, inexpensive yeast-based dual-fluorescence assay of programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting for high-throughput screening","Programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 PRF) is a mechanism that directs elongating ribosomes to shift-reading frame by 1 base in the 5 0 direction that is utilized by many RNA viruses. Importantly, rates of À1 PRF are fine-tuned by viruses, including Retroviruses, Coronaviruses, Flavivriuses and in two endogenous viruses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to deliver the correct ratios of different viral proteins for efficient replication. Thus, À1 PRF presents a novel target for antiviral therapeutics. The underlying molecular mechanism of À1 PRF is conserved from yeast to mammals, enabling yeast to be used as a logical platform for high-throughput screens. Our understanding of the strengths and pitfalls of assays to monitor À1 PRF have evolved since the initial discovery of À1 PRF. These include controlling for the effects of drugs on protein expression and mRNA stability, as well as minimizing costs and the requirement for multiple processing steps. Here we describe the development of an automated yeast-based dual fluorescence assay of À1 PRF that provides a rapid, inexpensive automated pipeline to screen for compounds that alter rates of À1 PRF which will help to pave the way toward the discovery and development of novel antiviral therapeutics.","Programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 PRF) is a mechanism by which cis-acting elements in an mRNA can direct elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by 1 base in the 5 0 direction (1-3). Many RNA viruses utilize À1 PRF, including most Retroviruses, Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses and Totiviruses. In Retroviruses and Totiviruses, the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the major viral nucleocapsid proteins (e.g. Gag) is located at the 5 0 -end of the mRNA whereas the ORFs encoding proteins with enzymatic functions (typically Pro and Pol) are located 3 0 of, and out of frame with, the Gag ORF. The mRNAs transcribed from these viral templates contain two overlapping ORFs. The enzymatic proteins are only translated as a result of a programmed ribosomal frameshift event that occurs with an efficiency of 1-40% depending on the specific virus and assay system employed (4) . Thus, the majority of translational events result in the production of the Gag protein, while a minority of frameshifts yield viral enzymatic proteins. The ratio of Gag to Gag-pol synthesized in viruses as a consequence of programmed frameshifting varies between a narrow window of 20:1 to 60:1 (2) . In Coronaviruses and Flaviviruses, frameshift events occur over a wider dynamic range to regulate the relative ratios of non-structural proteins (5) (6) (7) ."
Bat consumption in Thailand,"Background: Human consumption of bats poses an increasing public health threat globally. Communities in which bat guano is mined from caves have extensive exposure to bat excreta, often harvest bats for consumption, and are at risk for bat-borne diseases.","Z oonotic pathogens cause an estimated 70% of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in humans (1Á3). Bats in particular are important wild animal reservoirs for zoonotic viruses, as they host more viruses per species than other mammals (4) . Several emerging diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (5) , Ebola virus (6, 7) , Nipah virus (8) , and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (9) , have been linked to bats. There is nevertheless little research on bat and human interaction, the human perceptions about bats and the associated disease risk, and the populations that are the most at risk (10) ."
Exacerbation of Japanese Encephalitis by CD11c hi Dendritic Cell Ablation Is Associated with an Imbalance in Regulatory Foxp3 + and IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 Cells and in Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo Monocytes BRIEF COMMUNICATION,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is neuroinflammation characterized by uncontrolled infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c hi dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice. Moreover, CD11c hi DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE. Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro-and anti-inflammation during JE progression. The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells, and CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes. CD11c hi DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells. This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and RORgT in CD4 + T cells from the brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. In addition, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, CD11c hi DC ablation altered the phenotype and function of CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes, resulting in lower levels of activation marker and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-b) expression. Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c hi DC ablation caused an imbalance in CD4 + Th17/Treg cells and CD11b + Ly-6C hi /Ly-6C lo monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression. This imbalanced orchestration of pro-and anti-inflammatory leukocytes following CD11c hi DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE. [Immune Network 2017;17(3):192-200] ","Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), and Zika viruses, are major current and emerging threats to millions of people worldwide. Among the neurotropic flaviviruses, JE virus (JEV) is considered the most serious because of its neurotropical impacts, higher fatality rate, and permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae (1) . The expanding geographical range of JEV and potential for outbreaks of JE in nonimmune populations demand an urgent effort to develop effective antiviral therapies or alternate strategies to limit the immunopathology of JE (2) . Indeed, considerable progress in immunopathological studies of JE has been made in both infected patients and murine models (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . JEV replicates in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) as primary target cells (9) , and in these cells, the virus travels from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), where it causes neurological disorders (10) ."
The Ebola clinical trials: a precedent for research ethics in disasters,"The West African Ebola epidemic has set in motion a collective endeavour to conduct accelerated clinical trials, testing unproven but potentially lifesaving interventions in the course of a major public health crisis. This unprecedented effort was supported by the recommendations of an ad hoc ethics panel convened in August 2014 by the WHO. By considering why and on what conditions the exceptional circumstances of the Ebola epidemic justified the use of unproven interventions, the panel's recommendations have challenged conventional thinking about therapeutic development and clinical research ethics. At the same time, unanswered ethical questions have emerged, in particular: (i) the specification of exceptional circumstances, (ii) the specification of unproven interventions, (iii) the goals of interventional research in terms of individual versus collective interests, (iv) the place of adaptive trial designs and (v) the exact meaning of compassionate use with unapproved interventions.","It appears that the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic is finally subsiding, after having caused the death of more than 11 000 of the people infected by the virus. Probably many more fell ill or died as a consequence of the disruption of health services in the most affected countries. 1 On 11 August 2014, a few days after declaring a public health emergency of international concern, the Director General of the WHO convened a panel of experts to consider the pressing ethical questions raised by the existence of potentially effective but untested biomedical interventions for Ebola virus disease (EVD). The panel of 12 members concluded unanimously that: ""In the particular context of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, it is ethically acceptable to offer unproven interventions that have shown promising results in the laboratory and in animal models but have not yet been evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans as potential treatment or prevention"". 2 The set of recommendations issued at the conclusion of the advisory meeting opened the path to broader consultations and to the conduct of scientifically sound clinical trials during the course of a major public health emergency. In a matter of months, under the oversight of national, international and academic ethics committees, a number of clinical trials with efficacy endpoints could be conducted at appropriate sites of Ebola outbreaks, testing novel or repurposed therapeutic agents, 3 or convalescent plasma. 4 In addition, phase II/III trials of Ebola vaccines could be organised in a matter of months in West Africa. 5 A community cluster trial using an innovative design has so far provided sufficient evidence of vaccine efficacy 6 to advance industrial production. The pace of clinical trials triggered by the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic has thus been remarkably fast, challenging the usual benchmarks of therapeutic development."
Highly similar structural frames link the template tunnel and NTP entry tunnel to the exterior surface in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential to viral replication and is therefore one of the primary targets of countermeasures against these dangerous infectious agents. Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting polymerases has been hampered by the extreme sequence variability of these sequences. RdRps range in length from 400-800 residues, yet contain only $20 residues that are conserved in most species. In this study, we made structure-based comparisons that are independent of sequence composition using a recently developed algorithm. We identified residue-to-residue correspondences of multiple protein structures and created (two-dimensional) structure-based alignment maps of 37 polymerase structures that provide both sequence and structure details. Using these maps, we determined that $75% of each polymerase species consists of seven protein segments, each of which has high structural similarity to segments in other species, though they are widely divergent in sequence composition and order. We define each of these segments as a 'homomorph', and each includes (though most are much larger than) the well-known conserved polymerase motifs. All homomorphs contact the template tunnel or nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein, suggesting they constitute a structural and functional skeleton common among the polymerases.","The polymerase protein family has been studied extensively for >40 years. This interest has been motivated by their unique function-to replicate all forms of life, and confounded by their sequence diversity. As more tertiary structures of polymerase were solved, it became apparent that widely diverse sequences form highly similar structures. There has not, until recently, been a time-effective computational method to make detailed comparisons of these observations. The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between structure and sequence in a group of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) that replicate many of the viruses that represent significant threats to life throughout the world. We selected well-studied species in order to maximize the amount of experimental data that could be used to evaluate the association of functional residues and structure (Table 1) . We used the StralSV algorithm (1) to perform structure comparisons between all of the selected species. We created maps of residue-to-residue (R2R) correspondence from which we determined the boundaries of structurally similar segments-which we named 'homomorphs'. In contrast to the relatively short lengths of previously described motifs, we found that most homomorphs are long, and each provides a structural connection between the template tunnel or NTP entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein."
FULL PAPER Virology Development of a one-run real-time PCR detection system for pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases,"The etiology of Porcine respiratory disease complex is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, and multiple infections increase the difficulty in identifying the causal pathogen. In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay's clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency. These results suggest that Dempo-PCR assay can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine respiratory corona virus (PRCV), Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) [7, 8, 15, 20] . Infection with each single pathogen does not necessarily result in appearance of symptoms, but complex infections with a variety of pathogens, including the indigenous agents, develop severe conditions. Infections with such multiple pathogens make it difficult to rapidly identify the etiology of PRDC. To adopt appropriate measures, such as vaccination or hygiene management, and to minimize the economic loss of PRDC, it is necessary to quickly, accurately and comprehensively detect multiple pathogens present in varying proportions in each herd. Serological tests [13] , pathogen isolation [22] and PCR-based tests [1, 11] are currently available to diagnose PRDC in laboratories. Most tests are based on a one assay-one pathogen approach, and they are not enough for diagnosis of PRDC in terms of comprehensiveness and rapidity. Tsuchiaka et al. previously developed a system to detect microbes in bovine diarrhea by TaqMan real-time PCR, permitting the simultaneous screening of 19 pathogens associated with diarrhea [26] . TaqMan real-time PCR possesses the advantages of high sensitivity, high specificity, and simple operation."
Regulation of Nucleotide Metabolism and Germline Proliferation in Response to Nucleotide Imbalance and Genotoxic Stresses by EndoU Nuclease HHS Public Access,"Nucleotide deprivation and imbalance present detrimental conditions for animals and are thus expected to trigger cellular responses that direct protective changes in metabolic, developmental, and behavioral programs, albeit such mechanisms are vastly underexplored. Following our previous finding that Caenorhabditis elegans shut down germ cell proliferation in response to pyrimidine deprivation, we find in this study that endonuclease ENDU-2 regulates nucleotide metabolism and germ cell proliferation in response to nucleotide imbalance and other genotoxic stress, and that it affects mitotic chromosomal segregation in the intestine and lifespan. ENDU-2 expression is induced by nucleotide imbalance and genotoxic stress, and ENDU-2 exerts its function in the intestine, mostly by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 through repressing the PKA pathway and histone deacetylase HDA-1. Human EndoU also affects the response to genotoxic drugs. Our work reveals an unknown role of ENDU-2 in regulating nucleotide metabolism and animals' response to genotoxic stress, which may link EndoU function to cancer treatment.","Nucleotides (NTs) are building blocks for DNAs and RNAs and indispensable for many important cellular processes, such as DNA damage response and energy production. Both the absolute levels and the balance between different NTs are critical for genome stability (Pai and Kearsey, 2017) . Therefore, to survive the fluctuation in NT levels due to changes in diet or internal NT metabolic conditions, animals are expected to have evolved cellular mechanisms that sense and respond to NT level changes. Although there have been extensive studies regarding the impact of nucleotide imbalance on cell-cycle progression, DNA replication, and genome stability mainly using cultured cells or yeast (Pai and Kearsey, 2017) , the mechanisms that regulate developmental and metabolic events in animal models in response to NT changes are underexplored."
Emerging viruses and current strategies for vaccine intervention,"During the past decade several notable viruses have suddenly emerged from obscurity or anonymity to become serious global health threats, provoking concern regarding their sustained epidemic transmission in immunologically naive human populations. With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development. Indeed, vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or non-existent, or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited. While classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non-replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms. Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility.",Immunization is arguably the most appropriate way of preventing infectious disease. The control of many important viral pathogens by vaccination is perhaps one of the outstanding achievements of medical intervention.
The Journal of Infectious Diseases Fully Human Immunoglobulin G From Transchromosomic Bovines Treats Nonhuman Primates Infected With Ebola Virus Makona Isolate,"Transchromosomic bovines (Tc-bovines) adaptively produce fully human polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies after exposure to immunogenic antigen(s). The National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research and collaborators rapidly produced and then evaluated anti-Ebola virus IgG immunoglobulins (collectively termed SAB-139) purified from Tc-bovine plasma after sequential hyperimmunization with an Ebola virus Makona isolate glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccine. SAB-139 was characterized by several in vitro production, research, and clinical level assays using wild-type Makona-C05 or recombinant virus/antigens from different Ebola virus variants. SAB-139 potently activates natural killer cells, monocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has high-binding avidity demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. SAB-139 has similar concentrations of galactose-α-1,3-galactose carbohydrates compared with human-derived intravenous Ig, and the IgG1 subclass antibody is predominant. All rhesus macaques infected with Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/2014/Makona-C05 and treated with sufficient SAB-139 at 1 day (n = 6) or 3 days (n = 6) postinfection survived versus 0% of controls. This study demonstrates that Tc-bovines can produce pathogen-specific human Ig to prevent and/or treat patients when an emerging infectious disease either threatens to or becomes an epidemic.","Several passive immunotherapeutics are under development to treat emerging infectious diseases and filoviruses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, traditional human-derived and heterologous animal-derived polyclonal immunoglobulins (Igs) and monoclonal antibodies can have lengthy development and/or clinical safety issues [1, 7, 8] . To address these shortcomings, genetically modified transchromosomic bovines (Tc-bovines) were developed that adaptively produce fully human polyclonal antibodies after exposure to environmental or vaccine antigens [9] [10] [11] [12] . After hyperimmunization, Tc-bovine fully human IgG (Tc-hIgG) can be rapidly produced from their plasma [13] [14] [15] [16] . Tc-bovines, depending upon age and size, produce 150 to 600 grams of purified Tc-hIgG per month. Experimental high-titer Tc-hIgGs were produced against several pathogens and demonstrated efficacy in animal models. In a recent study, 2 Tc-hIgG Investigational New Drug applications (ClinicalTrials.gov nos. NCT02788188 and NCT02508584) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) [17] and Mycoplasma hominis indications (termed SAB-301 and SAB-136, respectively). SAB-301 was safe and well tolerated in a completed phase I clinical trial with an average terminal IgG elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of ~28 days (d) that is similar to human-derived intravenous Ig (IVIG) [18] . SAB-136 was safe and efficacious in a phase I clinical trial that treated a patient with severe immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobinemia, and chronic M hominis septic hip and polyarthritis. The patient received SAB-136 for 1 year, and the drug was well tolerated with no significant adverse events and displayed and his clinical parameters improved with decreased mycoplasma burden [19] ."
TITLE (PROVISIONAL) Household Preparedness for Emergency Events: a cross-sectional survey on residents in four regions of China AUTHORS VERSION 1 -REVIEW REVIEWER,"The authors carried out a multistage stratified survey of 3,541 households representative of the population in four regions of China. They classified households as being ""well prepared"" for an emergency based on possession or affirmation of nine of fourteen ""indicators"" in a standard checklist. Fewer than 10% of households were considered ""well prepared,"" while many professed ignorance or lack of interest in preparedness. Preparedness was associated with participation in emergency training and knowledge, and was negatively associated with reliance on external rescuers as well as a fatalistic outlook.","research and conducted the survey."" Elsewhere in the manuscript, however (p. 2), an unspecified number of graduate students are said to have ""input these data into computer software Epidata ..."" The division of labor is not clear. While data processing is obviously an indispensable part of the overall effort, in the US and most European countries data entry is considered a clerical task that does not automatically merit authorship of a manuscript. From the authorship page (page 1) it appears that nine of the authors are academics of associate or higher professorial rank. This is an unusually large number, such as one might encounter in a study that required multi-disciplinary collaboration (e.g., a single study which involved experts in environmental science, GIS technology, analytical biochemistry, PCR or other genetic assays, ""big data,"" biostatistics, etc.). Having done many very large scale studies, I fully appreciate the quantity of effort involved, but I also know that much of the effort in the type of survey on which this paper is based is at the level of field management and data preparation, which is typically acknowledged in a sentence or two. The corresponding authors need to provide a more substantial description of the respective roles of their numerous co-authors in the intellectual design, analysis, and interpretation."
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ASTROVIRUS AND CORONAVIRUS IN POULTS IN THE SOUTH EASTERN REGION OF BRAZIL,"A survey of Turkey Coronavirus (TCoV) and Astrovirus (TAstV-2) prevalence was carried out from February to December during 2006 year in semiarid region of Brazil, from a turkey producer area, localized in South Eastern of Brazil. To asses the risk factor related to clinical material, climatic condition and type of RT-PCR applied, cloacal swabs (CS), faeces, sera, bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus (TH) and spleen (SP) and ileumcaeca region were collected from 30-day-old poults suffering of enteritis episode characterized as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). The PEMS clinical features were characterized by watery to foamy faeces, light brown-yellow in colour and low mortality rate. Meteorological data (rainfall and relative humidity) observed during along the study presented monthly average temperature ranging from 39.3 and 31.2ºC, precipitation in rainy season from 40 to 270.3 mm/month, and no rain during dry season. Simplex RT-PCR gave odds ratio (OR) values suggesting that ileum-caeca region is at higher chance (OR=1.9; p=0.9741) to have both viral RNA than faeces (OR=1.5; p=0.7319). However, multiplex RT-PCR showed 3.98 (p=0.89982) more chance to give positive results in faeces than CS at dry season. The major risk factors seem to be low rate of humidity and high temperatures at winter, probably responsible for spread, easily, the TCoV and TAstv-2 among the flocks. The positive results of both virus suggested that they can play an important role in enteric disorders, associated to low humidity and high temperatures frequently found in tropical countries.","Avian astroviruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus of the Astroviridae family. The viral particles are small, non-enveloped, positive sense RNA viruses, 28 to 30nm in diameter, and have a star-like morphology (21) . Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) was first described in 1980 by McNulty et al. (22) in the United Kingdom, and the first isolated of TAstV in the United States was identified in 1985 (15) . A second TAstV type, which was antigenically and genetically distinct from the previously identified as TAstV-1, was isolated 1996 and designated as TAstV-2 (13, 31, 32) . The entire genome sequence of the TAstV-2 isolate, NC/96, has been reported and bears many similar features to Human Astrovirus (HAstV) (15) . Moreover, astroviruses are linked with enteric disease in humans and young animals such as calves, lambs, pigs, dogs, cats and minks (15, 21) . The most important infectious disease caused by TAstV are the enteric diseases affecting the digestive tract of commercial poults proposed to result in more economic loss than those affecting any other system reported worldwide, including Brazil (16, 17, 26, 27, 28, 30, 34, 35) . In addition, no vaccine currently exists for the enteric disease caused by astroviruses, which leads the disease to the bio-security manners to control virus infection and spread (15) ."
Susceptibility of Chikungunya Virus to Inactivation by Heat and Commercially and World Health Organization- Recommended Biocides,"Despite increasing clinical relevance of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, caused by a rapidly emerging pathogen, recommended guidelines for its inactivation do not exist. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of CHIKV to inactivation by heat and commercially available hand, surface, and World Health Organization-recommended disinfectants to define CHIKV prevention protocols for healthcare systems.","Over the past decades, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, has spread globally. Although the virus has already been isolated in 1953, in-depth research has been limited since then and was primarily motivated by sporadic outbreaks like the French island La Reunion outbreak in 2005/2006 [1] . Although CHIKV is mainly transmitted via bites of hematophagous arthropods such as mosquitoes (eg, Aedes aegypti), nonvector transmission through contaminated saliva has been reported in an experimental mouse model [2] . Therefore, additional routes of viral transmission formally cannot be excluded. Infection with CHIKV often results in acute illness characterized by the classic triad of fever, arthralgia, and rash, and it can become chronic in a subset of patients. Recent outbreaks in Southeast Asia and South America [3] as well as genetic adaptation to new vectors including Aedes albopictus [4] justify the growing perception of CHIKV as a global health concern. However, guidelines on handling contamination and occupational exposure as well as confirmed procedures of virus inactivation and disinfection have not been established to date."
Chloroquine diphosphate: a risk factor for herpes zoster in patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis,"OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster has been widely described in the context of different systemic autoimmune diseases but not dermatomyositis/polymyositis. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence, risk factors and herpes zoster outcomes in this population. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections in dermatomyositis/polymyositis patients was performed. The patients were followed at a tertiary center from 1991 to 2012. For the control group, each patient with herpes zoster was paired with two patients without herpes zoster. Patients were matched by gender and the type of myositis, age at myositis onset and disease duration. RESULTS: Of 230 patients, 24 (10.4%) had a histories of herpes zoster (19 with dermatomyositis and five with polymyositis, two-thirds female). The mean age of the patients with herpes zoster was 44.6¡16.8 years. No difference between the groups was found regarding cumulative clinical manifestations. Disease activity, autoantibody, muscle and leukogram parameters were also comparable between the groups. No differences in immunosuppressive (alone or in association with other immunosuppressive therapies) or glucocorticoid (current use, medium dose and cumulative dose in the last two months) therapies were found between patients with and without herpes zoster. However, a higher proportion of patients in the herpes zoster group received chloroquine diphosphate compared to the control group. All of the patients received acyclovir; 58.3% of patients had postherpetic neuralgia and no cases of recurrence were reported. Furthermore, individuals who were taking high prednisone doses at the time of the herpes zoster diagnosis had reduced levels of postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chloroquine diphosphate could predispose patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis to developing herpes zoster, particularly women and dermatomyositis patients.","Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies encompass a heterogeneous group of systemic autoimmune diseases, including polymyositis (PM), which is characterized by symmetrical proximal and progressive muscle weakness of the limbs and dermatomyositis (DM), which, in addition to muscle involvement, includes skin abnormalities, such as heliotrope and Gottron's papules (1, 2) ."
The Signal Sequence of the p62 Protein of Semliki Forest Virus Is Involved in Initiation but Not in Completing Chain Translocation,"So far it has been demonstrated that the signal sequence of proteins which are made at the ER functions both at the level of protein targeting to the ER and in initiation of chain translocation across the ER membrane. However, its possible role in completing the process of chain transfer (see Singer, S. J., P. A. Maher, and M. P. Yaffe. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987. 84:1015-1019) has remained elusive. In this work we show that the p62 protein of Semliki Forest virus contains an uncleaved signal sequence at its NH2-terminus and that this becomes glycosylated early during synthesis and translocation of the p62 polypeptide. As the glycosylation of the signal sequence most likely occurs after its release from the ER membrane our results suggest that this region has no role in completing the transfer process.","IOSYNTHESIS of proteins at the ER can be subdivided into several steps. These are (a) targeting of translation complexes to the ER membrane; (b) synthesis and transfer (translocation) of the polypeptide chain across the lipid bilayer; and (c) protein maturation in the lumen of ER (chain folding, disulphide bridge formation, glycosylation, and oligomerization). The mechanisms for these processes have been studied extensively during recent years (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Wickner and Lodish, 1985; Rapoport, 1986; Lodish, 1988; Rothman, 1989) . A most important finding has been that all proteins made at the ER carry a signal sequence (also called signal peptide), a hydrophobic peptide which is usually located at the NH2-terminal region of the polypeptide chain. One function of the signal peptide is to achieve targeting of the polysome to the ER membrane (Rapoport, 1986) . When the signal sequence emerges from the ribosome it binds to the signal recognition particle, which mediates binding of the polysome to the docking protein in the ER. After this another function of the signal sequence is expressed, that is to interact with some components of the ER membrane and thereby initiate translocation of the polypeptide chain into the lumen of the ER (Gilmore and Blobel, 1985; Robinson et al., 1987; Wiedmann et al., 1987) . Further synthesis of the polypeptide then continues with concomitant chain translocation. An important but as yet unresolved question is whether the signal sequence has any role in the translocation process per se or whether its functions are limited to the targeting and translocation-initiation steps. For instance, Singer and co-workers Danny Huylebroeck's present address is Innogenetics, Industriepark 7, Box 4, B-9710, Ghent, Belgium."
Synergistic effect of ribavirin and vaccine for protection during early infection stage of foot-and-mouth disease,"In many countries, vaccines are used for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). However, because there is no protection against FMD immediately after vaccination, research and development on antiviral agents is being conducted to induce protection until immunological competence is produced. This study tested whether well-known chemicals used as RNA virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on FMD viruses (FMDVs) and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against FMDV in vitro/in vivo. In addition, it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals. Antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines, thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine. Finally, pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion. Based on these results, it is expected that this combined approach could be a therapeutic and preventive treatment for early protection against FMD.","Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) occurs in animals with cloven hooves. FMD viruses (FMDVs) are a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [16] and belong to the genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae [4] ; the size of the virus genome is approximately 8.5 kb. These viruses are classified into seven serotypes-A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3and more than 60 subtypes [16] . FMD outbreaks cause a reduction in the productivity of infected animals (e.g., pigs, cows, lambs, and goats) [2, 3] . The culling of infected animals and events such as environmental contamination and loss of revenue from the livestock have emerged as important socioeconomic issues [21, 23] ."
"Association of TNF-α -308G/A, SP-B 1580 C/T, IL-13 -1055 C/T gene polymorphisms and latent adenoviral infection with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in an Egyptian population","Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of disability and death. The most common cause of COPD is smoking. There is evidence suggesting that genetic factors influence COPD susceptibility and variants in several candidate genes have been significantly associated with COPD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association of the TNF-α -308, SPB+1580, IL-13 -1055 gene polymorphisms and latent adenovirus C infection with COPD in an Egyptian population. Material and methods: Our study included 115 subjects (75 smokers with COPD, 25 resistant smokers and 15 non-smokers) who were subjected to spirometric measurements, identification of adenovirus C and genotyping of TNF-α -308G/A, SP-B+1580 C/T and IL-13 -1055 C/T polymorphisms by real-time PCR. Results: The adenovirus C gene was identified in all subjects. The distribution of TNF-α genotypes showed no significant differences between different groups. However, homozygous A genotype was associated with a significant decrease in FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC and FEF25/75% of predicted in COPD (p < 0.05). As regards SP-B genotypes, resistant smokers had a significantly higher homozygous T genotype frequency compared to COPD and non smokers (p = 0.005). Interleukin 13 genotypes showed no significant difference between different groups. There was a significant decrease in FEF25/75% of predicted in T allele carriers in COPD patients (p = 0.001). Conclusions: The COPD is a disease caused by the interaction of combined genes and environmental influences, in the presence of smoking and latent adenovirus C infection, TNF-α -308A, SPB +1580 T and IL-13 -1055 T polymorphisms predispose to the development of COPD.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex mix of signs and symptoms in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema that largely results from cigarette smoking [1] . Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that genetic factors influence COPD susceptibility as well; severe α1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the proven genetic determinants of COPD [2] . Variants in several candidate genes have been significantly associated with COPD, suggesting an interaction between genetic and environmental influences [3] ."
Avoiding Regions Symptomatic of Conformational and Functional Flexibility to Identify Antiviral Targets in Current and Future Coronaviruses,"Within the last 15 years, two related coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS]-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]-CoV) expanded their host range to include humans, with increased virulence in their new host. Coronaviruses were recently found to have little intrinsic disorder compared with many other virus families. Because intrinsically disordered regions have been proposed to be important for rewiring interactions between virus and host, we investigated the conservation of intrinsic disorder and secondary structure in coronaviruses in an evolutionary context. We found that regions of intrinsic disorder are rarely conserved among different coronavirus protein families, with the primary exception of the nucleocapsid. Also, secondary structure predictions are only conserved across 50-80% of sites for most protein families, with the implication that 20-50% of sites do not have conserved secondary structure prediction. Furthermore, nonconserved structure sites are significantly less constrained in sequence divergence than either sites conserved in the secondary structure or sites conserved in loop. Avoiding regions symptomatic of conformational flexibility such as disordered sites and sites with nonconserved secondary structure to identify potential broad-specificity antiviral targets, only one sequence motif (five residues or longer) remains from the >10,000 starting sites across all coronaviruses in this study. The identified sequence motif is found within the nonstructural protein (NSP) 12 and constitutes an antiviral target potentially effective against the present day and future coronaviruses. On shorter evolutionary timescales, the SARS and MERS clades have more sequence motifs fulfilling the criteria applied. Interestingly, many motifs map to NSP12 making this a prime target for coronavirus antivirals.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV are two closely related zoonotic coronaviruses. Both have successfully crossed the species barrier to allow animal-to-human transmission, and further to allow human-to-human transmission (Song et al. 2005; Reusken et al. 2016) . The SARS outbreak in 2003 had a mortality rate of 10% (Anderson et al. 2010) , and SARS-CoV was considered the most aggressive coronavirus compared to other human coronaviruses that commonly cause mild to moderate infection in their hosts (van der Hoek 2007) . MERS-CoV is the cause of an ongoing outbreak of the respiratory illness MERS (de Groot et al. 2013) . At the time of writing, 1791 MERS cases have been confirmed with a mortality rate of approximately 35% (World Health Organization 2016). Both MERS and SARS have higher mortality rates in elderly and immunosuppressed populations (Gralinski and Baric 2015) ."
ViPR: an open bioinformatics database and analysis resource for virology research,"The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR, www.ViPRbrc.org) is an integrated repository of data and analysis tools for multiple virus families, supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRC) program. ViPR contains information for human pathogenic viruses belonging to the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Togaviridae families, with plans to support additional virus families in the future. ViPR captures various types of information, including sequence records, gene and protein annotations, 3D protein structures, immune epitope locations, clinical and surveillance metadata and novel data derived from comparative genomics analysis. Analytical and visualization tools for metadatadriven statistical sequence analysis, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, BLAST comparison and sequence variation determination are also provided. Data filtering and analysis workflows can be combined and the results saved in personal 'Workbenches' for future use. ViPR tools and data are available without charge as a service to the virology research community to help facilitate the development of diagnostics, prophylactics and therapeutics for priority pathogens and other viruses.","Viral disease outbreaks tend to occur every several years in the human population (1) (2) (3) (4) . During such outbreaks, identification of the causative agent and comparative genomic analysis can be critical to limiting the spread of the virus and identifying suitable treatment options. While the first lines of defense against such outbreaks are clinical reporting and automated surveillance, 'wet lab' experimentation of viral isolates is also important. Bioinformatics tools and database resources that provide information about the genomic structures and phenotypic characteristics of known viruses can make this process more efficient by supporting data mining for the development of hypotheses worthy of in-depth laboratory experimentation on the emerging strain."
,"We aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of prolonged macrolide (PMC), corticosteroids (CST), doxycycline (DXC), and levofloxacin (LFX) against macrolideunresponsive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia in children and to evaluate the safety of the secondary treatment agents. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with MP pneumonia hospitalized between January 2015 and April 2017. Macrolide-unresponsiveness was clinically defined with a persistent fever of ≥ 38.0°C at ≥ 72 hours after macrolide treatment. The cases were divided into four groups: PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX. We compared the time to defervescence (TTD) after secondary treatment and the TTD after initial macrolide treatment in each group with adjustment using propensity score-matching analysis. Results: Among 1,165 cases of MP pneumonia, 190 (16.3%) were unresponsive to macrolides. The proportion of patients who achieved defervescence within 48 hours in CST, DXC, and LFX groups were 96.9% (31/33), 85.7% (12/14), and 83.3% (5/6), respectively. The TTD after initial macrolide treatment did not differ between PMC and CST groups (5.1 vs. 4.2 days, P = 0.085), PMC and DXC groups (4.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.453), and PMC and LFX groups (4.4 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.283). No side effects were observed in the CST, DXC, and LFX groups. Conclusion: The change to secondary treatment did not show better efficacy compared to PMC in children with macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia. Further studies are needed to guide appropriate treatment in children with MP pneumonia.","Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is one of the most common pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents. It can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, from mild respiratory symptoms to severe fatal pneumonia with extrapulmonary Given the increase of MRMP, some secondary treatment agents, such as corticosteroids, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones, have been considered for the treatment of MRMP pneumonia, although several studies have suggested that macrolides have clinical efficacy for the treatment of MRMP. [17] [18] [19] Tetracyclines, including minocycline and doxycycline, have been reported as alternative agents for children with MRMP. 20,21 However, they are not recommended for use in patients younger than 8 years of age, because tetracyclines can cause tooth discoloration in children during the periods of osteogenesis and odontogenesis. 22 In addition, fluoroquinolones have been associated with a risk of musculoskeletal toxicities, including tendinitis, arthritis, and growth impairment in children. 23 Although there is still lack of information on their safety in children, it was reported that there were no clinically detectable adverse events for up to 5 years after treatment with levofloxacin (LFX). 24 Some studies have reported the clinical effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids (CST) in the treatment of refractory MP pneumonia, because hyper-reaction of the host immune system may contribute to its pathogenesis. 25, 26 However, CST can also cause several side effects, such as growth disorder, glucose intolerance, and the suppression of the immune system. 27 We aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of prolonged macrolides (PMCs), CST, doxycycline (DXC), and LFX against macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia in children, and to evaluate the safety of CST, DXC, and LFX."
,"The converging epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have generated a significant public health burden, however, previous studies have been limited to a small number of patients. This nationwide cohort study aimed to assess the rate of developing active TB among patients receiving dialysis for ESRD. Methods: The Korean national health insurance database was used to identify patients receiving dialysis for new-onset ESRD during 2004-2013, who were propensity score matched to an equivalent number of non-dialysis subjects from the general population. The incidences of active TB in the ESRD and control cohorts were calculated for 2004-2013, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the ESRD-related risk of active TB. Results: During 2004-2013, 59,584 patients received dialysis for newly diagnosed ESRD. In the dialysis and control cohorts, 457 (0.8%) and 125 (0.2%) cases of active TB were detected, respectively. Patients with ESRD were associated with a significantly higher risk of active TB compared to the controls (incidence rate ratio, 4.80). The ESRD cohort had an independently elevated risk of active TB (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.39; 95% confidence interval, 3.60-5.37). Conclusion: We found that patients receiving dialysis for ESRD had an elevated risk of active TB. These results highlight the need for detailed and well-organised guidelines for active TB screening among patients with ESRD.","Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health threat and remains a major cause of death from infectious diseases. Among the many risk factors for active TB, 1 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that requires dialysis has recently been highlighted because of the high global prevalence of this condition, which is related to the increased incidence of diabetes and aging populations in both developing and developed countries. 2, 3 Korea is confronted with increasing populations of elderly individuals and patients with diabetes, which has led to a rapid increase in the number of patients with ESRD. 4 Thus, the convergence of the TB and ESRD epidemics is generating a significant public health burden and making it difficult to control TB in Korea, which has an intermediate TB-related burden."
Infectious complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: current status and future per- spectives in Korea,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a treatment for hematologic malignancies, immune deficiencies, or genetic diseases, ect. Recently, the number of HSCTs performed in Korea has increased and the outcomes have improved. However, infectious complications account for most of the morbidity and mortality after HSCT. Post-HSCT infectious complications are usually classified according to the time after HSCT: pre-engraftment, immediate post-engraftment, and late post-engraftment period. In addition, the types and risk factors of infectious complications differ according to the stem cell source, donor type, conditioning intensity, region, prophylaxis strategy, and comorbidities, such as graft-versushost disease and invasive fungal infection. In this review, we summarize infectious complications after HSCT, focusing on the Korean perspectives.","Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), known previously as bone marrow transplantation, is performed to treat two broad categories of diseases. The first category consists of functional failure of bone marrow or marrow-derived cells, including aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, immunodeficiency syndromes (severe combined immune deficiency or chronic granulomatous disease), genetic diseases (mucopolysaccharidosis, glycogen storage diseases, etc.), or hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, etc.). In such cases, HSCT is applied to replace the de-fective, non-functional bone marrow tissues. Diseases in the second category-which includes hematologic malignancies such as acute or chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms-are more common indications for HSCT, the performance of which aims (1) to restore the myelosuppressive or myeloablative effect of cytotoxic treatment (such as intensive chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation [TBI]) to eliminate malignant cells, and (2) to induce a graft-versus-leukemic effect by providing anti-neoplastic immune cells expressing tumor-specific or -associated antigens [1, 2] ."
NOTE Feline coronavirus antibody titer in cerebrospinal fluid from cats with neurological signs,"To investigate the utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibody test for diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), the antibody titers were tested in CSF and sera from 271 FIP-suspected neurological cats. CSF antibody was detected in 28 cats, which were divided into 2 groups; 15 with CSF titer of 1:80 or lower and 13 with CSF titer of 1:640 or higher. In the latter group, reciprocal serum titer/reciprocal CSF titer was 8 or lower, which is extremely lower than normal range (256-2048), and FCoV RNA was detected in all of 11 CSF samples assayed by RT-PCR. Our findings indicate that CSF titer of 1:640 or higher may be served as a candidate for the index for diagnosing FIP.","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated progressive systemic infectious disease that occurs in domestic cats and wild felids, and is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV), a single-stranded RNA virus. FCoV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and usually causes mild to inapparent enteritis, and FIP is considered to be induced by a virulent mutant of the enteric FCoV [16, 22] . It is divided into 2 clinical forms, effusive FIP, in which effusion is observed in body cavities, and non-effusive FIP [1, 2] . Non-effusive FIP lacks specific clinical signs, with lesions presented mainly in the eyes, central nervous system (CNS), and parenchymatous organs. Clinical signs associated with CNS disease in cases of FIP are observed in about 10% of all FIP cases and 25-33% of non-effusive FIP cases [1, 2, 9] . Recently, image diagnosis is often performed especially for neurological instances in veterinary medical field, and CSF sample can be collected at that time. Detection of FCoV-specific antibody in CSF, which is produced by local replication of FCoV in brain tissue, is useful for the ante-mortem diagnosis of neurologic-form FIP [9] . Several studies have reported the anti-FCoV antibody titers in CSF, but the number of clinical cases reported is small, and no diagnostic index of FIP has been proposed [4, 10, 20] ."
High Rate of Viral Identification and Coinfections in Infants with Acute Bronchiolitis,OBJECTIVES: To determine the viruses and risk factors associated with hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in infants with acute bronchiolitis.,"Acute viral bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in infants worldwide. 1 Aside from the significant financial burden it causes in developed countries, 2 the condition is responsible for many deaths attributed to respiratory infections in developing nations. 3 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major etiological agent responsible for bronchiolitis and is identified in 70% of bronchiolitis cases during the fall and winter. 1 Parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus, and influenza are frequently described as occurring year-round. 4 The recent widespread use of molecular-based methods has yielded new insights about the etiology of bronchiolitis and has suggested a significant role for other viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, 5 rhinovirus, 6 and coronaviruses, in bronchiolitis. 7 Currently, controversy exists regarding whether the presence of these viruses increases the severity of RSV. Either way, the impact of coinfections, in general, is still unclear. [8] [9] [10] Recent studies examining the etiology of bronchiolitis in infants have reported high rates of viral detection. [10] [11] [12] However, these studies have been limited to hospitaladmitted patients, which may lead them to over-or underestimate the true significance of the roles that different viral etiologies may play in determining the severity of bronchiolitis."
,"A novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world. At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person. Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.","The emergence of a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV in Wuhan December 2019 has led to a global response to the first epidemic of this decade. It has also highlighted two key issues: First, China's rapid and efficient capacity to identify and investigate a newly emerging disease; and second, our continued global vulnerability to epidemics and pandemics. From the date of the first cluster of cases admitted to a local hospital on December 27, 2019, Chinese scientists identified this disease as a new syndrome, discovered the pathogen as the cause, and reported its genetic sequence to the world in less than 14 days [1, 2] . At the time of writing, we have detailed information on its relationship to other bat coronaviruses, many of which were discovered in a collaboration among EcoHealth Alliance, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and Duke NUS [3] . We also have data from experimental cell line infections [4] , on the clinical findings [5] , the epidemiology of viral transmission [6] , and on its spread to other countries. These rapid and successful results are a resounding endorsement of China's emergence as a 21st Century scientific superpower, and of a country with a modern and efficient public health system, technically supported by the China CDC with a system of Provincial and City CDCs that are trained in effective outbreak investigation and control [7] ."
Wobbling Forth and Drifting Back: The Evolutionary History and Impact of Bacterial tRNA Modifications,"Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific (""target"") tRNAs to recognize multiple codons and cover for other (""nontarget"") tRNAs, often improving translation efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in nontarget tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation.","Compared with the total complement of 61 sense codons, most bacterial genomes contain only 25-46 unique tRNA species (Grosjean et al. 2010 ). This apparent shortfall in decoding ability is mitigated by GU wobble base pairing that allows a single tRNA to decode non-complementary codons (Crick 1966) . Additionally, specific modifications to the first anticodon base of the tRNA also contribute to wobble base pairing, sometimes reducing translational errors (Yokoyama et al. 1985; Brierley et al. 1997; Marck and Grosjean 2002; N€ asvall et al. 2004 Agris et al. 2007; Björk and Hagervall 2014; Manickam et al. 2015) . Base modifications are carried out by several tRNA modifying enzyme (ME) pathways, that chemically modify the wobble position of a large fraction (42%) of all tRNA species (Grosjean et al. 2010; Machnicka et al. 2015; Boccaletto et al. 2018) . Given their potential impact on the effective tRNA pool and on translation dynamics, MEs should generally face strong selection, especially in species with a restricted tRNA repertoire. Indeed, in several bacteria, deleting MEs is lethal or otherwise deleterious for growth and translation (Wolf et al. 2002; Shippy et al. 2013; Björk and Hagervall 2014; Gao et al. 2016) . However, in some cases MEs do not appear to be essential (Noguchi et al. 1982) , suggesting strong yet variable evolutionary impacts of tRNA modifications. Recently, Novoa and colleagues showed that MEs unique to the three kingdoms of life have shaped kingdom-specific tRNA pools (Novoa et al. 2012) . However, the detailed evolutionary history of diverse bacterial tRNA modifications and their impact on key components of bacterial translation remain unclear."

Mortality rates for patients hospitalised with CAP approach 30%, especially in those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Diagnostic testing in CAP has the potential to improve individual patient management, reducing the risk of clinical failure and death, and to generate epidemiological data, informing the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. Unfortunately, these advantages are counterbalanced by high healthcare costs associated with diagnostic testing and low sensitivity of these tests to identify pathogens causing CAP [5, 6] ."
A Golgi Retention Signal in a Membrane-spanning Domain of Coronavirus El Protein,"The El glycoprotein from an avian coronavirus is a model protein for studying retention in the Golgi complex . In animal cells expressing the protein from cDNA, the El protein is targeted to cis Golgi cisternae (Machamer, C. E., S. A. Mentone, J. K. Rose, and M. G. Farquhar. 1990 . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:6944-6948) . We show that the first of the three membrane-spanning domains of the El protein can retain two different plasma membrane proteins in the Golgi region of transfected cells.

J MM A Flood of Health Functional Foods: What Is to Be Recommended?,"Health functional food is referred to a food prepared or processed from specific components or ingredients for functionality beneficial to the body through extraction, concentration, purification, blending and other methods. The demand for health functional foods is steadily increasing, and red ginseng is the most demanded food among women in the 50s, followed by multivitamin, omega-3, glucosamine and aloe. To date, there is insufficient evidence on the effect of red ginseng on exercise capacity, somatic symptom and cognitive performance in healthy individuals. Moreover, evidence is insufficient that a nutritional dose of vitamin or mineral reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer, or mortality rate. A steady intake of oily fish is recommended to prevent the incidence of cardiovascular disease for postmenopausal women. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is expected to prevent cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with almost no intake of oily fish and those not taking statins. It still remains controversial whether glucosamine is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Hence, physicians should fully inform patients with all controversial information about the effectiveness of glucosamine when prescribing glucosamine for patients with osteoarthritis. (J Menopausal Med 2015;21:12-18)","The term ""health functional food"" means food manufactured or processed in a form of tablet, capsule, powder, granule, liquid or pill, etc. with ingredients or components, that possess the functionality useful for human body in accordance with Article 3 of the Korean Health Functional Food Act.

Standards for Sequencing Viral Genomes in the Era of High- Throughput Sequencing,"Thanks to high-throughput sequencing technologies, genome sequencing has become a common component in nearly all aspects of viral research; thus, we are experiencing an explosion in both the number of available genome sequences and the number of institutions producing such data. However, there are currently no common standards used to convey the quality, and therefore utility, of these various genome sequences. Here, we propose five ""standard"" categories that encompass all stages of viral genome finishing, and we define them using simple criteria that are agnostic to the technology used for sequencing. We also provide genome finishing recommendations for various downstream applications, keeping in mind the cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with different levels of finishing. Our goal is to define a common vocabulary that will allow comparison of genome quality across different research groups, sequencing platforms, and assembly techniques.","V iruses represent the greatest source of biological diversity on Earth, and with the help of high-throughput (HT) sequencing technologies, great strides are being made toward the genomic characterization of this diversity (1) (2) (3) . Genome sequences play a critical role in our understanding of viral evolution, disease epidemiology, surveillance, diagnosis, and countermeasure development and thus represent valuable resources which must be properly documented and curated to ensure future utility. Here, we outline a set of viral genome quality standards, similar in concept to those proposed for large DNA genomes (4) but focused on the particular challenges of and needs for research on small RNA/ DNA viruses, including characterization of the genomic diversity inherent in all viral samples/populations.

Food/farmed animals,"The ability of the infectious bronchitis H120 (a Massachusetts strain) and CR88 (a 793B strain) live attenuated vaccine viruses to protect from two Middle East infectious bronchitis virus isolates, IS/885/00-like (IS/885) and IS/1494/06-like (IS/1494) in broiler chicks was investigated. Day-old chicks were separated into three groups, (I) vaccinated with H120 at day-old followed by CR88 at 14 days-old, (II) vaccinated with H120 and CR88 simultaneously at day-old and again with CR88 at 14 days-old, (III) control unvaccinated. At 30 days-old, each of the groups was challenged with virulent IS/885 or IS/1494. Protection was evaluated based on the clinical signs, tracheal and kidney gross lesions and tracheal ciliostasis. Results showed that administering combined live H120 and CR88 vaccines simultaneously at day-old followed by CR88 vaccine at 14 days-old gave more than 80 per cent tracheal ciliary protection from both of the Middle East isolates. In addition, this programme conferred 100 per cent protection from clinical signs and tracheal or kidney lesions. The other vaccination programme, H120 at day-old followed by CR88 at 14 days-old, the tracheal ciliary protection conferred were 60 per cent and 80 per cent from IS/885/00-like and IS/1494/06like, respectively. Awad F, et al. Vet Rec Open 2015;2:e000111.","Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a ubiquitous virus with high mutation, and a large number of serotypes or genotypes of IBV strains have been reported worldwide (de Wit and others 2011). Variant strains emerge due to changes in the IBV genome through point mutations, deletions, insertions or RNA recombination and these variants are often responsible for IB outbreaks in vaccinated chicken flocks (Cavanagh and others 1988 IS/885/00 and IS/1494/06 or those with high similarities to these strains of IBVs have been reported throughout the Middle East and North Africa (Meir and others 2004) , Iraq (Mahmood and others 2011) , Egypt (Abdel-Moneim and others 2012), Turkey (Kahya and others 2013) and Libya (Awad and others 2014a) . In most cases, severe respiratory distress and renal lesions with high mortality were observed in vaccinated flocks affected by these strains. It appears that the conventional H120 vaccines alone do not provide sufficient protection from these strains (Meir and others 2004, Kahya and others 2013) . However, development of vaccines against each of these new variants is not generally an option due to the high cost and time required for product registration (Jackwood and others 2003, Bijlenga and others 2004) . Furthermore, it could be a never-ending race as new variant IBVs are constantly emerging in major poultry producing countries. Instead, it has been recommended that protection conferred by available live IBV vaccines against new variants should be constantly evaluated (Alvarado and others 2003) . Vaccination with one serotype does not ensure complete protection from heterologous strains (Cook and others 1999) but the use of different combinations of live IBV vaccines has been shown to be able to induce high and broad protection from challenges with several heterologous virulent IBV variants (Gelb and others 1991 , Cook and others 1999 , Cook and others 2001 , Alvarado and others 2003 , Martin and others 2007 , Terregino and others 2008 ."
The activity of the HIV-1 IRES is stimulated by oxidative stress and controlled by a negative regulatory element,"Initiation of translation of the full-length messenger RNA of HIV-1, which generates the viral structural proteins and enzymes, is cap-dependent but can also use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5 0 untranslated region. Our aim was to define, through a mutational analysis, regions of HIV-1 IRES that are important for its activity. A dualluciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle.","Initiation of translation of most eukaryotic cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) occurs by a cap-dependent mechanism that requires ribosomal scanning of their 5 0 UTR. The 40S ribosomal subunit bearing the initiator tRNA, Met-tRNA Met i , interacts with the initiation factors bound at the cap (m 7 GpppG) at the 5 0 end of the mRNA, and then scans the mRNA in the 5 0 -3 0 direction until it encounters an initiation codon in an appropriate context. The 60S ribosomal subunit joins the 40S subunit and translation of the mRNA begins (1) (2) (3) . However, several groups of viruses and a minority of cellular mRNAs initiate translation in a cap-independent manner, using internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) (3, 4, (5) (6) (7) (8) . IRESes are structured RNA regions that are able to directly recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit at or near an initiation codon. This mode of initiation usually requires the participation of some canonical initiation factors and of host cell factors called IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). The structure, the molecular mechanism and the requirement for ITAFs of different IRESes vary greatly, reflecting their functional diversity (9) (10) (11) . IRESes were first discovered in picornaviruses (12, 13) , and have since been found in several other groups of viruses, including retroviruses (14) such as simian immunodeficiency virus (15, 16) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (17, 18) , human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (19, 20) , murine leukemia virus (21, 22) , Rous sarcoma virus (23) , feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) (24) and mouse mammary tumor virus (25) ."

MINI REVIEW ARTICLE Deciphering novel host-herpesvirus interactions by virion proteomics,"Over the years, a vast array of information concerning the interactions of viruses with their hosts has been collected. However, recent advances in proteomics and other system biology techniques suggest these interactions are far more complex than anticipated. One particularly interesting and novel aspect is the analysis of cellular proteins incorporated into mature virions. Though sometimes considered purification contaminants in the past, their repeated detection by different laboratories suggests that a number of these proteins are bona fide viral components, some of which likely contribute to the viral life cycles. The present mini review focuses on cellular proteins detected in herpesviruses. It highlights the common cellular functions of these proteins, their potential implications for host-pathogen interactions, discusses technical limitations, the need for complementing methods and probes potential future research avenues.","Over the last decades, many host-pathogen interactions have been characterized using genetics, biochemical, and microscopy approaches. These discoveries relied on mutants, pharmacological reagents, immunoprecipitations, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, cell fractionation, and Western blotting to name a few of the methods employed. These approaches provided much precious information but, given the typical focus of these approaches on individual molecules, likely only revealed a small portion of the proteins involved. Other methods such as high throughput two-hybrid and genetic screens, nucleic acid arrays, RNA interference, and proteomics are now proving essential tools to tackle the complexity of these interactions. The main advantages of mass spectrometry, for instance, are that it is a fast, sensitive and potentially a quantitative approach to identify putative novel players, particularly when coupled to efficient purification schemes. Already, proteomics revealed how viruses modulate the expression of host proteins (Rassmann et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2008; Antrobus et al., 2009; Pastorino et al., 2009; Thanthrige-Don et al., 2009; Zandi et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009 Zhang et al., , 2010 Coombs et al., 2010; Emmott et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2010 Lu et al., , 2012 Munday et al., 2010; Bartel et al., 2011; Lietzen et al., 2011; Ramirez-Boo et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2012) . A relatively new and interesting field is the characterization of host-pathogen interactions within mature purified virions. As reviewed on several occasions, several studies reported the presence of individual cellular proteins in viral particles (Bernhard et al., 2005; Maxwell and Frappier, 2007; Viswanathan and Fruh, 2007; Friedel and Haas, 2011; Zheng et al., 2011) . This includes vaccinia virus (Krauss et al., 2002) , influenza virus (Shaw et al., 2008) , HIV (Gurer et al., 2002; Cantin et al., 2005; Ott, 2008) , vesicular stomatitis virus (Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al., 2009) , and several herpesviruses (see below). Though these cellular components have often been considered purification contaminants, the presence of similar proteins in both related and unrelated viruses suggests that some of them may be biologically relevant. The identification of virion-associated host proteins could thus lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic tools against viruses. The present review focuses on their identification and putative roles with respect to the proteomics of herpesviruses."
Title: Household Emergency Preparedness in China: a Cross-sectional Survey Author names and affiliations,Word count: Main Text word count: 3393;,"Strengthening emergency responses can effectively reduce human casualties and contribute to sustainable post-event development. It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan. 4 Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management. This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities. 5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay. 6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical. 7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death. 8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events. 9 The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) defined preparedness as the ""knowledge, capacities and actions to effectively respond to the effects of hazard events, whether or not they have occurred"". 10 Preparedness activities can be developed at the individual, household, community and governmental levels. Household preparedness plays a critical role because it is an integral part of any individual and community effort. Household emergency preparedness requires stockpiling emergency supplies, planning for emergency events and other actions like buying accident insurance. [11] [12] Previous studies revealed poor household preparedness for disastrous events across a range of different settings. [13] [14] Despite a rise in the number of publications on household preparedness in developed countries, there is a serious shortage of literature documenting the situation in developing countries."
Vaccines for emerging pathogens: prospects for licensure,"Globally, there are a number of emerging pathogens. For most, there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development. However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge. Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro-organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential. Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease.","Globally, there are a number of emerging and re-emerging pathogens.

A Simple Method to Detect Candidate Overlapping Genes in Viruses Using Single Genome Sequences,"Overlapping genes in viruses maximize the coding capacity of their genomes and allow the generation of new genes without major increases in genome size. Despite their importance, the evolution and function of overlapping genes are often not well understood, in part due to difficulties in their detection. In addition, most bioinformatic approaches for the detection of overlapping genes require the comparison of multiple genome sequences that may not be available in metagenomic surveys of virus biodiversity. We introduce a simple new method for identifying candidate functional overlapping genes using single virus genome sequences. Our method uses randomization tests to estimate the expected length of open reading frames and then identifies overlapping open reading frames that significantly exceed this length and are thus predicted to be functional. We applied this method to 2548 reference RNA virus genomes and find that it has both high sensitivity and low false discovery for genes that overlap by at least 50 nucleotides. Notably, this analysis provided evidence for 29 previously undiscovered functional overlapping genes, some of which are coded in the antisense direction suggesting there are limitations in our current understanding of RNA virus replication.","Gene overlap occurs when two or more genes share the same region of a nucleotide sequence in a genome. This occurs frequently in viruses, especially those with RNA genomes, but has also been observed in bacteria and in eukaryotes including humans (Smith et al. 1977; Keese and Gibbs 1992; Veeramachaneni et al. 2004; Nakayama et al. 2007 ). The high prevalence of gene overlap in viruses has been attributed to two complementary theories: gene ""compression"" and gene ""novelty."" Compression theory argues that the size of viral genomes is constrained by factors such as high mutation rates and the small capsid structure housing the genetic material. This constrained genome size subsequently exerts selection pressure on genes to overlap to maximize genetic potential (Belshaw et al. 2007; Chirico et al. 2010) . Gene novelty theory asserts that the constrained nature of viral genomes, combined with their limited noncoding regions, makes the generation of new genes difficult without major changes in genomic structure or input from the host genome. Mutations in current genes that generate a new open reading frame (ORF) then allow the generation of new genes within an established older gene in a process called ""overprinting"" (Keese and Gibbs 1992; Sabath et al. 2012; Brandes and Linial 2016) . These theories are not mutually exclusive and both processes may be operating in virus genomes. Overlapping genes may also function as a mechanism for regulating gene expression and reduce the probability of mutation fixation in overlapping areas as the resident genes may have competing selection pressures (Krakauer 2000; Dreher and Miller 2006) . Due to these evolutionary constraints, overlapping genes frequently encode proteins with accessory functions that play important roles in pathogenicity or spread (Rancurel et al. 2009 )."
Antioxidant effect of angiotensin (1-7) in the protection of pancreatic β cell function,"It is well known that the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in the diabetic state, which results in an increase in the level of oxidative stress injury to pancreatic β cells. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)]/Mas axis is a negative regulator of the classical renin-angiotensin system. In order to investigate the antioxidant effect of Ang (1-7) on pancreatic β cells, INS-1 cells were cultured and oxidative stress was induced by treatment with H 2 O 2 . Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and glucose-stimulated calcium (GSCa) responses in β cells were determined following treatment with Ang (1-7) . It was observed that H 2 O 2 significantly impaired the insulin secreting function, increased the production of ROS, and also decreased the levels of GSCa and MMP. Pre-treatment with Ang (1-7) alleviated these effects and treatment with A779 [antagonist of Ang (1-7)] prevented the effects of Ang (1-7). Based on these findings, it was concluded that Ang (1-7) can protect pancreatic β cells from oxidative injury and such protection can be blocked by its antagonist A779.","Diabetes is a chronic metabolic syndrome caused by insulin deficiency and resistance. There are 200 million diabetic individuals in the world, with only approximately one-half being diagnosed, and these numbers are expected to double by 2030. The disease often results in long-term microvascular, neurological, and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Excessive activation of angiotensin II (AngII) is an important underlying mechanism for the development of diabetes, and Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) is hypothesized to counteract it. Furthermore, the reninangiotensin system (RAS) is significantly involved in the development of diabetes and its complications. The activation of RAS causes pancreatic β cell dysfunction by suppressing pro-insulin biosynthesis, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and first phase insulin secretion (1) (2) , as well as by increasing islet fibrosis (3) and oxidative stress (4) . The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-angiotensin (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) [Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) ]-Mas axis is suggested to have an antagonistic effect on the RAS, while Ang (1-7) is the main antagonist of AngII. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) can alleviate these pathological changes (3, (5) (6) (7) . Also, several clinical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAS blockade in reducing the onset of diabetes (8) (9) (10) (11) ."

Z-stacks were analyzed with Imaris (Bitplane) using the ImarisCell analysis module to quantify number and intensity of IFITM2/3 and LAMP-1+ vesicles. Statistical analysis of vesicle quantity and staining intensity was conducted using Prism 7 (GraphPad) and evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis test using Dunn's multiple comparison correction."
Expression and role of HEPIS in breast cancer,"Human embryo lung cellular protein interacting with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus nonstructural protein-10 (HEPIS) is expressed at varying levels in multiple organs and breast cancer cell lines. However, its expression and function in breast cancer cells has yet to be studied. Therefore, RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of HEPIS in breast cancer and cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue. HEPIS was expressed at lower levels in breast cancer compared with that in adjacent normal tissue. Subcellular localization of HEPIS was mainly found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine cell proliferation assays were used to investigate the role of HEPIS in cancer cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of HEPIS in MCF-7 cells was found to significantly inhibit cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of HEPIS by RNA interference exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed and HEPIS overexpression specifically inhibited the activity of the NF-κB reporter gene. Results of the gene chip assay revealed that 2,231 genes were differentially expressed in HEPIS-overexpressing cells. Results of the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were enriched in the 'mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway', 'JAK-STAT signaling pathway' and 'focal adhesion'. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to confirm the expression levels of the differentially expressed genes interleukin 2 receptor subunit α (IL2RA), interferon α and β receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and IFα8 (IFNA8). In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that HEPIS may function as a potential repressor of breast cancer.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus nonstructural protein-10 (SARS-CoV nsp-10) is the main transcriptase of SARS that cleaves polyproteins orf1a (187-260 kDa) and orf1b (345-422 kDa) during infection (1) . Human embryo lung cellular protein interacting with SARS-CoV nsp-10 (HEPIS) is a novel gene that was previously isolated from a cDNA library of human embryonic lung tissue and the protein it encodes interacts with SARS-CoV nsp10 (2) . The HEPIS gene is expressed as two different isoforms, isoform A and isoform B, which are 220 and 147 amino acids long, respectively (2, 3) . Previously, it was demonstrated that HEPIS is differentially expressed in ten different types of cancer, including stomach, liver, and prostate cancer (4) . Furthermore, the transcription factors Oct-1, NF-κB and C-Jun are associated with transcriptional regulation of the HEPIS gene (4) . Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide (5, 6) , with the incidence of 92.8 per 100,000 women in western Europe in 2018 (7) . Breast cancer progression is a complex process comprising cell cycle dysregulation (8) and metastasis to distant organs (9) . A variety of steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone (10) , and the expression of specific genes, such as zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 and matrix metallopeptidases (9) , have been attributed to the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells. A previous study showed that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 regulates the expression of the p21 and CDK4 genes to promote breast cancer cell proliferation (11) . Bone morphogenetic protein 6 has been found to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by targeting microRNA-192 and its direct target RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (12) . Clinically, therapeutic interventions for the growth and metastasis of breast cancer remain limited. Our previous study demonstrated that the expression of HEPIS was significantly higher in T-47D compared with ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (4) . However, the function of HEPIS in breast cancer cell proliferation has not yet been elucidated, and the elucidation of such a mechanism may provide novel approaches for therapy."

Chyloabdomen in a cat with pancreatic carcinoma,"A 12-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat was evaluated for a 3-week history of abdominal distension. Chyloabdomen secondary to pancreatic carcinoma was diagnosed. The cat was palliatively managed using rutin and a low-fat diet. The etiology, diagnosis and management of chyloabdomen are discussed.","In human and veterinary medicine, chyloabdomen is a rare condition. It results from leakage of lipid-rich lymph into the peritoneal cavity, secondarily to obstruction or increased permeability of lymphatic vessels. In cats, it is believed to be mostly of neoplastic origin. Medical investigation relies on a systematic approach and definitive diagnosis often requires histopathological samples. This report describes the exploration and management of a chyloabdomen secondary to pancreatic carcinoma in a 12-year-old cat."
,"Emodin-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro has been gaining increasing attention. However, the exact molecular pathways underlying these effects remain poorly clarified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose-and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). However, the protein expression of Bcl-2, cyclin A and CDK2 was downregulated. Taken together, our results suggest that emodin induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through cell cycle arrest and ROS generation in HepaRG cells.","Apoptosis is a highly regulated and genetically programmed cell death process. It is driven through the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway (1) (2) (3) , which plays a pivotal role in the programmed cell death of mammalian cells (4) . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in apoptosis by regulating the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (5) . An increase in ROS production regulates Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bcl-2. Changes in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio result in the release cytochrome c, which then activates caspase-3 and cleaves PARP, leading to cell death through the mitochondrial death pathway (6) (7) (8) ."
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Extreme water-related weather events and waterborne disease,"Global climate change is expected to affect the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme water-related weather events such as excessive precipitation, floods, and drought. We conducted a systematic review to examine waterborne outbreaks following such events and explored their distribution between the different types of extreme water-related weather events. Four medical and meteorological databases (Medline, Embase, GeoRef, PubMed) and a global electronic reporting system (ProMED) were searched, from 1910 to 2010. Eighty-seven waterborne outbreaks involving extreme water-related weather events were identified and included, alongside 235 ProMED reports. Heavy rainfall and flooding were the most common events preceding outbreaks associated with extreme weather and were reported in 55 . 2 % and 52 . 9% of accounts, respectively. The most common pathogens reported in these outbreaks were Vibrio spp. (21 . 6%) and Leptospira spp. (12 . 7 %). Outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events were often the result of contamination of the drinking-water supply (53 . 7 %). Differences in reporting of outbreaks were seen between the scientific literature and ProMED. Extreme water-related weather events represent a risk to public health in both developed and developing countries, but impact will be disproportionate and likely to compound existing health disparities.","Global climate change is expected to affect the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme waterrelated weather events such as excessive rainfall, storm surges, floods, and drought [1] [2] [3] . Recent extreme water-related weather events have included drought in Russia and flooding in Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Australia and Brazil. Weather is expected to become more extreme and variable due to acceleration of the water cycle caused by atmospheric heating. Altered pressure and temperature patterns, caused by global warming, may also shift the distribution of when and where extreme water-related events usually occur [4] . . The frequency of heavy precipitation events is thought to have increased over many mid-latitude regions since 1950, even where there has been a reduction in the total precipitation. The area affected by drought is thought to have increased since the 1970s in many areas of the world [4] . There is also evidence to suggest that other extreme water-related weather events such as El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), hurricanes, and cyclones are becoming more frequent, intense and of greater duration [4, 5] ."
Proteomics Analysis of the Nucleolus in Adenovirus-infected Cells □ S,"Adenoviruses replicate primarily in the host cell nucleus, and it is well established that adenovirus infection affects the structure and function of host cell nucleoli in addition to coding for a number of nucleolar targeted viral proteins. Here we used unbiased proteomics methods, including high throughput mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition of the nucleolus during adenovirus infection. Twodimensional gel analysis revealed changes in six proteins.","nucleus are inhibited, and a number of viral nucleolar antigens accumulate in the nucleoli of infected cells (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Moreover, two cellular nucleolar antigens, UBF 1 and B23.1, have been shown to be sequestered into viral DNA replication centers where they affect viral DNA replication (11) (12) (13) . Thus, there is clear evidence that adenovirus infection has a substantial impact on the composition and function of the nucleolus. What is not clear is whether the sequestration of cellular nucleolar antigens is limited to a small number of proteins or widespread. In addition, it is unclear whether adenovirus primarily modulates the nucleolus for replicative advantage or whether the effects on the nucleolus are a side effect of cellular proteins being sequestered into virally induced structures."
Preventive Effect of Korean Red Ginseng for Acute Respiratory Illness: A Randomized and Double-Blind Clinical Trial,"Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) is a functional food and has been well known for keeping good health due to its anti-fatigue and immunomodulating activities. However, there is no data on Korean red ginseng for its preventive activity against acute respiratory illness (ARI). The study was conducted in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers (Clinical Trial Number: NCT01478009). Our primary efficacy end point was the number of ARI reported and secondary efficacy end point was severity of symptoms, number of symptoms, and duration of ARI. A total of 100 volunteers were enrolled in the study. Fewer subjects in the KRG group reported contracting at least 1 ARI than in the placebo group (12 [24.5%] vs 22 [44.9%], P = 0.034), the difference was statistically significant between the two groups. The symptom duration of the subjects who experienced the ARI, was similar between the two groups (KRG vs placebo; 5.2 ± 2.3 vs 6.3 ± 5.0, P = 0.475). The symptom scores were low tendency in KRG group (KRG vs placebo; 9.5 ± 4.5 vs 17.6 ± 23.1, P = 0.241). The study suggests that KRG may be effective in protecting subjects from contracting ARI, and may have the tendency to decrease the duration and scores of ARI symptoms.","Acute respiratory illness (ARI) is a self-limiting viral disease that causes mild symptoms such as fever, shivering, chills, malaise, and dry cough. Rhinovirus and coronavirus (50%-70%) are the most common viruses, followed by influenza virus (20%-35%), and adenovirus (5%-10%) (1, 2) . Most influenza-associated deaths occur in persons aged 65 yr or older with associated chronic disease (3) . Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for elderly persons who are at an increased risk for severe complications from influenza (4) ."
Structural Factors of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak as a Public Health Crisis in Korea and Future Response Strategies,"The recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak has originated from a failure in the national quarantine system in the Republic of Korea as most basic role of protecting the safety and lives of its citizens. Furthermore, a number of the Korean healthcare system's weaknesses seem to have been completely exposed. The MERS-CoV outbreak can be considered a typical public health crisis in that the public was not only greatly terrorized by the actual fear of the disease, but also experienced a great impact to their daily lives, all in a short period of time. Preparedness for and an appropriate response to a public health crisis require comprehensive systematic public healthcare measures to address risks comprehensively with an all-hazards approach. Consequently, discussion regarding establishment of post-MERS-CoV improvement measures must focus on the total reform of the national quarantine system and strengthening of the public health infrastructure. In addition, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must implement specific strategies of action including taking on the role of ""control tower"" in a public health emergency, training of Field Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, establishment of collaborative governance between central and local governments for infection prevention and control, strengthening the roles and capabilities of community-based public hospitals, and development of nationwide crisis communication methods.","From the occurrence of the index case on May 11, 2015 and the final (186th) patient on July 4, to the announcement by the public health authorities on July 28 that no risk of infection remained, the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona- virus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in South Korea (hereafter Korea) has been the largest mass outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula, after its first report in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1] . Up to the present, the reports of MERS-CoV in other countries such as the US, Canada, Britain, and Southeast Asia has involved fewer than 5 cases in each country, and large-scale transmission has not occurred [2] . On the other hand, the fact that a large number of MERS-CoV cases arose in a short period of time in Korea, where the camels that serve as the host of MERS-CoV do not live, and that its mass outbreak led to a public health crisis suggests the possible existence of structural flaws in the Korean healthcare system."
Clinicopathologic Features and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in 24 Cats With Histopathologically Confirmed Neurologic Feline Infectious Peritonitis,"Background: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most common infectious central nervous system (CNS) disease in the cat and is invariably fatal. Improved means of antemortem diagnosis is required to facilitate clinical decision making. Information regarding the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of neurologic FIP currently is limited, resulting in the need for better descriptions to optimize its use as a diagnostic tool.","F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most common infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in cats, typically affecting animals <3 years of age from multicat environments. [1] [2] [3] [4] Although the pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood, the causative agent, FIP virus (FIPV), is a monocyte/ macrophage-tropic mutant of the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). 5, 6 Virus-laden macrophages trigger a marked inflammatory reaction, resulting in multisystemic pyogranulomatous vasculitis. With time, the histiocytic population is replaced by a lymphoplasmacytic population. Two forms of the disease are recognized, the effusive or ""wet"" form, associated with serous exudates into the abdominal cavity, and the noneffusive or ""dry"" form, associated with granulomatous parenchymal lesions. 7 Approximately 38% of cases with the noneffusive form and 5% of cases with the effusive form of FIP are presented with involvement of the CNS, in which typical neurologic deficits are reported, including seizures, ataxia, and head tilt. 4, 5, 7, 8 The inevitable mortality of CNS FIP necessitates prompt diagnosis to avoid prolonged efforts at unsuccessful treatment and inappropriate client expectations. However, antemortem definitive diagnosis of the disease remains challenging because FIPV is serologically and genetically indistinguishable from FECV, and hence, further diagnostic tools are needed. 1 Within the CNS, FIPV-induced pyogranulomatous vasculitis predominantly affects the leptomeninges, ependyma, and choroid plexuses. 2, 5, 6, 9 Such lesions would be expected to generate distinctive changes on MRI of the CNS. The MRI findings in 4 cats with neurologic FIP were previously reported. 5 Ventricular dilatation was detected in 3 cats, with periventricular contrast enhancement in all cats in which contrast agents were administered. In a subsequent study, 8 cats with histologically confirmed neurologic FIP and MRI were reported. 10 In 3 cases, MRI was reported to be normal. In the remaining 5 cases, abnormalities included cerebellar herniation (3), ventricular dilatation (4) , and meningeal and ependymal contrast enhancement (5) . Therefore, although MRI abnormalities have been documented in cats with neurologic FIP, case numbers are limited. Furthermore, advances in MRI technology and availability since these prior publications have made it an increasingly sensitive and accessible diagnostic tool. The aim of our study was to collate a larger number of cases to further evaluate neurologic FIP, with particular emphasis on assessing and comparing the clinical presentation with the MRI features and pathologic lesions."
Genomics and Public Health Research: Can the State Allow Access to Genomic Databases?,"Because many diseases are multifactorial disorders, the scientific progress in genomics and genetics should be taken into consideration in public health research. In this context, genomic databases will constitute an important source of information. Consequently, it is important to identify and characterize the State's role and authority on matters related to public health, in order to verify whether it has access to such databases while engaging in public health genomic research. We first consider the evolution of the concept of public health, as well as its core functions, using a comparative approach (e.g. WHO, PAHO, CDC and the Canadian province of Quebec). Following an analysis of relevant Quebec legislation, the precautionary principle is examined as a possible avenue to justify State access to and use of genomic databases for research purposes. Finally, we consider the Influenza pandemic plans developed by WHO, Canada, and Quebec, as examples of key tools framing public health decision-making process. We observed that State powers in public health, are not, in Quebec, well adapted to the expansion of genomics research. We propose that the scope of the concept of research in public health should be clear and include the following characteristics: a commitment to the health and well-being of the population and to their determinants; the inclusion of both applied research and basic research; and, an appropriate model of governance (authorization, follow-up, consent, etc.). We also suggest that the strategic approach version of the precautionary principle could guide collective choices in these matters.","""During the past century, achievements in public health have led to enormous improvements and benefits in the health and life expectancy of people around the world"" (1). However, even now, at the dawn of the XXI st century, public health still faces important challenges. New zoonoses such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (2) or West Nile Virus (WNV) (3) as well as new infectious diseases such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (4) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (5) come easily to mind and provide good examples. Moreover, the continuing and growing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes also merits considerable attention. Because many of these diseases are multifactorial disorders, the scientific progress in genomics and genetics must be taken into consideration in public health research (1, 6) This approach, integration of genomics into public health, requires that we: ""assess […] the impact of genes and their interaction with behaviour, diet, and the environment on the population's health. The promise of public health genomics is to have practitioners and researchers accumulating data on the relationships between genetic traits and diseases across populations, to use this information to develop strategies to promote health and prevent disease in populations, and to more precisely target and evaluate population-based interventions"" (7) . In short, ""public health genomics uses population based data on genetic variation and geneenvironment interactions to develop evidencebased tools for improving health and preventing disease"" (8) . Thus, genomic databases will constitute an important source of information, on the one hand, in order to pursue research aiming to understand better the genetic susceptibility to a disease regarding certain individuals within a population, and on the other, to implement eventually public health interventions. Consequently, from this viewpoint, it is important to identify and characterize the state's role and authority on matters related to public health, in order to verify whether it has access to such databases while engaging in public health genomic 1 (9) research. Then, is the mandate of our public health authorities adapted to the actual expansion of the genomic research domain? To answer this question, we first examine the evolution of the concept of public health, as well as its core functions, using a comparative approach (e.g. WHO, PAHO, CDC, and the Canadian province of Quebec) 2 . Following an overview of the essential roles of public health and an analysis of relevant Quebec legislation, the precautionary principle is examined as another possible avenue to justify State access to and use of genomic databases for research purposes or, for the management of a pandemic. Finally, we consider the Influenza pandemic plans developed by WHO, Canada, and Quebec, which are key tools framing public health decision-making. They 1 Public health genomics is defined as : ""the responsible and effective translation of genome-based and technologies into public policies, programs and services for the benefit of population"". 2 Quebec is one of the ten Canadian provinces. Canada is a federal state where Health is a shared jurisdiction. In Public Health matters, both the federal and provincial levels have some competencies. could illustrate the first steps in the evolutionary inclusion of genomics into public health. We think that this paper could help countries to examine their own definitions and legislations of public health to see if they contain provision that could form the foundation of the state powers to access genomic databases."
Unifying evolutionary and thermodynamic information for RNA folding of multiple alignments,"Computational methods for determining the secondary structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding, compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.","With the recent focus on nonprotein coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, interest in detecting novel ncRNAs has rapidly emerged. Since the structure of RNA is evolutionarily more conserved than its sequence, predicting the RNA's secondary structure is one of the most important steps towards its functional analysis. There are two fundamentally different approaches to predicting RNA secondary structures, namely free-energy minimization and probabilistic approaches, which often use phylogenetic information given by a multiple sequence alignment. This duality of approaches represents two different types of RNA structure information, the former relies on the physical properties of single sequences, while the latter uses evolutionary information in the form of compensatory base pair substitutions."
Travellers and influenza: risks and prevention,"Background: Influenza viruses are among the major causes of serious human respiratory tract infection worldwide. In line with the high disease burden attributable to influenza, these viruses play an important, but often neglected, role in travel medicine. Guidelines and recommendations regarding prevention and management of influenza in travellers are scarce. Of special interest for travel medicine are risk populations and also circumstances that facilitate influenza virus transmission and spread, like travel by airplane or cruise ship and mass gatherings. Methods: We conducted a PUBMED/MEDLINE search for a combination of the MeSH terms Influenza virus, travel, mass gathering, large scale events and cruise ship. In addition we gathered guidelines and recommendations from selected countries and regarding influenza prevention and management in travellers. By reviewing these search results in the light of published knowledge in the fields of influenza prevention and management, we present best practice advice for the prevention and management of influenza in travel medicine. Results: Seasonal influenza is among the most prevalent infectious diseases in travellers. Known host-associated risk factors include extremes of age and being immune-compromised, while the most relevant environmental factors are associated with holiday cruises and mass gatherings. Conclusions: Pre-travel advice should address influenza and its prevention for travellers, whenever appropriate on the basis of the epidemiological situation concerned. Preventative measures should be strongly recommended for travellers at high-risk for developing complications. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination should be considered for any traveller wishing to reduce the risk of incapacitation, particularly cruise ship crew and passengers, as well as those participating in mass gatherings. Besides advice concerning preventive measures and vaccination, advice on the use of antivirals may be considered for some travellers.","Influenza viruses, members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, are among the most diverse emerging infectious agents and cause predominantly respiratory disease in humans. Of the three influenza virus types (A, B and C), influenza A is the best known for its ability to drift, re-assort and cause yearly seasonal outbreaks in the temperate regions of the world. There are three presentations of human influenza: seasonal, avian and pandemic. Seasonal influenza is caused by influenza A or B viruses and affects 5-15% of the human population every year. 1 Symptoms vary from mild respiratory complaints to fatal respiratory distress syndrome, while subclinical infections may also occur. Severity of infection and outcome of disease depend largely on the influenza virus involved and the immune and health status of the infected individual. Most seasonal influenza virus infections are self-limiting and patients do not need to seek medical care. However, in most years, seasonal influenza does cause a considerable burden of disease, especially in individuals at high-risk for complications. 2 Sporadic infections of humans with avian influenza A viruses may occur causing serious and even fatal disease, but these viruses are not efficiently transmitted among humans. However, an avian virus that, by mutation and/or re-assortment, acquires the capacity to be transmitted efficiently from humanto-human, could be the basis of an emerging pandemic. Four major influenza pandemics have occurred in the past century: in 1918-1920 (Spanish Flu), 1957-1958 (Asian Flu), 1968 -1970 and recently in 2009-2010 (Mexican or 'swine' Flu). Some avian strains pathogenic to humans may be directly transmitted from birds to humans and may also adapt to humanto-human transmissibility by mutation or re-assortment, 3 ,4 avian influenza viruses should be considered a major global health threat. 5 Several reviews have recently addressed influenza virus epidemiology, high-risk groups, vaccination strategies, and treatments. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] However, one fast-growing risk group-travellersis largely missing from these overviews. Several changes in our globalizing world contribute to the growing importance of this group: (i) steady increase in total travel volume worldwide, (ii) advent of mass-tourism and (iii) increasing numbers of immunecompromised and elderly travellers. These changes highlight the importance of harmonized international and national guidelines for influenza prevention and treatment in travel medicine. For example, it is easy to imagine how large pan-national religious gatherings like the Hajj and Umrah, or international sporting events and festivals could facilitate global spread of influenza. Modern means of transport that gather large numbers of people in relatively small spaces, like cruise ships and airplanes or airports, may also require special attention from a public health perspective. Herein, we summarize existing guidelines and discuss recommendations dealing with the prevention and management of influenza from a traveller's perspective including the use of vaccines and antivirals as well as hygienic and societal measures. Special attention is given to implications of air and cruise-ship travel, travel to tropical regions and between hemispheres, mass gatherings, necessary actions and directions for future research."
Structural basis for the regulatory function of a complex zinc-binding domain in a replicative arterivirus helicase resembling a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay helicase,"All positive-stranded RNA viruses with genomes >$7 kb encode helicases, which generally are poorly characterized. The core of the nidovirus superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1) is associated with a unique N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD) that was previously implicated in helicase regulation, genome replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The high-resolution structure of the arterivirus helicase (nsp10), alone and in complex with a polynucleotide substrate, now provides first insights into the structural basis for nidovirus helicase function. A previously uncharacterized domain 1B connects HEL1 domains 1A and 2A to a long linker of ZBD, which further consists of a novel RING-like module and treble-clef zinc finger, together coordinating three Zn atoms. On substrate binding, major conformational changes were evident outside the HEL1 domains, notably in domain 1B. Structural characterization, mutagenesis and biochemistry revealed that helicase activity depends on the extensive relay of interactions between the ZBD and HEL1 domains. The arterivirus helicase structurally resembles the cellular Upf1 helicase, suggesting that nidoviruses may also use their helicases for post-transcriptional quality control of their large RNA genomes.","Helicases and nucleic acid translocases are ATP-dependent motor proteins capable of moving along their nucleic acid substrates while either unwinding duplexed regions (helicases) or performing other functions (translocases), including protein displacement and the nucleation of larger RNA-protein complexes (1, 2) . These enzymes are known to be critical players in a wide variety of biological processes and are encoded by all organisms, as well as positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses with genomes larger than about 7 kb [(3); for reviews, see (4) (5) (6) ]. On the basis of sequence comparisons, helicases/translocases have been classified into six superfamilies (SF1 to SF6) (7, 8) , with +RNA viral helicases belonging to SF1, SF2 or SF3. Based on the direction of translocation, helicases of various superfamilies have been divided into (biochemical) classes A and B, which translocate along their nucleic acid substrates in the 3 0 -5 0 or 5 0 -3 0 direction, respectively (7) . In the case of SF1 helicases (9, 10) , structurally characterized cellular enzymes of class B (SF1B) are further divided into the phylogenetically compact Pif1-like (Pif1, RecD2), UvrD/Rep and Upf1-like (Upf1, Ighmbp2) groups, with the latter being able to unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes (11) ."
Anti-foot-and-mouth disease virus effects of Chinese herbal kombucha in vivo,"The foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) is sensitive to acids and can be inactivated by exposure to low pH conditions. Spraying animals at risk of infection with suspensions of acid-forming microorganisms has been identified as a potential strategy for preventing FMD. Kombucha is one of the most strongly acid-forming symbiotic probiotics and could thus be an effective agent with which to implement this strategy. Moreover, certain Chinese herbal extracts are known to have broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Chinese herbal kombucha can be prepared by fermenting Chinese herbal extracts with a kombucha culture. Previous studies demonstrated that Chinese herbal kombucha prepared in this way efficiently inhibits FMDV replication in vitro. To assess the inhibitory effects of Chinese herbal kombucha against FMDV in vitro, swine challenged by intramuscular injection with 1000 SID 50 of swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99 after treatment with Chinese herbal kombucha were partially protected against infection, as demonstrated by a lack of clinical symptoms and qRT-PCR analysis. In a large scale field trial, spraying cattle in an FMD outbreak zone with kombucha protected against infection. Chinese herbal kombucha may be a useful probiotic agent for managing FMD outbreaks.","Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infects cloven-hoofed animals and has had devastating consequences in many countries (Gibbens et al., 2001; Grubman et al., 2004; Knowles et al., 2001) . Two strategies for its prevention and eradication have been widely adopted. Mass slaughter of animals at risk of infection has been used extensively in developed countries but economic factors have made vaccination more popular in developing countries where the prevalence of FMD is high (Li et al., 2010) . Most countries in the European Union and North America have controlled the disease by slaughtering infected animals and those that may have been exposed, but it remains endemic in many African, Asian, and South American countries (Bayry et al., 2001) . Although the slaughter policy has been highly successful in limiting the extent of outbreaks and eliminating the infection, it has important negative aspects."
Cyclophilin A as a target in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infections,"Background: Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on the cellular machinery of the host to regenerate and manufacture their proteins. Most antiviral drugs on the market today target viral proteins. However, the more recent strategies involve targeting the host cell proteins or pathways that mediate viral replication. This new approach would be effective for most viruses while minimizing drug resistance and toxicity. Methods: Cytomegalovirus replication, latency, and immune response are mediated by the intermediate early protein 2, the main protein that determines the effectiveness of drugs in cytomegalovirus inhibition. This review explains how intermediate early protein 2 can modify the action of cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive, and antiviral drug. It also links all the pathways mediated by cyclosporin A, cytomegalovirus replication, and its encoded proteins. Results: Intermediate early protein 2 can influence the cellular cyclophilin A pathway, affecting cyclosporin A as a mediator of viral replication or anti-cytomegalovirus drug. Conclusion: Cyclosporin A has a dual function in cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. It has the immunosuppressive effect that establishes virus replication through the inhibition of T-cell function. It also has an anti-cytomegalovirus effect mediated by intermediate early protein 2. Both of these functions involve cyclophilin A pathway.","Viruses, without their own replication machinery, depend on the host cell to proliferate. The viruses interact with host cells, activates enzymes and co-factors required for their replication. The response of the host cell thus reflects the pathogenic properties of the virus. 1, 2 In the treatment of viral diseases, the drugs primarily target special viral proteins. Current antiviral drugs include nucleotide analogs, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] neuraminidase enzyme and M2 channel, 8, 9 reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors, 10, 11 and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist. 12 Many drugs targeting viral proteins are fraught with cytotoxicity and tend to cause drug resistance. 13 Although drugs that target cellular factors or pathways have the advantage of overcoming cellular barriers, their toxicities compromise their usefulness. [14] [15] [16] [17] For this reason, there is a need to discover alternative antiviral compounds with minimal side effects. 18 Immunosuppressed patients undergoing organ transplantation are susceptible to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that could cause rejections. [19] [20] [21] Interestingly, two immunosuppressive drugs, mycophenolic acid and mizoribine, 22 have better anti-CMV activities than ganciclovir [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and allow for good graft survival. [28] [29] [30] Some immunosuppressive drugs were developed to target specific protein kinases essential for virus replication. Among these are artesunate, a drug that inhibits cellular kinase signalling, NF-jB, and Sp1 proteins, 31, 32 and sirolimus and everolimus, rapamycin inhibitors targeting cellular signals. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] These drugs were shown to be active against ganciclovir-and foscarnet-resistant CMV strains. 38, 39 This review discusses the association between cellular pathways mediated by CMV and cyclosporin A (CsA) and demonstrates that CsA can be used both as an immunosuppressive drug in organ transplantation and as an anti-CMV agent."
Epidemiological and clinical evaluation of children with respira- tory virus infections,Background: Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of respiratory tract infections among children and are responsible for causing morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study was performed to detect viruses in children with respiratory infections and describe their epidemiology and clinical characteristics.,"Among children, respiratory tract infections (RTI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide especially in developing countries (1, 2) . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV) and the recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV) likely account for a majority of respiratory tract illnesses (3) . The most prevalent presentations in RTI include sore throat, headache and my-algia (4) . Studies assessing the relationship between clinical symptoms and respiratory infections yielded conflicting results (5) . In temperate climate regions, RTI display a defined seasonality occurring mainly during the winter (2) ."
Brief Communication,Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is found to cause a large outbreak started from Wuhan since December 2019 in China and SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with epidemiological linkage to China in 25 countries until now. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the oropharyngeal sample obtained from the patient with the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea. Cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vero cell cultures were confluent 3 days after the first blind passage of the sample. Coronavirus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 reported from Wuhan.,"Korea until February 14, 2020. 2 In the outbreak situation, isolation of causative virus is indispensable for developing and evaluating diagnostic tools, therapeutics, and vaccine candidates. SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated using human airway epithelial cells and it was classified into the subgenus sarbecovirus of beta-CoVs by phylogenetic analyses of the gene sequences. 3 Both the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV were initially isolated and grew readily in Vero cells. 4, 5 Here, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using Vero cells from a patient entering Korea from Wuhan, China."
,"Protein quality control (PQC) is required to ensure cellular health. PQC is recognized for targeting the destruction of defective polypeptides, whereas regulated protein degradation mechanisms modulate the concentration of specific proteins in concert with physiological demands. For example, ion channel levels are physiologically regulated within tight limits, but a system-wide approach to define which degradative systems are involved is lacking. We focus on the Kir2.","Protein quality control (PQC) was initially described to reflect the fact that secreted proteins with various defects were unable to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specifically, defects in protein glycosylation, folding, or assembly or protein aggregation led to ER retention (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989) . More recently, it has become appreciated that PQC operates throughout the eukaryotic secretory pathway to ensure that toxic or misfolded proteins do not accumulate (Arvan et al., 2002; Apaja et al., 2010) . In turn, regulated protein degradative systems provide a means to fine tune wild-type protein levels and thus their activities. Therefore even folded and functional proteins may be destroyed if existing levels are toxic or do not match cellular needs. If PQC or the regulated protein degradation system is defective or if the PQC machinery fails to recognize an aberrant protein, one of many human diseases may result (Gestwicki and Garza, 2012; Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012) ."
Interleukin-10 is a Critical Regulator of White Matter Lesion Containment Following Viral Induced Demyelination,"Neurotropic coronavirus induces an acute encephalomyelitis accompanied by focal areas of demyelination distributed randomly along the spinal column. The initial areas of demyelination increase only slightly after the control of infection. These circumscribed focal lesions are characterized by axonal sparing, myelin ingestion by macrophage/microglia, and glial scars associated with hypertrophic astrocytes, which proliferate at the lesion border. Accelerated virus control in mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was associated with limited initial demyelination, but low viral mRNA persistence similar to WT mice and declining antiviral cellular immunity. Nevertheless, lesions exhibited sustained expansion providing a model of dysregulated white matter injury temporally remote from the acute CNS insult. Expanding lesions in the absence of IL-10 are characterized by sustained microglial activation and partial loss of macrophage/microglia exhibiting an acquired deactivation phenotype. Furthermore, IL-10 deficiency impaired astrocyte organization into mesh like structures at the lesion borders, but did not prevent astrocyte hypertrophy. The formation of discrete foci of demyelination in IL-10 sufficient mice correlated with IL-10 receptor expression exclusively on astrocytes in areas of demyelination suggesting a critical role for IL-10 signaling to astrocytes in limiting expansion of initial areas of white matter damage.","P laque formation in the CNS of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has been appreciated for over a century; however, how discrete plaques are restrained is poorly understood. Demyelination with no evidence of T cells as an early event in MS ( Barnett and Prineas, 2004) and expanding lesions with little or no T cells in autologous bone marrow recipients (Metz et al., 1994) both suggest expansion may be regulated by intrinsic pathological processes. The focal nature of white matter lesions in MS patients is also observed in rodents with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), spinal cord injury, and demyelination induced by gliatropic coronavirus infection (Bender and Weiss, 2010; Bergmann et al., 2006; Liedtke et al., 1998; Okada et al., 2006; Voskuhl et al., 2009) , supporting a conserved regulatory mechanism that restrains lesion expansion. Astrocytes are implicated as a criti-cal component, as glial scars formed by reactive astrocytes demarcate injured areas following trauma, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disease, and autoimmune disease, thus shielding adjacent healthy tissue from bystander damage (Cregg et al., 2014; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010) . Ablating astrocyte intermediate filaments or inducing apoptosis of dividing astrocytes attenuates gliosis as well as formation of discrete demyelination foci (Liedtke et al., 1998; Toft-Hansen et al., 2011) . Similarly, elimination of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-3, required for signaling via interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), specifically in astrocytes inhibits scar formation (Herrmann et al., 2008; Wanner et al., 2013) . By contrast, abrogation of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)-3 in astrocytes, thereby increasing STAT3 phosphorylation, limits lesion area,"
,"Association between the level of antibodies in bulk tank milk and bovine respiratory syncytial virus exposure in the herd T. B. Klem, T. Tollersrud, O. Østerås, M. Stokstad Antibody levels in bulk tank milk (BTM) against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are used to classify BRSV status of herds. The aim of this study was to investigate how these levels correspond with the time at which the herds were infected. Bulk tank milk, individual milk and serum samples from cows and young stock were investigated using an indirect ELISA. Screenings of BTM from 89 dairy herds during two winter seasons revealed a prevalence of positive herds from 82 per cent to 85 per cent. Eleven herds showed a marked increase in antibody levels between two screenings, indicating new infection. However, two of these herds had been free from BRSV for the last five to seven years. Two newly infected herds were monitored for four years and did not appear to get reinfected. Surprisingly, the BTM antibody levels in these herds remained high throughout the study period, but fluctuated significantly. This shows that the levels of antibodies in BTM can remain high for several years, even in herds where reinfection does not occur. BTM serology is a useful tool in the monitoring of infectious diseases in dairy herds, but has limitations as a diagnostic tool for BRSV infections.","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a pneumovirus of the paramyxoviridae family (Valarcher and Taylor 2007) . The infection is prevalent worldwide (Elvander 1996 , Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Klem and others 2013 , and BRSV is considered one of the major pathogens of the bovine respiratory disease complex (Griffin 1997 , Snowder and others 2006 , Brodersen 2010 . To diagnose the infection, different strategies can be chosen according to the given situation and the purpose. For larger epidemiological studies, antibody analyses are used (Hägglund and others 2006 , Beaudeau and others 2010 , Ohlson and others 2010 , Klem and others 2013 . Infected animals seroconvert and IgG can be measured in serum and milk long after the virus is no longer present. Studies on the longevity of antibodies against BRSV are scarce, but Elvander (1996) found that such antibodies could be detected in the serum of adult cattle for at least two years postinfection."
,"Case series summary This case series discusses novel characteristics identified in two cases of cowpox. One presented with upper airway signs, and was identified to have a focal laryngeal lesion. The other had central neurological signs at the terminal stages, with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies identified within the cerebral hemispheres on histopathology. Relevance and novel information Currently, cowpox would be an unlikely consideration in patients with neurological signs or upper respiratory noise. These cases both document novel presentations of cowpox infection, which clinicians should be aware of and consider as differential diagnoses in patients with these atypical presentations.","A number of different poxviruses can infect both people and domestic animals; with cowpox being the best described and most commonly encountered poxvirus infection of cats. Cowpox virus (CPxV) is a member of Orthopoxviridae family and is endemic in Northern Europe and western areas of the Soviet Union. 1 The usual route of infection is via skin inoculation from infected rodent bites, typically voles, or rarely via oronasal infection. 2 Reflective of this transmission route, skin lesions are commonly found on the head, neck and forelimbs. However, systemic illness such as pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy and/or pneumonia can occur during the viraemic phase and is usually associated with immune dysfunction and death. 3, 4 It is important that clinicians recognise the signs of potential CPxV infection and perform appropriate diagnostics early. A significant factor contributing to the prognosis of CPxV infection in cats is the speed at which appropriate therapy is instituted, so rapid recognition is crucial. Cytological analysis of the affected organs can be misleading, with the secondarily dysplastic cells having the potential to mimic neoplasma. Instead, electron microscopy, virus isolation and PCR of tissues (including skin scabs, bronchoalveolar or pleural fluid, or pulmonary aspirates) are the easiest ways to confirm the diagnosis. 5 Serum assays (including virus neutralisation, haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and ELISA) can be utilised to detect a humoral response to Novel characteristics identified in two cases of feline cowpox virus infection orthopoxvirus, although a rising titre is required to support active infection. 4 Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infection and recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω) to modulate the immune response. Antiviral drugs, such as famciclovir, commonly used for the treatment of feline herpesvirus (FeHV-1) disease in cats, 6 could also be considered; however, their efficacy against CPxV is unknown."

(online) Human bocavirus: Current knowledge and future challenges,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) 1, predominantly found in the respiratory tract; and, HBoV2, 3 and 4, mainly detected in stool and associated with gastroenteritis. Despite worldwide occurrence, human bocavirus infection remains poorly understood, and the comprehension of many aspects of these viruses' biology (i.e. , taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships with other viruses, epidemiology, molecular mechanisms of interaction with human cells, association with other pathogens, etc. ) is necessary to clarify whether they are harmless passengers or true pathogens. Development of new diagnostic tools for detection of human bocaviruses will support this type of research.","Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus isolated about a decade ago and found worldwide in both respiratory samples, mainly from early life and children of 6-24 mo of age with acute respiratory infection, and in stool samples, from patients with gastroenteritis. Since then, other viruses related to the first HBoV isolate (HBoV1), namely HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4, have been detected principally in human faeces. HBoVs are small nonenveloped single-stranded DNA viruses of about 5300 nucleotides, consisting of three open reading frames encoding the first two the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP1) and the third the viral capsid proteins 1 and 2 (VP1 and VP2). HBoV pathogenicity remains to be fully clarified mainly due to the lack of animal models for the difficulties in replicating the virus in in vitro cell cultures, and the fact that HBoV infection is frequently accompanied by at least another viral and/or bacterial respiratory and/or gastroenteric pathogen infection. Current diagnostic methods to support HBoV detection include polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and enzyme immunoassay using recombinant VP2 or virus-like particle capsid proteins, although sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms promise rapid and simultaneous detection of the pathogens in the future.

Address for correspondence Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Gene in Kawasaki Disease,"Polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is reported to be associated with ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kawasaki disease and insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene. Fifty five Kawasaki disease patients and 43 healthy children were enrolled. ACE genotype was evaluated from each of the subjects' DNA fragments through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD and high rate of ID genotype among Kawasaki patients (p<0.01). Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0%, p<0.05). In Kawasaki group, both genotype and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without. ACE gene I/D polymorphism is thought to be associated with Kawasaki disease but not with the development of coronary dilatations.","Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis and its diagnosis is made on clinical features. Main complication of the disease is coronary artery lesion that may result in myocardial infarction or sudden death. Coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia develop in approximately 15-25% of untreated children (1) . Since the intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and aspirin therapy have been introduced, its mortality rate has decreased to 0.1%, but cardiac sequelae continues to occur in about 13% of Kawasaki disease patients (2) ."

Ebola virus and H7N9 avian influenza virus are 2 lethal pathogens that we have encountered in the second decade of the 21st century. Ebola infection is currently being seen in West Africa, and H7N9 avian flu appears to have settled in Southeast Asia. This article focuses on the current situation and the future prospects of these potential infectious threats to mankind.","O utbreak is an epidemiological definition to describe an unexpected occurrence of an infection at a certain time and place. It may affect a small and a localized group, or impact on millions of people across continents. Two cases of a linked rare infection can be defined as an outbreak. A revisit through the history discloses that outbreaks were vast, deadly, and basically changed the course of human history. 1 As an example, the plague reshaped the landscape of Europe and the world between 1347 and 1351. During this period, the global population was estimated to be 450 million, and 75 million at a minimum are believed to have perished. Consequently, half of Europe died in a period of 4 years. 2 In the pre-antibiotic era, bacterial outbreaks caused much more mass destruction compared with other outbreaks with different infectious agents. 1 But, this trend changed with the advent of antibiotics and viral outbreaks emerged. We believed that Ebola virus and H7N9 avian influenza virus are the most potential pathogens to cause mass destruction in the world. Thus, in this paper, we will focus on the current outbreaks of these 2 viral infections with the potential to cause mass destruction, and to greatly impact the international travelers."
Complex structure of MERS-CoV RBD with DPP4 986 Structure of MERS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain complexed with human receptor DPP4,"The spike glycoprotein (S) of recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) targets the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Sequence comparison and modeling analysis have revealed a putative receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral spike, which mediates this interaction. We report the 3.0 Åresolution crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 β-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptorbinding subdomain. Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell. The atomic details at the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 provide structural understanding of the virus and receptor interaction, which can guide development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.","A novel coronavirus, recently named the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first identified in humans in the Middle East in 2012, and later in several European countries [1] [2] [3] . A sizable fraction (> 50%) of the infected patients developed severe respiratory illness and clinical symptoms similar to those seen during outbreak of severe acute respiratory symptom (SARS) caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV in 2003 [4] . In particular, preliminary epidemiology studies suggest human-to-human transmission of this deadly virus, leading to global concern about the potential for a MERS pandemic [5, 6] . Genetic and phy-logenetic characterization has shown that MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of the genus of betacoronavirus and is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5, although the direct source and reservoirs of MERS-CoV remain uncertain [2, 7, 8] . Like other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV virion utilizes a large surface spike (S) glycoprotein for interaction with and entry into the target cell [9, 10] . The S glycoprotein consists of a globular S1 domain at the N-terminal region, followed by membrane-proximal S2 domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain [11] [12] [13] . Determinants of cellular tropism and interaction with the target cell are within the S1 domain, while mediators of membrane fusion have been identified within the S2 domain [11, 12] . Through co-purification with the MERS-CoV S1 domain, Raj and colleagues [9] recently identified that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also called CD26) functions as a cellular receptor for MERS-CoV. DPP4 does not share any sequence or structural similarities to the previously identified human coronavirus receptors, such as angiotensin-converting www.cell-research.com | Cell Research Nianshuang Wang et al. 987 npg enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV [14, 15] and HCoV-NL63 [16] , or aminopeptidase N (APN) for HCoV-229E [17] . Like ACE2 and APN, however, DDP4 is expressed on the surface of several cell types, including those found in human airways, and possesses ectopeptidase activity, although this enzymatic function does not appear to be essential for viral entry [18] . Sequence and modeling analysis of S glycoproteins from several human coronaviruses has revealed a potential receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV [10, 19] . However, given the relatively low degree of homology between S glycoprotein sequences and mechanisms of interaction with distinct cell surface receptors, it is likely that there is a significant variability in structural features among respective RBD receptor pairs. Here, we report the crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD in complex with human DPP4 extracellular domain at a resolution of 3.0 Å."
Interleukin-35 as an Emerging Player in Tumor Microenvironment,"IL-35 is the newest member of IL-12 family. A dimeric protein consisting of two separate subunits has manifested suppressive actions on immune system, which is counterproductive in the context of cancers. Various reports have confirmed its inhibitory role on immune system which is carried out via formation of IL-35-producing regulatory T cells (iTr35), increased Treg development and suppressive Th17 cells growth. Although last decade has seen a great deal of scientific interest on this subject, the exact role, precise signal transduction and elaborative functions of IL-35 in tumor microenvironment (TME) remained elusive. Search for anti-IL-35 therapies have exhibited limited success in animal models. Contrarily, few studies have denied the idea that IL-35 plays a role in cancer. The purpose of this review is to analyze the reported scientific data on continuous symphony of IL-35 in cancers since the inception of former.","Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is a part of IL-12 family in addition to IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27. It is the newest member of IL-12 family which possesses antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties [1] . It is released primarily from stimulated natural Treg cells [2] , and its secretion is unfound in human non-stimulated Treg cells [3] . IL35-producing regulatory B cell (i35-Breg) [4] , stimulated pan T cells, CD4(+), CD8(+), CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell subpopulation [5] and CD8α + DC [6] are described in literature as IL-35 producing cells as well. Besides, T cells [7] and B cells population [8] , tumor-associated macrophages [9] and infiltrating dendritic cells [10] are also related with IL-35 upregulation. IL-35 is not a constitutive tissue product [11] and only expressed in certain tissues after pro-inflammatory activation by various stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-c (IFN-c), and IL-1β [12] . It was originally named in 13th International Congress of Immunology and currently grabs a significant attention of scientific community [13] ."
,"This study aimed to compare the indicators (the rates of diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion) of management of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in contacts and to identify the impact of active tuberculosis (TB) index case characteristics on the exposed population in congregated settings, such as schools, workplaces, and medical institutes. Methods: The data of 8,648 clusters in the TB epidemiological investigation database between 2013 and 2016 were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the indicators and perform multilevel logistic regression (MLR) analyses to identify the factors affecting each indicator. Results: The rates of total LTBI diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion were 15.2%, 10.2%, 69.4%, and 76.6%, respectively. After adjusting for other factors on MLR, the probability of diagnosis and need for treatment of latent TB in contacts was higher in most types of facilities than in schools. Conversely, treatment completion rates in these facilities were lower. Notably, the correctional institutions showed the highest odds ratio (OR) relative to school for LTBI diagnosis (OR, 6.37) and need for treatment (OR, 4.49) and the lowest OR for treatment completion (OR, 0.10). Conclusion: This study provided evidence for the implementation of latent TB control policies in congregated settings.","Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease, most commonly of the respiratory system, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The symptoms on presentation include chronic cough, fever, and production of sputum, among others.

Based on the four most recent years (2013-2016) of epidemiological investigations, data for 8,648 TB clusters (occurring in congregated settings) were available for the present study. The number of clusters and contacts analyzed by process are shown in Fig. 1 ."
Building and Optimizing a Virus-specific T Cell Receptor Library for Targeted Immunotherapy in Viral Infections,"Restoration of antigen-specific T cell immunity has the potential to clear persistent viral infection. T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy can reconstitute CD8 T cell immunity in chronic patients. We cloned 10 virus-specific TCRs targeting 5 different viruses, causing chronic and acute infection. All 10 TCR genetic constructs were optimized for expression using a P2A sequence, codon optimization and the addition of a non-native disulfide bond. However, maximum TCR expression was only achieved after establishing the optimal orientation of the alpha and beta chains in the expression cassette; 9/10 TCRs favored the beta-P2A-alpha orientation over alpha-P2A-beta. Optimal TCR expression was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of IFN-gamma1 T cells. In addition, activating cells for transduction in the presence of Toll-like receptor ligands further enhanced IFN-gamma production. Thus, we have built a virus-specific TCR library that has potential for therapeutic intervention in chronic viral infection or virus-related cancers.","Restoration of antigen-specific T cell immunity has the potential to clear persistent viral infection.

Lack of a virus-specific T cell response is associated with failure to control chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 1 and loss of virusspecific T cells due to immune suppression during hematopoietic stemcell or solid organ transplant can lead to life-threatening Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infections 2 . Reconstitution of virus-specific immunity, either through bone marrow transplant [3] [4] [5] or adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells 6, 7 , can control these persistent infections. In addition, data from influenza has demonstrated that pre-existing virus-specific T cell immunity can protect against lethal infection 8, 9 . Therefore, strategies to manipulate the virus-specific T cell response could lead to clinical therapies to treat chronic infections or prevent mortality related to severe acute infections."
Assembly of Vaccinia Virus: Role of the Intermediate Compartment Between the Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi Stacks,"Vaccinia virus, the prototype of the Poxviridae, is a large DNA virus which replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The assembly pathway of vaccinia virus displays several unique features, such as the production of two structurally distinct, infectious forms. One of these, termed intracellular naked virus (INV), remains cell associated while the other, termed extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), is released from the cell. In addition, it has long been believed that INVs acquire their lipid envelopes by a unique example of de novo membrane biogenesis. To examine the structure and assembly of vaccinia virus we have used immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to proteins of different subcellular compartments as well as a phospholipid analysis of purified INV and EEV. Our 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: EEV, extracellular enveloped virus; IBV, avian infectious bronchitis virus; IEV, intracellular enveloped virus; IMV, intracellular mature virus; INV, intracellular naked virus; MOI, multiplicity of infection; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PFU, plaque forming units; PI, postinfection; SLO, streptolysin O; VV, vaccinia virus.","data are not consistent with the de novo model of viral membrane synthesis but rather argue that the vaccinia virus DNA becomes enwrapped by a membrane cisterna derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step. Phospholipid analysis of purified INV supports its derivation from an early biosynthetic compartment. This unique assembly process is repeated once more when the INV becomes enwrapped by an additional membrane cisterna, in agreement with earlier reports. The available data suggest that after fusion between the outer envelope and the plasma membrane, mature EEV is released from the cell. V ACCINIA virus is the best studied member of the family Poxviridae, the largest and most complex of the animal viruses (for reviews see Dales and Pogo, 1981; Fenner et al., 1989; Moss, 1991) . Its double-stranded linear DNA genome of 191 kbp has been sequenced and 263 potential genes have been identified (Goebel et al., 1990) . Unlike other DNA viruses, vaccinia virus replicates and assembles in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Both replication and assembly occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci termed viral factories which are thought to be devoid of cellular organelles and membranes (Joklik and Becker, 1964) . Assembly is first manifested by the appearance of crescent-shaped membranes within the viral factories. These membranes eventually form spherical, immature virions which undergo additional maturational events, including the cleavage of viral core proteins (Moss and Rosenblum, 1973) , to give rise to the first infectious, brick-shaped form of vaccinia virus (Dales and Pogo, 1981) . This viral form is by far the best characterized and has long been referred to as intracellular ""naked"" virus (INV) 1 despite the fact that it is bound by at least one lipid envelope. Phospholipid comprises ""~5 % of the INV by weight (Zwartouw, 1964) and disruption of the envelope by nonionic detergent increases its apparent density in cesium chloride gradients (Doms et al., 1990) . A variable amount of the INV is thought to be transported to the Golgi region of the cell (Ichihashi et al., 1971; Morgan, 1976; Hiller and Weber, 1985) where it is enwrapped by a membrane cisterna. The available data argue that this enwrapped form of the virus loses the outermost of its two newly acquired bilayers by fusing with the plasma membrane, after which it is released into the medium (Dales and Pogo, 1981; Fenner et al., 1989) . This second infectious form of the vi-rus, termed extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), contains additional polypeptides when compared with the INV (Payne, 1978) and is important for the dissemination of vaccinia both in cell culture and in the host animal (Payne, 1980; Payne and Kristensson, 1985; Moss, 1991, 1992) ."
"Molecular dynamics simulations of human tRNA Lys,3 UUU : the role of modified bases in mRNA recognition","Accuracy in translation of the genetic code into proteins depends upon correct tRNA-mRNA recognition in the context of the ribosome. In human tRNA Lys;3 UUU three modified bases are present in the anticodon stem-loop-2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (ms 2 t 6 A37), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34 (mcm 5 s 2 U34) and pseudouridine (c) at position 39-two of which, ms 2 t 6 A37 and mcm 5 s 2 U34, are required to achieve wild-type binding activity of wild-type human tRNA Lys;3 ]. Molecular dynamics simulations of nine tRNA anticodon stem-loops with different combinations of nonstandard bases were performed. The wild-type simulation exhibited a canonical anticodon stairstepped conformation. The ms 2 t 6 modification at position 37 is required for maintenance of this structure and reduces solvent accessibility of U36. Ms 2 t 6 A37 generally hydrogen bonds across the loop and may prevent U36 from rotating into solution. A water molecule does coordinate to c39 most of the simulation time but weakly, as most of the residence lifetimes are ,40 ps.","Nonstandard bases are most prevalently found in tRNA molecules and may involve a variety of modifications from simple methylation to addition of a peptide moiety (1, 2) . Some tRNA molecules require posttranscriptionally modified nucleic acid bases for proper translation (3, 4) , recognition by proteins (5, 6) and initiation of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcription (7) . Specifically, ribosomal binding (8, 9) , proper translocation from the aminoacyl site (A) to peptidyl site (P site) (10, 11) and translational speed (12) may be dependent upon nonstandard bases, while the lack of modified bases may result in frameshifting errors (13) ."
Association of specific viral infections with childhood asthma exacerbations,"Introduction: Asthma exacerbations may occur due to a variety of triggers including respiratory viruses. , Iran between 2014 and 2015. A nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab was obtained from each patient during admission. All samples were maintained at 4°C until submission to the virology laboratory and were tested for respiratory viruses by nucleic acid testing. Results: A total of 60 patients with asthma exacerbations were recruited for this study. Of the 60 samples collected from the patients with acute asthma exacerbations, rhinovirus was detected in 12 patients (20%), respiratory syncytial virus in 5 (8%), adenovirus in 5 (8%), and influenza virus in 1 (1.6%). Respiratory pathogens were not detected in 37 (61%) samples. All the samples investigated showed single viral infection. Conclusions: To conclude, the most common viruses detected were rhinovirus followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. RSV was more commonly associated with more severe attacks. Both the study design (e.g., time of sampling, age of the patients, etc.) and also the method used for viral detection influence the frequency of detection of the respiratory viruses.","Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease associated with an increasing prevalence characterized by airway inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness [1] . Bronchial hyperresponsiveness may occur in response to many common environmental triggers [2, 3] leading to asthma exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations are acute or subacute worsening episodes of shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness [4] , which are classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening. These exacerbations may be associated with a variety of respiratory viruses, including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenzavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus [5] , of which the first two mentioned groups are most importantly relevant to asthma development [6] . Viral respiratory infections are usually self-limiting illnesses [4] . However, they may exert profound effects on important aspects of asthma [7] . Studies suggest a substantial role for viral infections in about 50% of asthma exacerbations"
Elastase-mediated Activation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Protein at Discrete Sites within the S2 Domain * □ S,"2 The abbreviations used are: S, spike; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MLV, murine leukemia virus; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-gubbing non-integrin, ACE2, argiotensin I conserting enzyme 2.","Proteolytic priming is a common method of controlling the activation of membrane fusion mediated by viral glycoproteins. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV S) can be primed by a variety of host cell proteases, with proteolytic cleavage occurring both as the S1/S2 boundary and adjacent to a fusion peptide in the S2 domain. Here, we studied the priming of SARS-CoV S by elastase and show an important role for residue Thr 795 in the S2 domain. A series of alanine mutants were generated in the vicinity of the S2 cleavage site, with the goal of examining elastase-mediated cleavage within S2. Both proteolytic cleavage and fusion activation were modulated by altering the cleavage site position. We propose a novel mechanism whereby SARS-CoV fusion protein function can be controlled by spatial regulation of the proteolytic priming site, with important implications for viral pathogenesis."
i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is nowadays widely used to identify genes involved in human complex disease. The standard GWAS analysis examines SNPs/genes independently and identifies only a number of the most significant SNPs. It ignores the combined effect of weaker SNPs/genes, which leads to difficulties to explore biological function and mechanism from a systems point of view. Although gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) has been introduced to GWAS to overcome these limitations by identifying the correlation between pathways/gene sets and traits, the heavy dependence on genotype data, which is not easily available for most published GWAS investigations, has led to limited application of it. In order to perform GSEA on a simple list of GWAS SNP P-values, we implemented GSEA by using SNP label permutation. We further improved GSEA (i-GSEA) by focusing on pathways/gene sets with high proportion of significant genes. To provide researchers an open platform to analyze GWAS data, we developed the i-GSEA4GWAS (improved GSEA for GWAS) web server. i-GSEA4GWAS implements the i-GSEA approach and aims to provide new insights in complex disease studies. i-GSEA4GWAS is freely available at","Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has become a popular approach by utilizing genome-wide genotyping array to map susceptibility effects through examining associations between SNP genotype frequency and traits (1, 2) . The standard GWAS analysis focuses on single SNP/gene and identifies only a number of the most significant SNPs that account for only a small proportion of the genetic variants and offers limited understanding of complex diseases (3) . It also ignores the combined SNP/ gene effects representing interactions of multiple genetic factors of complex disease, which lead to difficulties in exploring biological function and mechanism from a systems point of view."
"Epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis in Shandong, China",This study aimed to analyze the epidemiology of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and gained insight into the future TB control plan in China.,"Monitoring time trends and measuring the burden of tuberculosis (TB) is critical for the evaluation of whether global targets are achieved and for planning TB control interventions. To eradicate TB, the World Health Organization establishes the end TB strategy which outlines an overall goal of 90% reduction in incidence and 95% reduction in mortality, compared with 2015 baseline. [1] Although great achievements have been obtained for TB control, TB still develops into the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, ranking above human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. [1] Globally, 10 million people (64% new cases) suffer from TB and 1.6 million people die of TB in 2017. [1] It is uncertain if maintaining the current strategies will be enough for human to reach the 2035 target. [2] Since 1990s, China has implemented a high-quality directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy in Center for Disease Control (CDC) public health clinics in 13 provinces (including Shandong province) covering half the country's population. [3] However, only 30% of the estimated new smear-positive TB cases were treated under this program till 2000. [4] To accelerate the national TB control efforts, several strategies have developed since 2000. The Chinese government expanded the DOTS strategy nationwide with its free treatment policy to also cover active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in 2000 and smear-negative PTB in 2005 (before 2000, free treatment were provided only for smear-positive patients). [5] Moreover, after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government increased publichealth funding, revised laws on TB control, introduced internetbased disease reporting system, and rebuilt local publichealth facilities to accelerate the performance of TB control programs. [6] [7] [8] With those strategies, a 48% reduction in bacteriologically positive TB and a 65% reduction in smearpositive TB were achieved between 1990 and 2010, dramatically contributing to the realization of the stop TB strategy. [4, 5, 9, 10] However, China still ranks second among the 30 high TB-burden countries and has the world's largest number of patients with multidrug-resistant. [1] TB remains an ongoing intractable health challenge in China."
Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.ae Exploration of New Sites in Adenovirus Hexon for Foreign Peptides Insertion,"Adenoviral vectors are now being explored as vaccine carriers to prevent infectious diseases in humans and animals. There are two strategies aimed at the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vectors. The first includes an insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. The second strategy is antigen incorporation into the viral capsid proteins. To extend this methodology, we have searched for new sites at the human adenovirus serotype 5 major capsid protein hexon for a vaccine antigen insertion. To this end, we utilized sites in the hexon hypervariable region (HVR) 7, 8 and 9 to display a 15-mer peptide containing the main neutralizing epitope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. However, we could not rescue the viruses with the insertions of the peptide into HVR 8 and 9, consistent with the viruses being unable to tolerate insertions at these sites. In contrast, the virus with the insertion of the peptide in HVR 7 was viable -growing well in cell culture and the inserted peptide was exposed on the virion surface.","Human adenovirus type 5 (hAd5) vector has been shown to be an excellent vaccine delivery system in humans and animals [1, 2] . The replication-defective (E1-deleted) and replication-competent (E3-deleted) hAd5 have both been used as vaccine delivery vectors. For biosafety concerns, a replication-defective hAd5 is considered to be more suitable for vaccination. Replication-defective vectors may also have deletion in the E3 region to increase the amount of foreign DNA that can be inserted. Conventional strategy for the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vector includes insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. This antigen is expressed as transgene after the infection of permissive cells with recombinant adenovirus."
DotKnot: pseudoknot prediction using the probability dot plot under a refined energy model,"RNA pseudoknots are functional structure elements with key roles in viral and cellular processes. Prediction of a pseudoknotted minimum free energy structure is an NP-complete problem. Practical algorithms for RNA structure prediction including restricted classes of pseudoknots suffer from high runtime and poor accuracy for longer sequences. A heuristic approach is to search for promising pseudoknot candidates in a sequence and verify those. Afterwards, the detected pseudoknots can be further analysed using bioinformatics or laboratory techniques. We present a novel pseudoknot detection method called DotKnot that extracts stem regions from the secondary structure probability dot plot and assembles pseudoknot candidates in a constructive fashion. We evaluate pseudoknot free energies using novel parameters, which have recently become available. We show that the conventional probability dot plot makes a wide class of pseudoknots including those with bulged stems manageable in an explicit fashion. The energy parameters now become the limiting factor in pseudoknot prediction. DotKnot is an efficient method for long sequences, which finds pseudoknots with higher accuracy compared to other known prediction algorithms. DotKnot is accessible as a web server at","RNA is a versatile nucleic acid, which is no longer seen as the passive intermediate between DNA and proteins. Numerous functional RNAs with an astonishing variety have been uncovered in the past decade. For example, non-coding RNAs participate in a wide range of cellular processes, are able to regulate gene expression and can act as catalyst (1, 2) . Macromolecule function is closely connected to its 3D folding and structure prediction from the base sequence is thus of great importance. RNA structure formation is understood to be hierarchical and, therefore, secondary structure prediction is the foundation for determining the tertiary folding (3, 4) ."
Jet set pets: examining the zoonosis risk in animal import and travel across the european Union,"Ownership of companion animals or pets is popular throughout the world. Unfortunately, such animals are susceptible to and potential reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. Close proximity to and contact with pets can lead to human infections. The distribution of zoonotic diseases associated with companion animals such as dogs and cats is not uniform around the world, and moving animals between regions, countries, and continents carries with it the risk of relocating the pathogens they might harbor. Critical among these zoonotic diseases are rabies, echinococcosis, and leishmania. In addition, the protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia duodenalis, are also significant agents for human disease of pet origin. Considerable effort is applied to controlling movements of companion animals, particularly dogs, into the European Union. However, free movement of people and their pets within the European Union is a risk factor for the translocation of diseases and their vectors. This review considers the current distribution of some of these diseases, the risks associated with pet travel, and the controls implemented within Europe to prevent the free movement of zoonotic pathogens.","Two features of human behavior throughout history are striking. The first has been the domestication of numerous animals for food production, as working animals for activities such as transport, and for hunting purposes. They are also, particularly in modern times, used as a source of companionship, and in the USA alone there are estimated to be over 77 million dogs. 1 The second feature is our propensity to travel. This trait has accelerated in the modern age through technical innovations such as the motor car, air travel, and international shipping. 2 Human travel through migration, leisure, or business continues to increase in parallel with a population increase and the spread of affluence. This provides opportunities for pathogens to move to new areas and cause outbreaks of disease. Commercial air travel has been particularly effective at transporting pathogens such as SARS coronavirus and influenza viruses. 3 It is also contributing to the spread of disease vectors and the diseases they transmit. 4 As we travel, we take animals with us either through trade in livestock or in the movement of companion animals."
The RNA polymerase activity of SARS-coronavirus nsp12 is primer dependent,"An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the central catalytic subunit of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of all positive-strand RNA viruses. Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the $30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNAdependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is primer dependent on both homo-and heteropolymeric templates, supporting the likeliness of a close enzymatic collaboration with the intriguing RNA primase activity that was recently proposed for coronavirus nsp8.","The central enzymatic activity in the life cycle of positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses is the process of RNA-templated RNA synthesis. In mammalian cells, the replication of +RNA genomes always occurs in the cytoplasm where the viral RNA-synthesizing machinery is commonly associated with (modified) cytoplasmic membranes, which presumably provide physical support and may serve to protect the complex from host defense mechanisms (1, 2) . The viral enzyme complex contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as its core catalytic subunit for the production of negative strand RNA (-RNA), new genome molecules and in many virus groups also subgenomic (sg) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (1, 3) ."
In Vivo Analysis of Glial Cell Phenotypes during a Viral Demyelinating Disease in Mice,"C57 BL/6N mice injected intracranially with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus exhibit extensive viral replication in glial cells of the spinal cord and develop demyelinating lesions followed by virus clearing and remyelination. To study how different glial cell types are affected by the disease process, we combine three-color immunofluorescence labeling with tritiated thymidine autoradiography on 1-t~m frozen sections of spinal cord. We use three different glial cell specific antibodies (a) to 2' 3' cyclic-nucleotide 3' phosphohydrolase (CNP) expressed by oligodendrocytes, (b) to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressed by astrocytes, and (c) the 04 antibody which binds to O-2A progenitor cells in the rat. These progenitor cells, which give rise to oligodendroeytes and type 2 astrocytes and react with the 04 antibody in the adult central nervous system, were present but rare in the spinal cord of uninfected mice. In contrast, cells with the O-2A progenitor phenotype (04+ only) were increased in number at one week post viral inoculation 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CNP, 2""3"" ¢yclic-nucleotide 3' phosphohydrolase; CNS, central nervous system; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; WPI, weeks post inoculation.","(1 WPI) and were the only immunostained cells labeled at that time by a 2-h in vivo pulse of tritiated thymidine. Both GFAP+ only and GFAP+, 04+ astrocytes were also increased in the spinal cord at 1 WPI. Between two and four WPI, the infected spinal cord was characterized by the loss of (CNP+, 04+) oligodendrocytes within demyelinating lesions and the presence of O-2A progenitor cells and 04+, GFAP+ astrocytes, both of which could be labeled with thymidine. As remyelination proceeded, CNP immunostaining returned to near normal and tritiated thymidine injected previously during the demyelinating phase now appeared in CNP+ oligodendrocytes. Thus 04 positive O-2A progenitor cells proliferate early in the course of the demyelinating disease, while CNP positive oligodendrocytes do not. The timing of events suggests that the O-2A progenitors may give rise to new oligodendrocytes and to type 2 astrocytes, both of which are likely to be instrumental in the remyelination process. I s small rodents, regeneration of central nervous system (CNS) ~ myelin is often efficient after a demyelinating episode (reviewed in Ludwin, 1981) . In contrast, in multiple sclerosis, the paradigm of demyelinating diseases in human CNS, remyelination is often insufficient (reviewed in Silberberg, 1986) . Thus it appears important to elucidate the exact cellular and molecular events underlying CNS remyelination."
The human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 is necessary for the production of Group 2 influenza A virus pseudotypes,"The monomer of influenza haemagglutinin is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor that during maturation is cleaved by proteases into two active subunits. Other studies have demonstrated that the human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave the HA of human seasonal influenza viruses. Consequently, we have investigated the use of human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 to produce high titre influenza haemmagglutinin (HA) lentiviral pseudotypes from Group 2 influenza viruses. Such pseudotypes represent powerful and safe tools to study viral entry and immune responses. Influenza pseudotype particles are obtained by co-transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells using plasmids coding for the influenza HA, HIV gag-pol and a lentiviral vector incorporating firefly luciferase. However, in order to produce Group 2 pseudotypes, it was necessary to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 endoprotease, to achieve the necessary HA cleavage for infective particle generation. These lentiviral pseudotypes were shown to transduce HEK293T/17 cells with high efficiency. This demonstrates that TMPRSS2 is necessary for the functional activation, in vitro, of both the HA of human seasonal influenza and other Group 2 HA influenza strains. Additionally, we show that the Group 2 influenza pseudotype particles can be used as surrogate antigens in neutralization assays and are efficiently neutralized by corresponding influenza virus reference sera. These data demonstrate that the viral pseudotype system is a powerful method for serological surveillance of a wide range of influenza viruses.","Influenza A viruses are disease-causing agents in humans and animals, which have a reservoir in wild birds, especially Charadriiformes and Anseriformes (Olsen et al, 2006) . Influenza A viruses are classified using the antigenic characteristic of the envelope glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, using antigenic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, 17 different haemagglutinin subtypes are recognized and are divided into two lineages: Group-1 and Group-2 ( Figure 1 ) (Röhm et al, 1996; Fouchier et al, 2005; Tong et al, 2012) . Of the 17 haemagglutinin subtypes only two, H1 and H3, cause seasonal epidemics in the human population. However, viruses belonging to other subtypes have shown the capacity for avian-to-human transmission and their spread needs to be monitored in avian and mammalian populations for pandemic preparedness (Peiris, 2009 ). This can be achieved using serological and molecular biological diagnostic methods that permit the identification of haemagglutinin subtypes (Cattoli and Terregino, 2008) . The haemagglutinin is the major target of antibody response against influenza viruses. It is the trimeric envelope glycoprotein necessary for entry into susceptible cells. Each HA monomer is produced as a single polypeptide precursor, HA0, that during maturation is cleaved into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. This process is a necessary step to acquire fusion activity and infectivity of influenza. When multiple basic amino acid residues (lysine and arginine) are situated immediately before the cleavage arginine, the haemagglutinin is cleaved by ubiquitously expressed subtilisin-like endoproteases, such as furin. This determines the virulence and lethality for several avian species observed in the high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) strains H5 and H7 (Garten and Klenk, 2008) . On the other hand, cleavage at the single arginine (or lysine) amino acid at the HA cleavage site of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) strains, human and mammalian influenza viruses is thought to be mediated by tissue-specific proteases. Recently, different human lung proteases belonging to the serine protease family that are able to cleave the haemagglutinin of human influenza strains were identified: Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 and 4 (TMPRSS2/4) and Human Airway Trypsin-like protease (HAT) (Böttcher et al, 2006; Bertram et al, 2010) . To date, the proteases that cleave the haemagglutinin of LPAI strains are still unidentified. To study the HA cleavage of human seasonal strains (H1 and H3) by TMPRSS2, HAT and their avian and mammalian homologous proteases, pseudotype lentiviral particles are a suitable approach (Bertram et al, 2012) . Influenza pseudotype particles (pp) represent powerful and safe tools to study both the antibody response directed against the influenza haemagglutinin and the viral entry mechanism (Garcia and Lai, 2011) . In the present study, we use a pseudotype generation system to investigate human TMPRSS2 and its role in mediating the conversion of human and LPAI HA0s into their active forms, and we show that the pseudotypes produced can be efficiently used in a virus neutralization assay."
SURVEY AND SUMMARY Miniaturized PCR chips for nucleic acid amplification and analysis: latest advances and future trends,"The possibility of performing fast and small-volume nucleic acid amplification and analysis on a single chip has attracted great interest. Devices based on this idea, referred to as micro total analysis, microfluidic analysis, or simply 'Lab on a chip' systems, have witnessed steady advances over the last several years. Here, we summarize recent research on chip substrates, surface treatments, PCR reaction volume and speed, architecture, approaches to eliminating cross-contamination and control and measurement of temperature and liquid flow. We also discuss product-detection methods, integration of functional components, biological samples used in PCR chips, potential applications and other practical issues related to implementation of lab-on-a-chip technologies.","In many cases, amplification is indispensable for the analysis of nucleic acids. Currently, nucleic acid amplification methods include but are not limited to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (1), strand-displacement amplification (SDA), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and the Q b replicase reaction. Among these methods, PCR has been the most popular due to its simplicity; however Peltier effect or metal-block-based PCR system are characterized by high thermal mass, large reaction volume and thus slow heating/cooling rates. The PCR speed can be improved by increasing the heat transfer rate or decreasing the thermal mass. With the advent of micro-electromechanical-systems (MEMS) technology, the development of miniaturized PCR chips becomes possible (2, 3) . The miniaturization of PCR devices offers several advantages such as short assay time, low reagent consumption and rapid heating/cooling rates, as well as great potential of integrating multiple processing modules to reduce size and power consumption. The number of publications on PCR chips has grown rapidly recently, and the articles are spread over a large number of journals. The development of PCR microchips has been discussed in recent reviews (2) (3) (4) . In this article, we will review the latest advances and future trends based on literature published since January 2005. In addition, we will also discuss some practical issues related to the development of PCR chips. As a supplement to this review, the reader may wish to refer to several reviews of general microfluidic technologies (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) ."
"Seroprevalence of Dirofilaria immitis in Cats from Liaoning Province, Northeastern China","The present study was performed to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors for Dirofilaria immitis infection in cats from Liaoning province, northeastern China. From October 2014 to September 2016, sera of 651 cats, including 364 domestic cats and 287 feral cats (332 females and 319 males) were assessed. They were tested for the presence of D. immitis antigen using SNAP Heartworm RT test kit. In this population, the average prevalence was 4.5%. Age and rearing conditions (feral or domestic) were found to be associated with the prevalence of D. immitis. The prevalence was significantly higher in feral cats compared with domestic cats (8.4% vs 1.4%, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between males and females (4.7% vs 4.2%, P > 0.05), but older cats (≥ 3 years old) showed a statistically higher prevalence compared with younger cats (< 3 years old) in feral populations (16.8 vs 2.4%, P < 0.01), while the difference between the age groups was not statistically significant in domestic cats (2.4% vs 0.51%, P > 0.05), all these results suggest that outdoor exposure time may be one of the most important factors for D. immitis prevalence in cats. Results reveal that D. immitis are prevalence in domestic and feral cats in northeastern China, which indicates that appropriate preventive measures should be taken to decrease the incidence of feline heartworm disease in Liaoning province, northeastern China.","Dirofilaria immitis, the etiologic agent of canine heartworm disease, is commonly found in the pulmonary artery and right ventricle of dogs and other animals. It could infect dogs, cats, and various wild mammals, with increased incidence in temperate and tropical areas [1] . The heartworm parasite is transmitted by various mosquito species, including Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex [2, 3] . After mosquitoes feed on an infected microfilaremic reservoir host, the mosquitoes act as intermediate hosts, carrying infectious ""larvae 3"" (L3) stage larvae, which could be transmitted to a dog or a cat [4] ."

[1] There is a significantly positive correlation between burnout and psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress) in nurses. [2, 3] In nurses working in Norway, the prevalence of anxiety and depression has been reported to be 19.2% and 8.4%, respectively, [4] which is higher than that of the adults in Nepal (16.1% and 4.2%). [5] A high incidence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported in nurses working in China and Hong Kong. [6, 7] Furthermore, the prevalence of ""burnout syndrome"" is significantly higher among oncology nurses than among surgical nurses. [8] Furthermore, oncology nurses have high levels of emotional exhaustion, and a large proportion of them are at risk of developing burnout. [9, 10] However, burnout and mental health of nurses are strongly associated with the quality of patient care. [11] [12] [13] Noben et al. conducted a cost-benefit analysis of mental health programs for hospital nurses. They concluded that offering preventive intervention represents a favorable business case as seen from the employer's perspective. [14] A stress-reduced program based on mindfulness meditation was reported to improve stress, burnout, depression, and anxiety significantly. [15] Therefore, focus on nurses' mental health, as well as reducing the prevalence of burnout of nursing staff, is valuable."
Irreversible inactivation of ISG15 by a viral leader protease enables alternative infection detection strategies,"In response to viral infection, cells mount a potent inflammatory response that relies on ISG15 and ubiquitin posttranslational modifications. Many viruses use deubiquitinases and deISGylases that reverse these modifications and antagonize host signaling processes. We here reveal that the leader protease, Lb pro , from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) targets ISG15 and to a lesser extent, ubiquitin in an unprecedented manner. Unlike canonical deISGylases that hydrolyze the isopeptide linkage after the Cterminal GlyGly motif, Lb pro cleaves the peptide bond preceding the GlyGly motif. Consequently, the GlyGly dipeptide remains attached to the substrate Lys, and cleaved ISG15 is rendered incompetent for reconjugation. A crystal structure of Lb pro bound to an engineered ISG15 suicide probe revealed the molecular basis for ISG15 proteolysis. Importantly, anti-GlyGly antibodies, developed for ubiquitin proteomics, are able to detect Lb pro cleavage products during viral infection. This opens avenues for infection detection of FMDV based on an immutable, host-derived epitope.","In response to viral infection, cells mount a potent inflammatory response that relies on ISG15 and ubiquitin posttranslational modifications.

Social Network Characteristics and Body Mass Index in an Elderly Korean Population,"Research has shown that obesity appears to spread through social ties. However, the association between other characteristics of social networks and obesity is unclear. This study aimed to identify the association between social network characteristics and body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ) in an elderly Korean population.","The study of the effects of social networks on health rose to the surface in the 1970s through pioneers such as Cassel, Cobb, pISSN 1975 -8375 eISSN 2233 and Berkman, who theorized or proved empirically that social networks could affect mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . After those mortality studies, several studies have reported that social networks are related to infectious diseases, such as sexually transmitted disease [7] [8] [9] , tuberculosis [10] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [11] , and pneumonia [12] . Additionally, evidence suggests that emotions and related behaviors such as depression [13] , suicide [14] , and happiness [15] are also associated with social networks. Social networks affect health through several mechanisms, including the provision of social support (both perceived and actual), social influence (e.g., norms, social control), social engagement, person-to-person contact (e.g., pathogen exposure, secondhand cigarette smoke), and access to resourc-es (e.g., money, jobs, information) [16] ."

Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients. Methods: We present the case of a 34-year-old man with X-linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen. Results: Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue. Interpretation: Cache Valley virus, a mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self-limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes. ANN NEUROL 2017; 82:105-114 O utbreaks of emerging and reemerging pathogens have stimulated international discussion about the most efficient means for improving early detection so that public and private resources can be mobilized quickly and efficiently to limit widespread transmission and treat affected patients. There is a growing consensus that an optimal surveillance regimen will (1) incorporate an unbiased approach to pathogen identification and (2) focus surveillance efforts on groups of people at high risk for unusual infections (eg, immunodeficient patients and people with relevant exposures). [1] [2] [3] An unbiased approach to pathogen identification is important because traditional candidate-based diagnostic tests essentially fail to identify novel and unusual pathogens, usually due to perceived rarity or exclusion from clinical consideration based on established geographical distribution. Global surveillance efforts need to be streamlined, because it is both time-consuming and costly for physicians to order many pathogen-specific tests for geographically and clinically novel organisms. Finally, in the modern era, when international travel has become so commonplace, the need for improved pathogen detection has become clear."
The Case for Laboratory Developed Procedures: Quality and Positive Impact on Patient Care,"An explosion of knowledge and technology is revolutionizing medicine and patient care. Novel testing must be brought to the clinic with safety and accuracy, but also in a timely and cost-effective manner, so that patients can benefit and laboratories can offer testing consistent with current guidelines. Under the oversight provided by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, laboratories have been able to develop and optimize laboratory procedures for use in-house. Quality improvement programs, interlaboratory comparisons, and the ability of laboratories to adjust assays as needed to improve results, utilize new sample types, or incorporate new mutations, information, or technologies are positive aspects of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments oversight of laboratory-developed procedures. Laboratories have a long history of successful service to patients operating under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. A series of detailed clinical examples illustrating the quality and positive impact of laboratory-developed procedures on patient care is provided. These examples also demonstrate how Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments oversight ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible testing in clinical laboratories.","The field of pathology offers the opportunity to better understand the science behind the mechanisms of disease, to lead innovation of new diagnostic technologies, to provide quality oversight of these developments, and to have enormous impact on the lives of patients every day. Patients benefit from laboratory medicine testing throughout their lives as every medical decision can be impacted by the result of a laboratory test. Laboratory results constitute the majority of data in a patient's electronic medical record, and our procedures dictate the majority of downstream medical decisions for patients. 1, 2 Clinical laboratory medical professionals have the unique responsibility to patients for assessing the performance of technologies in providing the most accurate information to ensure the most appropriate and efficient course of care."
A Transfected Sialyltransferase That Is Elevated in Breast Cancer and Localizes to the medial/ trans -Golgi Apparatus Inhibits the Development of core-2-based O-Glycans,"The ␣ 2,3 sialyltransferase, ␣ 2,3 SAT (O),","catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to Gal ␤ 1,3 N -acetyld -galactosamine (GalNAc) (core-1) in mucin type O-glycosylation, and thus terminates chain extension. A Core-2 branch can also be formed from core-1 by the core-2 ␤ 1,6 N -acetyld -glucosamine transferase ( ␤ 1,6 GlcNAc T) that leads to chain extension. Increased levels of the ␣ 2,3 SAT (O) and decreased levels of the core-2 ␤ 1,6 GlcNAc T are seen in breast cancer cells and correlate with differences in the structure of the O-glycans synthesized (Brockhausen et al., 1995; Lloyd et al., 1996) . Since in mucin type O-glycosylation sugars are added individually and sequentially in the Golgi apparatus, the position of the transferases, as well as their activity, can determine the final structure of the O-glycans synthesized. A cDNA coding for the human ␣ 2,3 SAT (O) tagged with an immunoreactive epitope from the myc gene has been used to map the position of the glycosyltransferase in nontumorigenic (MTSV1-7) and malignant (T47D) breast epithelial cell lines. Transfectants were analyzed for expression of the enzyme at the level of message and protein, as well as for enzymic activity. In T47D cells, which do not express core-2 ␤ 1,6 GlcNAc T, the increased activity of the sialyltransferase correlated with increased sialylation of core-1 O-glycans on the epithelial mucin MUC1. Furthermore, in MTSV1-7 cells, which do express core-2 ␤ 1,6 GlcNAc T, an increase in sialylated core-1 structures is accompanied by a reduction in the ratio of GlcNAc: GalNAc in the O-glycans attached to MUC1, implying a decrease in branching. Using quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, the sialyltransferase was mapped to the medial-and trans -Golgi cisternae, with some being present in the TGN. The data represent the first fine mapping of a sialyltransferase specifically active in O-glycosylation and demonstrate that the structure of O-glycans synthesized by a cell can be manipulated by transfecting with recombinant glycosyltransferases. I n eukaryotic cells, proteins are synthesized in the ER from where they are transported to different locations, either within the cell or to the plasma membrane. Along the exocytic pathway, proteins undergo various modifications including proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and sulfation. Within this pathway there are two main types of glycosylation, N-linked and mucin-type O-linked. The addition of N-linked glycans is initiated in the ER by the addition to asparagine of an oligosaccharide chain via an intermediate lipid carrier. This chain is then modified by trimming and the addition of sugars. In contrast, mucin-type O-linked glycosylation is thought to be initiated in the cis -Golgi cisternae where the first sugar, N -acetyld -galactosamine (GalNAc), 1 is added to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine (Roth et al., 1994; Clausen and Bennett, 1996) . The oligosaccharide chains are then built up by the sequential addition of individual sugars, each reaction being catalyzed by a specific enzyme or enzymes (Brockhausen, 1996) . Thus, the final structure of the O-glycans is strongly influenced, not only by the level of activity of an enzyme but also by its position within the Golgi apparatus."

,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate psychometric properties of the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) in a sample of Korean older adults. Methods One-hundred ninety two participants aged 65 and over completed interview-based questionnaires about chronotype, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, a small subset of subjects completed a 7-day sleep diary and actigraphy measurements. Results Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) scores were significantly negatively correlated with Midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated through weekdays (MSFsc) (r=-0.45, p<0.01) assessed by the MCTQ. MSFsc using the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with MSFsc assessed by both the sleep diary (r=0.74, p<0.05) and actigraphy (r=0.76, p<0.05). Additionally, MSFsc assessed by the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with insomnia (r=0.26, p<0.01), depression (r=0.25, p<0.01), and anxiety (r=0.18, p<0.05). Finally, based on MEQ scores, we derived a cut-off score for the MCTQ that distinguishes morning type and other types (intermediate/evening types) in older adults. Conclusion The results of these studies supported the validity of the MCTQ in Korean older adults. Additionally, while sleep rhythms in elder adults may be more advanced, eveningness tendency may be still important and indicative of sleep and psychological disturbance. Psychiatry Investig 2018;15(8):775-782","Sleep disorders in Korea have been steadily increasing. 1 Although sleep disturbances are present in all age groups, the prevalence of sleep disorders in the elderly is high due to the normal aging process as well as comorbidity with various physical and mental disorders. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Advances in the circadian rhythm due to aging affects sleep in the elderly, usually characterized by waking up early and feeling excessively sleepy in the afternoon. Changes in circadian rhythm are a direct cause of sleep disturbance, 3, 10 and are associated with circadian rhythm sleep disorders, especially advanced sleep phase type (ASPS) in the elderly. 11 Chronotype is defined as the sleep-wake time preference based on the individual's circadian rhythm. Previous studies have found that an overall strong preference for eveningness tendencies is associated with higher severity of depression, insomnia and anxiety in all age groups. [12] [13] [14] Consistent findings were also reported in the elderly group, despite having a large proportion of advanced circadian rhythm. 9, 15, 16 Thus, chronotype appears to be an important factor to consider in the elderly in the context of sleep disturbances and psychological factors."
Ehrlichia secretes Etf-1 to induce autophagy and capture nutrients for its growth through RAB5 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that causes a potentially fatal emerging zoonosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis. E. chaffeensis has a limited capacity for biosynthesis and metabolism and thus depends mostly on host-synthesized nutrients for growth. Although the host cell cytoplasm is rich with these nutrients, as E. chaffeensis is confined within the early endosome-like membrane-bound compartment, only host nutrients that enter the compartment can be used by this bacterium. How this occurs is unknown. We found that ehrlichial replication depended on autophagy induction involving class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) activity, BECN1 (Beclin 1), and ATG5 (autophagy-related 5). Ehrlichia acquired host cell preincorporated amino acids in a class III PtdIns3Kdependent manner and ehrlichial growth was enhanced by treatment with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. Moreover, ATG5 and RAB5A/B/C were routed to ehrlichial inclusions. RAB5A/B/C siRNA knockdown, or overexpression of a RAB5-specific GTPase-activating protein or dominant-negative RAB5A inhibited ehrlichial infection, indicating the critical role of GTP-bound RAB5 during infection. Both native and ectopically expressed ehrlichial type IV secretion effector protein, Etf-1, bound RAB5 and the autophagy-initiating class III PtdIns3K complex, PIK3C3/VPS34, and BECN1, and homed to ehrlichial inclusions. Ectopically expressed Etf-1 activated class III PtdIns3K as in E. chaffeensis infection and induced autophagosome formation, cleared an aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin protein in a class III PtdIns3K-dependent manner, and enhanced ehrlichial proliferation. These data support the notion that E. chaffeensis secretes Etf-1 to induce autophagy to repurpose the host cytoplasm and capture nutrients for its growth through RAB5 and class III PtdIns3K, while avoiding autolysosomal killing.","Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a Gram-negative obligatory intracellular bacterium in the family Anaplasmataceae, primarily infects monocytes and macrophages in mammals and causes the emerging tick-borne zoonosis called human monocytic ehrlichiosis. [1] [2] [3] This serious and sometimes fatal disease is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels. [3] [4] [5] One fundamental virulence factor of microbial pathogens is ""nutritional virulence,"" 6 i.e., the ability to acquire nutrients for pathogen proliferation in competition with hosts and possible other microbes. Many pathogens thrive on extracellular nutrients available in the blood and mucosal surface and on the host cellular lysate. However, E. chaffeensis, as an obligatory intracellular bacterium, acquires nutrients inside host cells which are kept alive until bacteria fully proliferate and mature (reviewed in ref. 7) . The host cell-dependency of E. chaffeensis is so extreme that unlike facultative intracellular bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can be cultured axenically, E. chaffeensis cannot replicate or even survive outside of host cells for more than a few hours. The intracellular membrane compartment (inclusion) that contains E. chaffeensis has early endosome-like characteristics, including the small GTPase RAB5, a RAB5 effector EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1), TF (transferrin), TFRC (transferrin receptor), and vacuolar-type H C -ATPase, but it lacks late endosomal or lysosomal markers or NADPH oxidase components. [8] [9] [10] Within this compartment, E. chaffeensis acquires all nutrients for its reproduction to form numerous mature infectious forms. E. chaffeensis has a small genome of 1.176 Mb with a limited capacity for biosynthesis and metabolism. 11 Consequently it must depend mostly on host-synthesized nutrients for replication. Although the host cell cytoplasm is rich with these nutrients, it is unlikely that the inclusion membrane is leaky, as ehrlichial inclusions maintain a weakly acidic intralumenal pH. 8 It is also unlikely that varieties of active transporters are synthesized and assembled in the proper orientation on the inclusion membrane to import host nutrients during ehrlichial replication. Considering these limitations, it is possible that a novel mechanism has evolved in this group of obligatory intracellular bacteria to acquire nutrients."
TITLE (PROVISIONAL) Geographical disparities in emergency department presentations for acute respiratory infections and risk factors for presenting: a population-based cohort study of Western Australian children AUTHORS,VERSION 1 -REVIEW,"to specifically identify the presentation of the ARIs, the major diagnostic category identified ""diseases and disorder of the respiratory system"" was non-specific an accounted for 65.8% of all ARI events in the Aboriginal children and 21.6% of the events in the non-Aboriginal children. Despite this major limitation for linking the diagnosis to the ARI event, Aboriginal children in general had about a 2 to 3-fold higher IRR in most diagnosis for children <12 months of age. This suggest that for Aboriginal children < 12 months of age the incidence rates were highly underestimated for most ARI diagnosis. This concept should be explored in the discussion section. A concern is the lack of information on co-morbid conditions other than prematurity that will impacts ARI visits to the ED. Such comorbid conditions includes diseases in the category of chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neurological diseases, immunodeficiency's, etc. This type of information is generally captured in the ICD-10 codes. If this type of information is not available it should be mentioned as a limitation in the discussion section. Other points. Please clarify if the ICD-10 code was in use from 2002 to 2012 for all the regions studied in WA. The high use of the non-specific respiratory disease category suggest that ICD-10 codes were not implemented consistently overtime, by region and by race. Please address."
"Behaviors, movements, and transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory diseases during transcontinental airline flights","With over 3 billion airline passengers annually, the inflight transmission of infectious diseases is an important global health concern. Over a dozen cases of inflight transmission of serious infections have been documented, and air travel can serve as a conduit for the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and pandemics. Despite sensational media stories and anecdotes, the risks of transmission of respiratory viruses in an airplane cabin are unknown. Movements of passengers and crew may facilitate disease transmission. On 10 transcontinental US flights, we chronicled behaviors and movements of individuals in the economy cabin on single-aisle aircraft. We simulated transmission during flight based on these data. Our results indicate there is low probability of direct transmission to passengers not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger. This data-driven, dynamic network transmission model of droplet-mediated respiratory disease is unique. To measure the true pathogen burden, our team collected 229 environmental samples during the flights. Although eight flights were during Influenza season, all qPCR assays for 18 common respiratory viruses were negative. airplane transportation | infectious disease transmission | influenza |","W ith over 3 billion airline passengers annually, the inflight transmission of infectious diseases is an important global health concern (1).

Cytoplasmic Domains of Cellular and Viral Integral Membrane Proteins Substitute for the Cytoplasmic Domain of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein in Transport to the Plasma Membrane,Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was,"used to construct chimeric cDNAs that encode the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (G) linked to the cytoplasmic domain of either the immunoglobulin u membrane heavy chain, the hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza virus, or the small glycoprotein (023) of infectious bronchitis virus. Biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that these hybrid genes were correctly expressed in eukaryotic cells and that the hybrid proteins were transported to the plasma membrane. The rate of transport to the Golgi complex of G protein with an immunoglobulin # membrane cytoplasmic domain was approximately sixfold slower than G protein with its normal cytoplasmic domain. However, this rate was virtually identical to the rate of transport of ~m heavy chain molecules measured in the B cell line WEHI 231. The rate of transport of G protein with a hemagglutinin cytoplasmic domain was threefold slower than wild type G protein and G protein with a p23 cytoplasmic domain, which were transported at similar rates. The combined results underscore the importance of the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic domain for efficient transport of G protein to the cell surface. Also, normal cytoplasmic domains from other transmembrane glycoproteins can substitute for the G protein cytoplasmic domain in transport of G protein to the plasma membrane. The method of constructing precise hybrid proteins described here will be useful in defining functions of specific domains of viral and cellular integral membrane proteins. I NTEGRAL membrane proteins and secretory proteins are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) I. Signal peptides, required to initiate transfer of nascent polypeptides across the ER during synthesis, have been identified for most eukaryotic secretory and integral membrane proteins thus far examined (7, 51) . Addition of high mannose core oligosaccharides occurs on the cisternal surface of the rough ER during translocation of the nascent chain (49) . Hydrophobic regions of 20-30 amino acids serve to anchor glycoproteins in the membrane.

Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening A R T I C L E H I S T O R Y,The rapid increase in the amount of protein sequence data available leads to an urgent need for novel computational algorithms to analyze and compare these sequences. This study is undertaken to develop an efficient computational approach for timely encoding protein sequences and extracting the hidden information.,"DNA-binding proteins (DNA-BPs) are very important functional proteins in a cell. These proteins play vital roles in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, regulation of gene expression, packaging, and other activities associated with DNA [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . It is therefore substantially important to distinguish DNA-BPs from non-DNA-binding proteins (NBPs). In the past, many experimental and computational techniques have been developed for identifying DNA-BPs. Experimental techniques can provide a clear-cut answer to a query protein. However, the experimental methods are cost-intensive and time-consuming, and thus impractical for large datasets [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Computational methods can be broadly divided into two categories: structure-based method and sequence-based *Address correspondence to this author at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571158, China; Tel: +86-898-65883210; E-mail: lichwun@163.com method. The former can discriminate DNA-binding and nonbinding proteins with high accuracy, but these methods can't be employed in high throughput annotation, as they require the structure information of a query protein [1] . Though tremendous progress has been achieved in experimental determination of protein structures in the past five decades, it can't keep pace with the explosive growth of sequence information resulting from modern sequencing technology [8] . Yet as suggested by Anfinsen [9] , proteins contain within their amino acid sequences enough information to determine their native conformation. Therefore, it is more promising to use sequence-based methods to identify DNA-BPs."
Generation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody against MERS-CoV targeting the spike protein using a synthetic peptide epitope-CpG-DNA-liposome complex,"within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV S protein. We used a complex consisting of the epitope peptide of the MERS-CoV S protein and CpG-DNA encapsulated in liposome complex to immunize mice, and produced the monoclonal antibodies 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2. The western blotting data showed that both monoclonal antibodies detected the S protein and immunoprecipitated the native form of the S protein. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal analysis suggested strong reactivity of the antibodies towards the S protein of MERS-CoV virus infected Vero cells. Furthermore, the 506-2G10G5 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced plaque formation in MERS-CoV infected Vero cells compared to normal mouse IgG and 492-1G10E4E2. Thus, we successfully produced a monoclonal antibody directed against the RBD domain of the S protein which could be used in the development of diagnostics and therapeutic applications in the future.

Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals HIV-1-Mediated Suppression of T Cell Activation and RNA Processing and Regulation of Noncoding RNA Expression in a CD4 ؉ T Cell Line,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables the highly sensitive measurement of whole transcriptomes. We report the first application to our knowledge of this technology to the analysis of RNA from a CD4 ؉ T cell line infected with intact HIV. We sequenced the total mRNA from infected cells and detected differences in the expression of both host and viral mRNA. Viral reads represented a large portion of the total mapped sequencing reads: approximately 20% at 12 h postinfection (hpi) and 40% at 24 hpi. We also detected a small but significant suppression of T cell activation-related genes at 12 hpi. This suppression persisted and expanded by 24 hpi, providing new possible markers of virus-induced T cell cytopathology. By 24 hpi, the expression of over 50% of detectable host loci was also altered, indicating widespread alteration of host processes, including RNA processing, splicing, and transport to an extent not previously reported. In addition, next-generation sequencing provided insights into alternative viral RNA splice events and the expression of noncoding RNAs, including microRNA host genes.","T he hallmark of AIDS is the loss of CD4 ϩ T cells, the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Infected CD4 ϩ T cells undergo fundamental changes that eventually result in cell death and the release of new virus particles (reviewed in references 1 and 2). Following the uptake of virus, the viral genome is reverse transcribed and integrated into the host genome. The host machinery is then used to produce viral transcripts that are either spliced into smaller transcripts that serve as the template for viral proteins or left unspliced to be incorporated into new virus particles. Microarray analyses have shown that infected cells respond to these assaults with gene expression changes in a number of pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle, cholesterol biosynthesis, and inflammation (3) (4) (5) ; reference 1 and references therein)."
Selective redox regulation of cytokine receptor signaling by extracellular thioredoxin-1,"The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is known to be secreted by leukocytes and to exhibit cytokine-like properties. Extracellular effects of Trx1 require a functional active site, suggesting a redox-based mechanism of action. However, specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far. Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals. Furthermore, we confirm that Trx1 affects CD30dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. Thus, we conclude that receptor-ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by an extracellular redox catalyst.","Disulfide bonds have long been recognized as structural elements stabilizing proteins in harsh extracellular environments. More recently, an additional concept has emerged: some disulfide bonds operate as dynamic scaffolds capable of regulated rearrangement into a variety of functional forms (Jordan and Gibbins, 2006) . Consistent with this notion, various cell surface processes have long been known to depend on catalyzed thiol-disulfide exchange including cell adhesion (Essex, 2004) , uptake of bacterial toxins (de Paiva et al, 1993) and viral fusion with the host membrane (Sanders, 2000) . Moreover, a variety of cell surface signaling receptors appear to exist in more than one thiol-disulfide configuration, for example CD28 (Greene et al, 1996) . However, in most cases, neither the catalyst driving thioldisulfide exchange nor the functional differences between the redox forms have been elucidated."
Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency enhances germ cell apoptosis and causes defective embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, known as favism, is classically manifested by hemolytic anemia in human. More recently, it has been shown that mild G6PD deficiency moderately affects cardiac function, whereas severe G6PD deficiency leads to embryonic lethality in mice. How G6PD deficiency affects organisms has not been fully elucidated due to the lack of a suitable animal model. In this study, G6PD-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans was established by RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown to delineate the role of G6PD in animal physiology. Upon G6PD RNAi knockdown, G6PD activity was significantly hampered in C. elegans in parallel with increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. Phenotypically, G6PD-knockdown enhanced germ cell apoptosis (2-fold increase), reduced egg production (65% of mock), and hatching (10% of mock). To determine whether oxidative stress is associated with G6PD knockdown-induced reproduction defects, C. elegans was challenged with a short-term hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The early phase egg production of both mock and G6PD-knockdown C. elegans were significantly affected by H 2 O 2 . However, H 2 O 2 -induced germ cell apoptosis was more dramatic in mock than that in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in defective oogenesis and embryogenesis caused by G6PD knockdown, mutants of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3-and 9.6fold increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C. elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and altered MAPK pathways, respectively.","susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-induced senescence. 11 The susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cytotoxic effect in G6PD-depleted cells is a recurring theme. Recently, G6PD-knockdown HepG2 cells have been shown to be highly susceptible to diamide-induced cytotoxicity with concomitant increased membrane peroxidation and cytoskeletal protein aggregation. 12 Such enhanced susceptibility to diamide-induced oxidative stress has been attributed mainly to impaired glutathione regeneration. These observations suggest that G6PD-deficient cells are predisposed to imbalanced redox status and oxidative stress. As a result, the increased oxidative stress elicits oxidative damage in macromolecules, such as DNA, protein, and lipid. Indeed, elevated DNA oxidative damage is found in G6PD-deficient fibroblasts, 11 and such cumulative genotoxic insult impairs cell growth. 17 The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is involved in coordinating the response to oxidative stress, 18 thereby modulating cellular events including proliferation, differentiation, stress adaptation, and apoptosis. Recently, it has been shown that G6PD-knockdown human HepG2 cells are sensitive to oxidant-induced apoptosis due to altered MAPK signaling pathway. 13 Although much progress have been made on understanding the cellular effects of G6PD deficiency in erythrocytes and nucleated cells, the role of G6PD at the level of multicellular organism has not been investigated extensively due to the lack of G6PD-deficient animal model. The free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is the first multicellular animal with its genome being fully sequenced 19 and the C. elegans G6PD protein shows 56% amino-acid sequence homology with the human counterpart. In addition, the advantages of using C. elegans, including short life span, ease for large-scale culture, transparent body for microscopic examination, and readily frozen for storage as well as tractable genetic system, make it an invaluable animal model for G6PD research as well as other biomedical research. [20] [21] [22] In the present study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown technique to establish a reproducible G6PDdeficient C. elegans animal model. Such G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displayed defective oogenesis (increased apoptotic germ cells and reduced egg production) with concomitant increase of oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. Most importantly, we have found that G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displayed a severe defect in embryogenesis as indicated by a dramatic reduction of hatching of the embryos from these animals. Mechanistically, the reduced egg production and defective hatching induced by G6PD deficiency could be attributed partly to increased oxidative stress and possibly mediated by altered MAPK pathways in C. elegans, respectively."
Detection of Common Respiratory Viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Patient-Occupied Rooms in Pediatric Wards,Few studies have assessed viral contamination in the rooms of hospital wards. This cross-sectional study evaluated the air and objects in patient-occupied rooms in pediatric wards for the presence of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.,"T ypical hospital air quality indices are temperature, relative humidity, 1 and levels of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, 2,3 toxic metals, 3 volatile organic compounds, 1 bacteria, 2,4-6 fungi, 5, 7, 8 and viruses. 9 Previous studies of air quality primarily focused on intensive care units, 4, 7, 10, 11 operating rooms, 12, 13 negative-pressure patient isolation rooms, 6, 9 and public areas in hospitals. 3, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] However, few studies assessed viral contamination in the patients' rooms in a given hospital ward."
Ar ticle Type I IFN promotes NK cell expansion during viral infection by protecting NK cells against fratricide,"Given the pleiotropic effects of type I IFNs (Uzé et al., 2007) , we assessed the ability of Ifnar −/− and WT Ly49H + NK cells to expand in response to MCMV infection using an adoptive cotransfer system (Sun et al., 2012) where both transferred NK cell populations respond against virus and experience similar inflammatory cues within the same host environment. WT and Ifnar −/− NK cells were cotransferred into Ly49H-deficient mice, whose NK cells are unable to recognize the virus-encoded glycoprotein m157 during MCMV infection and undergo clonal expansion (Sun et al., 2009) . In contrast to the WT NK cells that robustly expanded after MCMV infection, Ifnar −/− NK cells failed to expand robustly ( Fig. 1 A) . Although they exhibited an expansion defect, Ifnar −/− NK","Type I IFNs provide a potent line of antiviral defense through direct and indirect effects on cells of the immune system, leading to their activation and effector function (Biron, 2001; González-Navajas et al., 2012) and resulting in the attenuation of viral replication (Müller et al., 1994) . IFN-α and IFN-β are members of the type I IFN family. All members of the type I IFN family signal through a ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric receptor that is composed of the IFN-α receptor 1 (IFN AR1) and IFN AR2 chains. Type I IFNs act directly on NK cells to promote their activation, cell cycle entry, and cytotoxic function during viral infection (Biron et al., 1984; Orange and Biron, 1996; Biron, 2001; Nguyen et al., 2002; Martinez et al., 2008; Baranek et al., 2012; Fortin et al., 2013) . However, the experimental systems used in previous studies-direct infection of IFN receptor-deficient mice or WT mice with IFN neutralization-are complicated by potential differences in the degree of inflammation, effects on many cell types, and viral load. Thus, the direct influence of type I IFN on effector and long-lived antiviral NK cell responses, while eliminating pleotropic effects on other cells, has not been investigated previously."
Current status of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) in European pigs,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a highly contagious and devastating enteric disease of pigs caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. The disease is clinically similar to other forms of porcine gastroenteritis. Pigs are the only known host of the disease, and the occurrence of PED in wild boars is unknown. The virus causes acute diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in suckling piglets reaching 100%. Heavy economic losses in the pig-farming industry were sustained in the USA between 2013 and 2015 when PEDV spread very quickly and resulted in epidemics. The loss in the US pig industry has been estimated at almost seven million pigs. The purpose of this review is a description of the current status of porcine epidemic diarrhoea in European pigs and the risk presented by the introduction of PEDV to Poland in comparison to the epidemics in the USA.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause a large variety of diseases in humans and animals. In pigs, coronaviruses affect various organs, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. CoVs have one of the largest genomes of all RNA viruses, which in combination with their high genetic diversity causes mutation and recombination, resulting in new virus variants (24) . Besides porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), the porcine coronaviruses comprise transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (26) . The clinical symptoms of PED are diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration which result in very high mortality among suckling piglets and large economic losses (5, 8, 21) . Various factors influence the clinical signs of PED, mainly the age of the animals, the herd's immune status, and the virulence of the strain (18) . Multiple PEDV strains are circulating on different pig farms around the world and they differ in virulence."
On the stability of sequences inserted into viral genomes,"Viruses are widely used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or natural hosts, and therefore a large number of viruses with exogenous sequences inserted into their genomes have been engineered. Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy.","A large number of virus genomes have been engineered to carry additional sequences for a variety of purposes. Viruses are often used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or the natural host. For example, the baculovirus expression system is widely used for expression work (Chambers et al. 2018 ), lentiviruses show great promise for gene therapy (Milone and O'Doherty 2018) , and phage display allows for selection of desired epitopes (Wu et al. 2016) . Marker genes have also been built into viruses to facilitate tracking infection spread (Dolja, McBride, and Carrington 1992) . As viruses evolve rapidly, including the incorporation of genome-rearrangements, it is therefore unsurprising that the insertion of sequences into viral genomes often goes hand in hand with the rapid occurrence of deletions (Koonin, Dolja, and Morris 1993; Pijlman et al. 2001; Zwart et al. 2014 ). The inserted sequence, and sometimes parts of the viral genome, are then rapidly lost. This genomic instability can have economic ramifications, leading to decreases in heterologous protein expression (Kool et al. 1991; De Gooijer et al. 1992; Scholthof, Scholthof, V C The Author(s) 2019.

It can also introduce limitations and complications to working with marker genes Majer, Darò s, and Zwart 2013) . Understanding the stability of inserted sequences therefore has value from an applied perspective, but it could also shed light on basic questions. First, how stable are natural virus genomes, and under what conditions do they become unstable? Second, since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in virus evolution, under what conditions are transferred sequences likely to be retained?"
"Identification, Characterization, and In Vitro Culture of Highly Divergent Arenaviruses from Boa Constrictors and Annulated Tree Boas: Candidate Etiological Agents for Snake Inclusion Body Disease","Inclusion body disease (IBD) is an infectious fatal disease of snakes typified by behavioral abnormalities, wasting, and secondary infections. At a histopathological level, the disease is identified by the presence of large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple tissues. To date, no virus or other pathogen has been definitively characterized or associated with the disease. Using a metagenomic approach to search for candidate etiologic agents in snakes with confirmed IBD, we identified and de novo assembled the complete genomic sequences of two viruses related to arenaviruses, and a third arenavirus-like sequence was discovered by screening an additional set of samples. A continuous boa constrictor cell line was established and used to propagate and isolate one of the viruses in culture. Viral nucleoprotein was localized and concentrated within large cytoplasmic inclusions in infected cells in culture and tissues from diseased snakes. In total, viral RNA was detected in 6/8 confirmed IBD cases and 0/18 controls. These viruses have a typical arenavirus genome organization but are highly divergent, belonging to a lineage separate from that of the Old and New World arenaviruses. Furthermore, these viruses encode envelope glycoproteins that are more similar to those of filoviruses than to those of other arenaviruses. These findings implicate these viruses as candidate etiologic agents of IBD. The presence of arenaviruses outside mammals reveals that these viruses infect an unexpectedly broad range of species and represent a new reservoir of potential human pathogens.","idly than do boas, which may survive for months or years after symptom onset if provided with supportive care. Although there is evidence that IBD is transmissible, the precise mode of transmission is unknown (3) . Conclusive identification of an etiologic agent or agents has the potential to enable IBD treatments, vaccines, diagnostics, and prevention policies."
DIFFERENTIATION OF BOVINE CORONAVIRUS (BCoV) GENOTYPES BY A RESTRICTION ENZYME ASSAY,"This article reports the use of the GsuI restriction enzyme to differentiate genotypes of Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV), based on an 18-nucleotide deletion of S1-coding region found in one of the two genotypes.

EMBO (Eur,"The membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains of CD4 and CD8 were replaced by those of TGN38. After transient expression in HeLa cells, the location of the hybrid proteins was determined using immunofluorescence and quantitative immuno-electron microscopy, FACS analysis and metabolic labeling. The membrane-spanning domain was found to contain a signal that localized hybrid proteins to the TGN. This was in addition to the signal previously identified in the cytoplasmic domain (Bos, K., C.

Some membrane proteins contain a double-lysine motif in the cytoplasmic tail which ensures retrieval to the ER (Jackson et al., 1993) ."
Necrotizing Enteritis Caused by Pharyngostomum cordatum Infection in a Stray Cat,"A stray female cat of unknown age, presenting bright red watery diarrhea, was submitted to the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency for diagnosis. In the small intestines extracted from the necropsied cat, numerous white ovalshaped organisms were firmly embedded in the mucosa and there was thickening of intestinal wall. Histopathological analysis revealed severe necrotizing enteritis, together with atrophied intestinal villi, exfoliated enterocytes, and parasitic worms. Recovered worms were identified as Pharyngostomum cordatum by morphological observation and genetic analysis. Although P. cordatum is known to occur widely in Korea, this is the first clinical description of an infection by P. cordatum causing severe feline enteritis.","Enteritis in cats is caused by infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, and parasites), with parasites being the primary cause of diarrhea, especially among strays. Intestinal helminths (e.g., nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes) have been identified in the feline alimentary system [1] . Within the trematodes, 26 species have been detected in cats in Korea: 10 species by 2000 [2] [3] [4] [5] , 15 species in 2005 [6] , and 1 species in 2009 [7] . The intestinal trematode Neodiplostomum seoulense (formerly Fibricola seoulensis), which is closely related to Pharyngostomum cordatum (Digenea: Diplostomidae), causes serious diarrhea and enteritis in human and laboratory animals, including rats and mice [8] . The snake, Rhabdophis tigrina, serves as a second intermediate host of these 2 species of trematode [9] . P. cordatum infects carnivorous mammals worldwide. Domestic and wild cats act as the definitive hosts of this fluke, whose adults parasitize the small intestines of cats. The intermediate hosts, from which the parasite infects cats, are tad-poles, frogs, and frog-eating animals, including certain snakes [10] . Infection by this fluke in cats has been widely reported in Germany, Romania, China, Japan, and India [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In the Republic of Korea (Korea), P. cordatum was first recovered in the small intestines of cats from Seoul [16] . The prevalence of this fluke in cats in Korea has been reported [6, 17] . However, no studies have described the pathology of P. cordatum infection in domestic felines. Here, we present the first clinical case of necrotizing enteritis caused by this fluke in a stray cat in Korea."
The Journal of Experimental Medicine Protective immune responses against West Nile virus are primed by distinct complement activation pathways,"Prior studies have shown that complement plays a critical role in controlling WNV infection in complement (C) 3 −/− and complement receptor 1/2 −/− mice. Here, we dissect the contributions of the individual complement activation pathways to the protection from WNV disease. Genetic defi ciencies in C1q, C4, factor B, or factor D all resulted in increased mortality in mice, suggesting that all activation pathways function together to limit WNV spread. In the absence of alternative pathway complement activation, WNV disseminated into the central nervous system at earlier times and was associated with reduced CD8 + T cell responses yet near normal anti-WNV antibody profi les.","The complement system is a family of more than 30 proteins and cell surface receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, altered-self ligands, or immune complexes. Complement activation through the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways induces several protective functions including direct pathogen opsonization and/or lysis, and enhancement of B and T responses (1) . Through these innate and adaptive responses complement contributes to the development of immunity against some enveloped DNA and RNA viruses (2) (3) (4) (5) . Several of these viruses have been shown to trigger distinct pathways of complement activation in vitro. Glycoproteins of murine leukemia, HIV, and human T cell lymphotropic viruses directly interact with C1q to activate the classical pathway (6) . Carbohydrates on the structural proteins of HSV, hepatitis B, and infl uenza viruses bind mannose binding lectins (MBLs) and activate the lectin pathway (7, 8) . Multiple viruses activate the alternative pathway, including Sindbis (9) , Sendai (10), measles (11, 12) , and Epstein Barr viruses (13) . However, the in vivo contribution of each complement activation pathway to the development of antiviral immunity has yet to be defi ned."
"Incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in the Jiangsu province of China, 20082011",Background: It is important to have an estimate of the incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) because the incidence of ADEM is unknown and the outcomes undefined in China.,"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) disorder. 1 It is characterized by an acute encephalopathy with polyfocal neurological deficits. In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of widespread demyelination, after ruling out other possible explanations for an acute encephalopathy. 2 In 2007 the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Study Group proposed a consensus definition for ADEM for application in research and clinical settings. 3 The pathogenesis of ADEM is not fully known, but adhesion molecules, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinase, and other cell factors can play important roles in its occurrence and development. 4 Formerly, ADEM occurred particularly often in children with measles. However, the disease most often follows a nondescript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. Many identifiable infections have been associated with ADEM, such as measles, mumps, rubella, coxsackie, coronavirus, herpes, influenza A and B, hepatitis A and B, human T-lymphotropic virus-1, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus, or smallpox. 5 In addition to a known association with infections, vaccinations (e.g. rabies, smallpox or measles vaccines) have also been suggested to increase the risk of ADEM. 6 There have been many recent studies showing no long-term association between vaccinations and ADEM. 7 In recent years, the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has been carried out in China. The type and number of vaccines administered to residents were expanded. The probability of having an abnormal reaction such as ADEM to vaccines is small, but the occurrences of such reactions increased after the EPI, causing widespread public concern. This may reduce public confidence in vaccines. When evaluating the risk of vaccines leading to ADEM or when judging whether ADEM has a causal association with vaccination, epidemiological features and population-level baseline incidence rates, in addition to clinical characteristics and disease diagnosis, must be assessed. A firm measure of the incidence of ADEM is increasingly important."
A New Quaternary Structure Epitope on Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Is the Target of Durable Type-Specific Neutralizing Antibodies,"Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) is widespread and responsible for severe epidemics. While primary DENV2 infections stimulate serotype-specific protective responses, a leading vaccine failed to induce a similar protective response. Using human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) isolated from dengue cases and structure-guided design of a chimeric DENV, here we describe the major site on the DENV2 envelope (E) protein targeted by neutralizing antibodies. DENV2-specific neutralizing hMAb 2D22 binds to a quaternary structure epitope. We engineered and recovered a recombinant DENV4 that displayed the 2D22 epitope. DENV2 neutralizing antibodies in people exposed to infection or a live vaccine tracked with the 2D22 epitope on the DENV4/2 chimera. The chimera remained sensitive to DENV4 antibodies, indicating that the major neutralizing epitopes on DENV2 and -4 are at different sites. The ability to transplant a complex epitope between DENV serotypes demonstrates a hitherto underappreciated structural flexibility in flaviviruses, which could be harnessed to develop new vaccines and diagnostics. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus causes fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue serotype 2 (DENV2) is widespread and frequently responsible for severe epidemics. Natural DENV2 infections stimulate serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, but a leading DENV vaccine did not induce a similar protective response. While groups have identified epitopes of single monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), the molecular basis of DENV2 neutralization by polyclonal human immune sera is unknown. Using a recombinant DENV displaying serotype 2 epitopes, here we map the main target of DENV2 polyclonal neutralizing antibodies induced by natural infection and a live DENV2 vaccine candidate. Proper display of the epitope required the assembly of viral envelope proteins into higher-order structures present on intact virions. Despite the complexity of the epitope, it was possible to transplant the epitope between DENV serotypes. Our findings have immediate implications for evaluating dengue vaccines in the pipeline as well as designing next-generation vaccines. AM, Baric RS. 2015. A new quaternary structure epitope on dengue virus serotype 2 is the target of durable type-specific neutralizing antibodies. mBio 6(5):e01461-15.","D engue virus (DENV) is the most significant arboviral infection of humans, with an estimated 390 million infections and 96 million symptomatic cases annually (1) . The DENV complex consists of four distinct serotypes (DENV1 to -4). Infection with one serotype induces long-term protective immunity to the homologous serotype only. In fact, immunity to one serotype is associated with an increased risk of severe disease upon subsequent infection with a different serotype, a confounding factor for vaccine design. Many dengue vaccines in clinical trials are tetravalent live-attenuated virus formulations that are designed to simultaneously induce protective immunity to all 4 serotypes (2) (3) (4) . However, in phase 3 efficacy trials in Asia and Latin America, the leading vaccine was 50 to 78% efficacious against serotypes 1, 3, and 4 but only 35 to 42% efficacious against serotype 2 (5, 6) . Moreover, in vaccinees less than 5 years of age, incidence of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue was~8-fold higher than that seen in matched nonvaccinated controls, demonstrating a critical need for new metrics of protective immunity (7) . Here we describe the main site on DENV2 recognized by type-specific and durable neutralizing antibodies in people and other primates exposed to natural infections or a candidate live attenuated DENV2 vaccine."
Does spatial proximity drive norovirus transmission during outbreaks in hospitals?,"Objective: To assess the role of spatial proximity, defined as patients sharing bays, in the spread of norovirus during outbreaks in hospitals. Design: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011.","Norovirus is the commonest cause of gastrointestinal infection worldwide. 1 There are between two and three million cases occurring each year in the UK. 2 3 Norovirus commonly presents as outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting and are frequently reported in hospitals, care-homes, schools and cruise ships. 4 5 Outbreaks in hospitals are disruptive, often leading to ward or bay closures, staff sickness and cancelled operations. 6 The cost of nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus to the National Health Service (NHS) in England was estimated at £115 million in 2002/2003. 6 Recently the cost in one region in Scotland was estimated at £1.2 million in the two norovirus seasons from 2007 to 2008. 7 Understanding the benefits of infection control measures is challenging, because they are usually instigated as a package with several measures being implemented during an outbreak. While these interventions are based on sound infection control principles, "
Ciliocytophthoria of nasal epithelial cells after viral infection: a sign of suffering cell,"Ciliocytophthoria (CCP) defines a degenerative process of the ciliated cells consequent to viral infections, and it is characterized by typical morphological changes. We evaluated the distinct and characteristic phases of CCP, by means of the optical microscopy of the nasal mucosa (nasal cytology), in 20 patients (12 males and 8 females; aged between 18 and 40 years). Three phases of CCP by nasal cytology are detected. This outcome confirms that CCP represents a sign of suffering nasal epithelial cell. (www.actabiomedica.it)","It is well known that the term ciliocytophthoria defines a degenerative process of the ciliated cells consequent to viral infections, and it is characterized by typical morphological changes. Joseph Leidy firstly described asmathosis ciliaris in samples recovered from asthmatic patients: i.e. damaged respiratory cells (1) . Later, Hilding reported aberrant nasal cells similar to parasitic cells (2) . Papanicolau coined the term ciliocytophthoria (CCP) to identify the degenerative process in the bronchial ciliated cells observed during virosis and bronchial carcinoma (3) . After that, other terms (pseudoprotozoa and ""pseudomicrobe"") were used rather than CCP. It confirms the confusion between degenerative process of ciliated cells and flagellated protozoa frequently found in airways (4-7). Further, electron microscopy exactly characterized CCP and allowd to correctly include it into the degenerative phenomena during respiratory infections (8, 9) ."
One Health in China,"As a result of rapid economic growth over the previous three decades, China has become the second largest economy worldwide since 2010. However, as a developing country with the largest population, this rapid economic growth primarily based on excessive consumption and waste of resources. Thus, China has been facing particularly severe ecological and environmental problems in speeding up industrialization and urbanization. The impact of the health risk factors is complex and difficult to accurately predict. Therefore, it is critical to investigate potential threats in the context of the human-animal-environment interface to protect human and animal health. The ''One Health'' concept recognizes that human health is connected to animal and environmental health. This review primarily discusses specific health problems in China, particularly zoonoses, and explains the origin and development of the One Health approach, as well as the importance of a holistic approach in China.","C onsistent with the basic national policy of economic development as the central task, in combination with population growth,urbanization and industrial expansion, high energy consumption and serious pollution have made the ecological system more fragile in China. In the previous three decades, the contradictions among the environment, resources and economic growth have become increasingly prominent. The natural ecology has deteriorated,which not only restricts the long-term economic development but also impacts human interests and even threatens the survival of mankind. The balance between economic development and ecological conservation in China has become a critical issue in recent decades (1) . Visible effects, such as emerging infectious diseases, SARS and MERS, indicate the necessity for close collaborations which is the advocacy by One Health include the national and local government, nongovernment agency, academia, research institute, interdisciplinary science community, the private sector, civil society and other stakeholder. One Health is a interdisciplinary approach suited to address health issues at the human-animal-environment interface (2) . One Health and Ecohealth (Ecosystem health), another holistic approach, despite the different origins, they appear to have increasing alignment regarding the aspects of vision and goals in recent years. However, compared with Ecohealth, One Health focuses more on network building, that's why we only focus on One Health here."
Emergency treatment and nursing of children with severe pneumonia complicated by heart failure and respiratory failure: 10 case reports,"Pneumonia refers to lung inflammation caused by different pathogens or other factors, and is a common pediatric disease occurring in infants and young children. It is closely related to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of infants and young children and is more frequent during winter and spring, or sudden changes in temperature. Pneumonia is a serious disease that poses a threat to children's health and its morbidity and mortality rank first, accounting for 24.5-65.2% of pediatric inpatients. Due to juvenile age, severe illness and rapid changes, children often suffer acute heart failure, respiratory failure and even toxic encephalopathy at the same time. The concurrence in different stages of the process of emergency treatment tends to relapse, which directly places the lives of these children at risk. Severe pneumonia constitutes one of the main causes of infant mortality. In the process of nursing children with severe pneumonia, intensive care was provided, including condition assessment and diagnosis, close observation of disease, keeping the airway unblocked, rational oxygen therapy, prevention and treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure, support of vital organs, complications, and health education. The inflammatory response was proactively controlled, to prevent suffocation and reduce mortality. In summary, positive and effective nursing can promote the rehabilitation of children patients, which can be reinforced with adequate communication with the parents and/or caretakers.","Severe pneumonia is a common life-threatening disease, particularly for children, and is more common in infants and young children (1, 2) . The estimated worldwide incidence of severe pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age is 50-80 per 1,000 person-years and the mortality is 1.0-5.5 per 1,000 person-years (3) (4) (5) . It often occurs in the winter and spring, with acute onset, complex clinical manifestations and fast-changing condition, which usually involves the circulation, nervous and digestive systems (1) (2) (3) . As a result, severe pneumonia produces corresponding clinical symptoms, such as respiratory failure, heart failure, toxic encephalopathy and intestinal paralysis, which endanger the lives of children in the short term, and is the first cause of death of pediatric inpatients (6, 7) . It is listed as the one of the four diseases requiring prevention and treatment in children by the Ministry of Health (8, 9) ."
Analysis of interactions between SNARE proteins using imaging ellipsometer coupled with microfluidic array,"The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins are small and abundant membrane-bound proteins, whose specific interactions mediate membrane fusion during cell fusion or cellular trafficking. In this study, we report the use of a label-free method, called imaging ellipsometer to analyze the interactions among three SNAREs, namely Sec22p, Ykt6p and Sso2p. The SNAREs were immobilized on the silicon wafer and then analyzed in a pairwise mode with microfluidic array, leading us to discover the interactions between Ykt6p and Sso2p, Sec22p and Sso2p. Moreover, by using the real-time function of the imaging ellipsometer, we were able to obtain their association constants (K A ) of about 10 4 M 21 . We argue that the use of imaging ellipsometer coupled with microfluidic device will deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane fusion process.","that imaging ellipsometer enables quantitative, label-free, rapid, high-throughput and low-cost analysis of biological interactions."
China-Africa Health Development Initiatives: Benefits and Implications for Shaping Innovative and Evidence-informed National Health Policies and Programs in Sub-saharan African Countries,"This review paper examines the growing implications of China's engagement in shaping innovative national initiatives against infectious diseases and poverty control and elimination in African countries. It seeks to understand the factors and enhancers that can promote mutual and innovative health development initiatives, and those that are necessary in generating reliable and quality data for evidence-based contextual policy, priorities and programs.","In a rapidly globalizing world with increasing health and epidemiologic transitions, the international community and multilateralism have become highly active, coordinated and robust. The effectiveness of these initiatives depends on the effectiveness of regional and international cooperation on health challenges and issues. [1] There are, however, little substantive information and knowledge gaps on how international cooperation and activities can best be used as tools for the management of global health and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). [1, 2] China-Africa heath development initiatives is timely to address public health and health research gaps, South-South health development platforms and cooperation in shaping innovative national health evidence policies, priorities, programs and benefits in developing countries. International bilateral or multilateral cooperation on health development has been evolving rapidly since the late twentieth century to meet the increasing needs of vulnerable populations, moving forward effective Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and SDGs. [2, 3] In addition, to face the challenges of health and epidemiologic transitions, ageing and globalization challenges, collaborative diplomacy on health security have become more vital than ever in not only saving lives and improving public health but also in improving and providing long lasting benefits to both world's poorest and developed countries. At the same time, however, the rising concern on response and funding from international health actors (WHO, World Bank, UN/UNDP, etc.) remains challenging and requires more efforts and collaboration in harmonizing multilateral efforts and timely actions in emergencies situations. [4, 5] While the news have often reported on the growth of Chinese involvement in Africa, there has been very little literature on its effects on public health. There is a need for deeper analysis on China's cooperation and efforts at improving public health large-scale development in Africa. There are no statistics showing declines in mortality or disease burden. Furthermore, it's still unclear exactly how the Chinese approach differs from the Western approach, as the difference between the ""horizontal"" and ""vertical"" approaches are never described practically or operationally. [3, 4, 6] Moreover, there is an urgent need to understand factors that can promote mutual and beneficial health development initiatives. [2, 3] The growing trend and quest for Chinese multilateral cooperation is increasingly paramount and imperative in tackling the persistent global financial crisis, reducing mass unemployment, and revamping the public burden of infectious diseases of poverty. [4, 5] Strategic and timely China-Africa health development cooperation is much needed in training and capacity development, exchanges, technical assistance and technology transfer. Also, strengthening health systems in scaling up health and medical skills transfer to achieve universal coverage, health equity and overall long-term benefits of improved quality healthcare delivery towards sustainable national development and growth. [2, 3, 6] Reciprocally, to support China in meeting up with the growing demand on natural resources and citizenry needs, international laws and declarations are critical areas for international cooperation. The current political environment and commitment to address health problems has created unprecedented opportunities for bilateral health cooperation. [4, 5] Furthermore, as China has become an increasingly important part of global health over the past decades, interest in China's international health cooperation has increased among public health professionals internationally and in China. [3, 5, 6] Thus, this systematic analysis of China-Africa cooperation is timely in leveraging on infectious diseases and poverty alleviation health experiences and lessons learned in reshaping strategic health diplomacy formulation and enhancing successful approaches in health programs and networks in Africa. [5, 7] The importance of international, multilateral cooperation for health and disease prevention and control has been recognized as a vital approach and instrument in global health agenda. However, there is a dearth of literature on the potential impact of China strategic diplomacy and policy approaches on the global health inter-dependence, focusing mainly on aspects of existing and emerging threats from disease prevention and control to elimination programs and strategies. [6, 8] Few scholarly publications have paid attention to the behavior and politics of global actors. Primarily, how China-Africa health development will shape the global health priorities cooperation and collaboration requires further investigation. [4] [5] [6] [7] In China, there exists a few articles regarding international cooperation on health concerns aspects of social science. [2, 6, 7] To address the operational and translation research to health policy and practice gaps, challenges and opportunities, more systematic analyses might be required in further understanding the importance of strategic and comprehensive engagement. [4, 7, 8] Jointly and mutually beneficial Africa-China heath development initiatives could be the turning point for collaborative support and research projects, resource sharing and analysis for new public health policy dimensions and strategic impact. Programmatic and robust partnerships are paramount in fostering context health and sustainable public health innovations for health information for all generations. It will, in turn, impact on communities and populations, fostering efficient and effective global health initiatives towards enhanced economic trade, growth and stability, promoting the course of human rights and equity, reinforcement of environmental and wildlife protection and regulations, access and use of health services and medical commodities in achieving UHC and mainstreaming of the SDGs. [8, 9] This review paper examines the implications of China engagement in global health initiatives in Africa particularly as it relates to the benefits in health systems strengthening and innovations, emerging epidemics and infectious diseases of poverty initiatives prevention, control and elimination. It seeks an understanding of the drivers and operational enhancers that can promote innovative health development initiatives necessary for reliable and quality data for evidencebased contextual policy, priorities and programs of global health impact."
MINI REVIEW ARTICLE Mouse hepatitis virus receptor as a determinant of the mouse susceptibility to MHV infection,"In this review, we report that the receptor of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), is an important determinant of mouse susceptibility to MHV infection. This finding was revealed by using mouse strains with two different allelic forms of the MHV receptor, Ceacam1a and Ceacam1b. Although previous studies indicated that susceptibility is determined by a single gene, Ceacam1, our recent work in gene-replaced mice with chimeric Ceacam1 pointed toward the involvement of other host factors (genes) in the susceptibility. Studies on mouse susceptibility to MHV, as well as the factors involved in their susceptibility, are overviewed.","Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a murine coronavirus which causes a wide range of diseases in the mouse and rat, including hepatitis, enteritis, respiratory diseases, and encephalomyelitis in the central nervous system (Wege et al., 1982) . There are also great differences in tissue tropism and virulence among various strains and isolates of MHV (Hirano et al., 1981; Wege et al., 1982) . Complex factors, such as age and immunological status of the host animal, dose, and route of virus inoculation, affect disease outcomes Hirano et al., 1981) . Naturally occurring cases of MHV infections in mouse colonies are generally enteric infections that are not highly pathogenic to immunocompetent adult mice, while virus infections are mostly of a persistent nature (Ishida et al., 1978; Homberger, 1997) . Viruses shed in the feces from persistently infected mice are a source of acute and chronic fatal diseases encountered in mice prone to MHV infection, e.g., diarrhea of suckling mice and wasting syndrome in immunodeficient nude mice (Hirano et al., 1975; Tamura et al., 1977; Ishida et al., 1978) . Thus, the asymptomatic infection of adult mice is a major problem in animal facilities where MHV-free mice are used for experiments and evokes serious problems in terms of maintaining animals of sufficient quality to allow scientists to perform experiments with high reproducibility and reliability."

"Veterinary Science pISSN 1229-845X, eISSN 1976-555X","The protective efficacy of DNA plasmids encoding avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S1, N, or M protein was investigated in chickens. Chickens were inoculated monovalently (with plasmid pVAX1-16S1, pVAX1-16M, or pVAX1-16N alone) or multivalently (combination of the three different plasmids, pVAX1-16S1/M/N). A prime-boost immunization protocol against IBV was developed. Chickens were immunized with the multivalent DNA vaccine twice and then boosted with an inactivated vaccine once. Antibody titers of the chickens immunized with pVAX1-16S1/M/N were much higher than those of the monovalent groups (p ＜ 0.01). A protective rate up to 90% was observed in the pVAX1-16S1/M/N group. The serum antibody titers in the prime-boost birds were significantly higher than those of the multivalent DNA vaccine group (p ＜ 0.01) but not significantly different compared to the inactivated vaccine group at 49 days of age. Additionally, the prime-boost group also showed the highest level of IBV-specific cellular proliferation compared to the monovalent groups (p ＜ 0.01) but no significant difference was found compared to the multivalent DNA vaccine group, and the prime-boost group completely protected from followed viral challenge.","Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a major disease in the poultry industry worldwide. This disease frequently occurs in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks, and has caused severe economic loss over the last few years [11] [12] [13] [14] 17, 21] . Protection failure is mainly due to the numerous IB virus (IBV) serotypes and frequent emergence of new variants [23, 26] . Given the economic effects of IBV on the commercial poultry industry, preventing infection with this virus has been continually pursued. Traditional IBV vaccines include inactivated or live attenuated vaccines [2] [3] [4] . However, both types of vaccines have unique disadvantages. Inactivated vaccines can induce the production of relatively high antibody titers but a very low level of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [5] . Live attenuated vaccines can initiate humoral and cellular immune responses, but lead to the spread the live vaccine viruses [7, 15] . It is therefore necessary to develop novel vaccines and/or optimize current vaccination procedures. IBV belongs to the Coronaviridae family and contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome encoding four major structural proteins: a small envelope protein (E), integral membrane protein (M), phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), and spike glycoprotein (S) [19] . The S protein is cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 protein is very important for inducing protective immunity and has been successfully used to construct IBV DNA vaccines [6, 9] . The N protein is conserved and induces CTL as well as activated B cell responses, which are critical for preventing IBV infection in poultry [8, 20] . The M glycoprotein can induce the production of detectable antibodies and delayed type hypersensitivity responses [8] . Hence, all of these proteins are primary targets for developing DNA vaccines to elicit immune responses."
Cardiovascular & Hematological Agents in Medicinal Chemistry The journal for current and in-depth reviews on Cardiovascular & Hematological Agents Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.net Artificial Blood: A Futuristic Dimension of Modern Day Transfusion Sciences,"Artificial blood is an innovative concept of transfusion medicine where specifically designed compounds perform the task of transport and delivery of oxygen in the body to replace this function of allogenic human blood transfusion. Several molecules have been developed in the past few decades to achieve this objective and continous refinements are being continuously made in the quest of the ideal blood substitute. Currently, available technology manufactures artificial blood from haemoglobin obtained from outdated human/bovine blood (Haemoglobin Based Oxygen Carriers) or utilizing Perfluorocarbons. These synthetic blood substitutes are advantageous in that they do not require compatibility testing, are free from blood borne infections, have prolonged shelf life and do not require refrigeration. Artificial blood is projected to have a significant impact on the development of medical care in the future. It can complement the current blood products for transfusion and create a stable supply of safe and effective products. It is likely to reduce the requirements of blood transfusions drastically especially in settings of trauma and surgery thereby reducing the reliance on banked donated blood.","With the phenomenal increase in the number of surgical procedures (both elective and emergency) and trauma cases, the demand for human blood for transfusion has seen an overwhelming rise. The number of units collected from blood donors is insufficient to cope up with the increasing requirements of human blood which modern day medicine and surgery demands. Additionally, donated human blood is fraught with concerns related to short storage life, possibility of transmission of blood borne infections, allergic reactions and increasing costs of collecting, processing and crossmatching. To mitigate this ever expanding disparity between the demand and supply of blood and the difficulties associated with stored human blood, artificial blood has emerged as a promising option. Artificial blood serves to provide a substitute of conventional blood transfusion where blood or blood products derived from one person is infused into another. The term artificial blood is often used interchangeably with blood surrogate or blood substitutes and all of them are actually misnomers as artificial blood lacks numerous essential attributes of human blood like haemostatic processes, typing and immunologic defense of the body, nonetheless it serves to carry out the important function of transporting *Address correspondence to this author at the Department of Anaesthesia, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India; Tel: 9256543256; E-mail: rudrashish@yahoo.com oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body.

Case Report,"We report a case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in a 61-year-old businessman returning from Kuwait. The patient arrived there on August 16, 2018, developed watery diarrhea on August 28 (day 0), and came back to Korea on September 7 (day 10) as his condition worsened. Upon arrival, he complained of diarrhea and weakness, but denied any respiratory symptoms, and he directly went to visit an emergency room. Chest radiography revealed interstitial infiltrates in the lungs, and he was immediately transferred to an isolation unit. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of sputum samples taken on day 11 returned positive for MERS-CoV. No secondary MERS-CoV infection was identified among people who had close contact with him. This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion of MERS-CoV infection in any febrile patients who present after a trip to the Middle East.","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory illness caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia 1 and in Jordan. 2 Since then, 27 countries have reported 2,254 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS, and as of October 12, 2018 , 800 MERS-CoV-related deaths (case-fatality rate, 35%) have been reported to the World Health Organization. 3 The Korean outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in May, June, and July of 2015. There were 186 cases including 38 deaths, which is the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula. 4 Subsequently, there were no additional MERS cases in Korea until August 2018. Here, we report the first imported case of MERS-CoV infection in Korea since the end of the large outbreak in 2015."
Case Report A Rare Case of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 in a Child With Persistent Fatigue,"Adrenal insufficiency is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition whose diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Adrenal insufficiency may be primary, secondary, or tertiary with varied etiologies. Primary insufficiency may be part of a cluster of autoimmune diseases, referred to as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome(s) (APS). We describe a case of a 15-year-old male who presents to a local emergency department complaining of fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for a few days with a preceding viral illness. The patient was hyponatremic and hyperkalemic with skin hyperpigmentation, raising concern for adrenal insufficiency. Laboratory workup confirmed autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency, with subsequent laboratory studies revealing autoimmune thyroiditis and celiac disease. Concomitant Addison's and Hashimoto's diseases led to a diagnosis of APS type 2. The patient was started on steroid replacement with rapid clinical improvement.","Adrenal insufficiency is decreased or deficient production of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids that has potential to be life-threatening. 1,2 First described by Thomas Addison in 1855, this disease can present insidiously with weakness, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, salt cravings, depression, anxiety, as well as mucosal and epithelial hyperpigmentation. 1, 2 Adrenal insufficiency is related to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 1, 2 Primary disease refers to pathology of the adrenal cortex; secondary refers to inadequate or deficient release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or inappropriate response to this hormone by the adrenal gland; and tertiary refers to disordered hypothalamic production of corticotropin releasing hormone. 1 Primary adrenal disease occurs more commonly in women, frequently presenting between 30 and 50 years of life. Tuberculosis was formerly the most common cause; however, autoimmune adrenal insufficiency is now responsible for close to 90% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency. [1] [2] [3] Infectious diseases, neoplasia, adrenalectomy, and genetic causes account for other etiologies. 2 Among pediatric patients, most cases are related to genetic causes, while only a small fraction are related to autoimmune disease. 1,2 Secondary insufficiency is more common than primary in all age groups and often develops around 60 years of age. 1 Tertiary insufficiency is most often caused by suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis by long-term steroid use. 1 Approximately 80% to 90% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency have autoimmune etiology, with approximately 60% of those being related to an APS. 1, 4 APSs refer to various clusters or combinations of autoimmune disorders that are rare and consist of 2 or more concomitant autoimmune-mediated diseases. 5 To make a diagnosis of an APS, an autoimmune basis for each component of the syndrome must be confirmed. 3 845074G PHXXX10.1177/2333794X19845074Global Pediatric HealthSmith and Gerrits case-report2019 1 Beaumont Hospital, Troy, MI, USA 2 Beaumont Children's Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA APS type 1, or autoimmune polyglandular, candidiasis, ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), is an autosomal recessive disorder related to mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. Often seen in groups of people indigenous to Finland and Sardinia, APS type 1 is notable by adrenocortical insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, candidiasis, dental enamel hypoplasia, and nail dystrophy. 1, 6 Diabetes, pernicious anemia, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism are examples of other autoimmune disorders that may be associated with APS type 1. 1,7 APS type 1 generally manifests in infancy, between ages 3 and 5 years, or in early adolescence; as such, APS type 1 is also known as juvenile autoimmune poly-endocrinopathy. 5 APS type 1 is considered very rare, with an incidence of less than 1:100 000/year. 5 APS type 2, also known as Schmidt's or Carpenter's syndrome, is a cluster of autoimmune diseases characterized by autoimmune adrenal insufficiency and thyroid disease with or without type 1 diabetes. 1, [5] [6] [7] Autoimmune diseases that may be associated include hypogonadism, hypopituitarism, immunoglobulin A deficiency, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, and vitiligo. 1,5-7 APS type 2 is more prevalent than APS type 1, often associated with multiple autoimmune conditions, and is more common in women than men. 1,3 There is a peak incidence between 20 and 60 years of life, with the third or fourth decades being the most common. 3, 5, 6 In contrast to APS type 1, which has an association with a defect in the AIRE gene, APS type 2 is associated with genetic abnormalities of class II HLA alleles. 3,6,7 APS type 2 has a male-to-female ratio of 1:3 and is relatively common with an incidence of 1-2:10 000/year. 5 Given predilection to concomitant diseases, regular surveillance is crucial to screen for other conditions. 7 Clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency include hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. 1 Symptoms are nonspecific, including fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, myalgias, and salt craving. 1 As such, diagnosis begins with a high index of suspicion. Laboratory studies consistent with primary insufficiency includes elevated early morning ACTH, elevated plasma renin activity, low aldosterone, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. 1 Whereas ACTH is elevated in primary insufficiency, ACTH is low or normal in secondary and tertiary insufficiency. 1 An early morning cortisol level with a level <3 µg/dL is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. 3 The ""gold standard"" cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH) stimulation test is often used for diagnosis, wherein synthetic ACTH is administered intravenously, with cortisol level checked 30 and 60 minutes after administration. [1] [2] [3] Cortisol levels <14 µg/ dL are positive. 1,3 Diagnosis of specific APS syndromes is achieved by screening for each individual disease process suspected. 5 "
Sequential Coupling between CoplI and CopI Vesicle Coats in Endoplasmic Reticulum to Golgi Transport,"COPI and COPII are vesicle coat complexes whose assembly is regulated by the ARF1 and Sarl GTPases, respectively. We show that COPI and COPII coat complexes are recruited separately and independently to ER (COPII), pre-Golgi (COPI, COPII), and Golgi (COPI) membranes of mammalian cells. To address their individual roles in ER to Golgi transport, we used stage specific in vitro transport assays to synchronize movement of cargo to and from pre-Golgi intermediates, and GDP-and GTP-restricted forms of Sarl and ARF1 proteins to control coat recruitment. We find that COPII is solely responsible for export from the ER, is lost rapidly following vesicle budding and","mediates a vesicular step required for the build-up of pre-Golgi intermediates composed of clusters of vesicles and small tubular elements. COPI is recruited onto pre-Golgi intermediates where it initiates segregation of the anterograde transported protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) from the retrograde transported protein p58, a protein which actively recycles between the ER and pre-Golgi intermediates. We propose that sequential coupling between COPII and COPI coats is essential to coordinate and direct bi-directional vesicular traffic between the ER and pre-Golgi intermediates involved in transport of protein to the Golgi complex. N 'EWLY synthesized proteins are transported from the ER through the early secretory pathway via coated vesicular carriers. Two distinct protein complexes are now recognized to mediate vesicle budding from the ER and Golgi compartments. These include COPI or ""coatomer"" and COPII (for reviews see Nuoffer and Balch, 1994; Barlowe, 1995) . Studies in vitro (Kuge et al., 1994; Peter et al., 1993 Peter et al., , 1994 and in vivo (Guo et aL, 1994; Hobbie et al., 1994; Pepperkok et al., 1993) in mammalian cells, and biochemical and genetic analyses in yeast (for review see Pryer et al., 1992) , have shown that both coats are essential for the anterograde transport of protein from the ER to the Golgi stack. However, their individual specific roles in mediating the movement of cargo through early steps of the secretory pathway remains to be determined."
Using an epidemiological framework and bovine spongiform encephalopathy investigation questionnaire to investigate suspect bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases: an example from a bovine spongiform encephalopathy case in Ireland in 2015,"In several EU member states, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases have been identified in cattle born after the reinforced ban (BARB cases), for reasons that are not entirely clear. Epidemiological investigation of these cases has proved challenging. The European Food Safety Authority recently recommended the collection of a predefined set of epidemiological data from BSE suspects and confirmed BSE cases to aid future investigations. In this study, we present an epidemiological framework and BSE investigation questionnaire to aid the investigation of suspect BSE cases, and illustrate its application during the investigation of a BSE case in Ireland in 2015. It is recommended that the framework and questionnaire are used concurrently: the framework provides structure and focus, whereas the questionnaire (with 135 questions) aids data collection. The framework focuses on confirmation and discrimination, estimating the date and location of exposure, and determining the method/ source of exposure. The BSE case in Ireland in 2015 was a BARB case born in 2010. It was identified with classical BSE at an authorised knackery as part of Ireland's targeted active surveillance programme for BSE. No definitive source of infection with the BSE agent could be attributed in this case.","Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease of cattle, first recognised in 1986 in the UK. 1 An early study indicated that BSE was consistent with exposure of cattle to a scrapie-like agent via cattle feedstuffs containing ruminant-derived protein. 2 Transmission mainly occurs during calfhood, with the time of infection ranging between 0 and 18 months of age and a typical incubation period of five years. 3 4 In dairy cattle, the age-dependent risk of infection is highest during the first six months of life. 5 Since 1987, 28 countries in Europe, Asia and North America have reported cases of BSE. The International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) assigns a BSE disease status to member countries, and in 2016 categorised 46 countries as having a negligible BSE risk and 8 as having a controlled BSE risk. 6 In Ireland, the first case of BSE was diagnosed in 1989. 7 By December 31, 2016 , 1660 cases of BSE had been confirmed in Ireland, including four atypical BSE cases, as discussed later. Most clinical BSE cases have been detected in cattle aged between four and eight years, with an age range from three to twelve years. 8 9 Since 1989, it has been a legal requirement for any person observing an animal with clinical signs consistent with BSE to inform the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM). In line with EU legislation, all cohorts and progeny of BSE-positive animals are traced, killed and disposed of outside the food chain."
Brief Communication,"Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.","A 54-year-old Korean man living in Wuhan, China entered Korea on January 20, 2020 and felt the first symptoms of chills and muscle pain on January 22. After contacting a public health center on January 25, he was isolated in a negative pressure room at Myongji Hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26."
Discrimination of Kawasaki disease with con comi tant adenoviral detection differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection,"Purpose: Human adenovirus infection mimics Kawasaki disease (KD) but can be detected in KD patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical differences between KD with adenovirus infection and only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers for prediction of adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection. Methods: A total of 147 patients with isolated adenovirus were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 11 patients having KD with adenovirus, who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy during the acute phase of KD were also evaluated. Results: Compared with the adenoviral infection group, the KD with adenovirus group was significantly associated with frequent lip and tongue changes, skin rash and changes in the extremities. In the laboratory parameters, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level and presence of hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria were significantly associated with the KD group. In the multivariate analysis, lip and tongue changes (odds ratio [OR], 1.416; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.151-1.741; P=0.001), high CRP level (OR, 1.039; 95% CI 1.743-1.454; P= 0.021) and sterile pyuria (OR 1.052; 95% CI 0.861-1.286; P=0.041) were the significant predictive factors of KD. In addition, the cutoff CRP level related to KD with adenoviral detection was 56 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9%. Conclusion: Lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly correlated with adenovirus-positive KD.","Various studies have been carried out to find out the etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD). Viral infection is thought to be one of the causes of KD, but it is still controversial [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although several potential viral causes of KD are identified, the diagnosis of KD with concomitant viral infection is a little unclear to confirm KD. Adenoviral infection is frequently involved in young children less than 3 years and is characterized with prolonged high fever, upper and lower respiratory tract symptom, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptom with hepatic involvement. Inflammatory biomarker such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are mostly ele vated in patients with adenoviral infection. Because of strong inflammatory response, adeno viral infection closely resembles bacterial infection and KD [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although the majority patients of adenoviral infection presented respiratory condition, extrapulmonary manifestation of conjunctivitis, skin rash, mucous membrane changes, cervical lymphadenopathy and encephalitis can be associated. The various clinical manifestation of adenovirus infections are particularly similar to KD regarding the clinical aspects [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ."
Bats host major mammalian paramyxoviruses,"The large virus family Paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant human and livestock viruses, such as measles-, distemper-, mumps-, parainfluenza-, newcastle disease-, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses. Here we identify an estimated 66 new paramyxoviruses in a worldwide sample of 119 bat and rodent species (9,278 individuals). major discoveries include evidence of an origin of Hendra-and nipah virus in Africa, identification of a bat virus conspecific with the human mumps virus, detection of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus, mouse pneumonia-and canine distemper virus in bats, as well as direct evidence of sendai virus in rodents. Phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae). Future attempts to predict the emergence of novel paramyxoviruses in humans and livestock will have to rely fundamentally on these data.","T he ability to predict and prevent viral epidemics has become a major objective in the public health disciplines. Knowledge of viral hosts enables the identification of maintenance populations from which epidemics may emerge [1] [2] [3] [4] . From an ecological perspective, the natural host of a given virus may be regarded as its habitat 5, 6 . Unfortunately, unbiased assessment of habitat is impossible, as it requires the investigation of all host species in all possible geographical locations. Moreover, the delimitations of viral species and populations are often not well defined. However, viral phylogenies can identify whether extant viruses encountered in a given host are less or more directly linked to common ancestors, providing clues to virus origins [4] [5] [6] ."
Adeno-Associated Viruses Serotype 2-Mediated RNA Interference Efficiently Inhibits Rabies Virus Replication In Vitro and In Vivo,"To investigate the potential of adeno-associated viruses serotype 2 (AAV2)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as an antiviral agent against rabies, recombinant AAV2 vectors expressing siRNA targeting the nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus (RAbV) (rAAV-N796) were constructed and evaluated. When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N796 were challenged with RAbV, there was a 37.8 ± 3.4% to 55.1 ± 5.3% reduction in RAbV virus titer. When cells pre-challenged with RAbV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 ± 1.4 to 28.8 ± 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RAbV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer. When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations. Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 ± 5.3 and 62.5 ± 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RAbV. When mice treated intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 were challenged intramuscularly with lethal RAbV, they exhibited 37.5 ± 3.7% protection. When mice were intracerebrally and intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 24 hr after exposure to RAbV infection, they exhibited 25 ± 4.1% protection The N gene mRNA levels in the brains of challenged mice with three different administrations were reduced (55, 68, 32 and 25%, respectively). These results indicated that AAV2 vector-mediated siRNA delivery in vitro in NA cells inhibited RAbV multiplication, inhibited RAbV multiplication in vivo in the mice brain and imparted partial protection against lethal rabies. So, it may have a potential to be used as an alternative antiviral approach against rabies.","Rabies is a disease of the central nervous system that constantly produces victims in human beings as well as in animals. Rabies cases are reported worldwide, but are most prevalent in undeveloped countries, specifically in rural areas of Africa and Asia. No definitive and effective treatment has been established to cure the disease once the clinical stage has been reached, and only a small portion of clinical cases responds to intensive therapeutic management and survives [19] . Once the clinical symptoms of rabies appear, conventional post-exposure treatment is unsuccessful, because of its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier [9] . Thus, the current strategy to control rabies is pre-exposure prophylaxis by vaccine injection, but research efforts are focused on developing an effective, safe prophylactic and/or therapeutic tool against RAbV infection."
Detection of Ascitic Feline Coronavirus RNA from Cats with Clinically Suspected Feline Infectious Peritonitis,"Ascitic feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA was examined in 854 cats with suspected feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) by RT-PCR. The positivity was significantly higher in purebreds (62.2%) than in crossbreds (34.8%) (P<0.0001). Among purebreds, the positivities in the Norwegian forest cat (92.3%) and Scottish fold (77.6%) were significantly higher than the average of purebreds (P=0.0274 and 0.0251, respectively). The positivity was significantly higher in males (51.5%) than in females (35.7%) (P<0.0001), whereas no gender difference has generally been noted in FCoV antibody prevalence, indicating that FIP more frequently develops in males among FCoV-infected cats. Genotyping was performed for 377 gene-positive specimens. Type I (83.3%) was far more predominantly detected than type II (10.6%) (P<0.0001), similar to previous serological and genetic surveys.","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated progressive infectious disease of domestic cats and wild felids caused by infection with feline coronavirus (FCoV), a single-stranded RNA virus classified as Alphacoronavirus [1, 28] . It is divided into effusive FIP, in which exudate is observed in the body cavity, and non-effusive FIP, in which multiple pyogranuloma lesions are formed, but differences in lesions are influenced by the immunity of individuals [3] . This disease is considered to be induced by a mutant of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), FIP virus (FIPV) [8, 26] . The incidence is generally about 1% in FCoV-infected cats, but it varies depending on the age, breed, environment and superinfection with other viruses [7, 8, 17, 23] . There are 2 genotypes of FCoV, and FCoV type II is considered to arise by recombination between FCoV type I and canine coronavirus (CCoV) [9, 27] . Based on serological and genetic investigations, FCoV type I is overwhelmingly dominant over FCoV type II, and mixed infection with both types is not rare [6, 11, 14, 15] . Since FIPV and FECV cannot be distinguished serologically or genetically, it is generally difficult to diagnose FIP [1] , but it has been stated that the demonstration of FCoV RNA in ascites is one of most reliable diagnostic indicators of FIP [3, 10] . Several results concerning the state of FIP incidence have been reported overseas [6, 15, 16, 18, 29] . In Japan, there have been several reports on the prevalence of FCoV infection [11, 13, 20, 24] , but, to our knowledge, no studies on FIP prevalence have been reported. Thus, in this study, to investigate the state of FIP incidence in Japan, we examined FCoV RNA in ascites of domestic cats suspected of having FIP using RT-PCR and investigated the genotype of detected FCoV RNA."
Clinical and Epidemiologic Characteristics of Spreaders of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus during the 2015 Outbreak in Korea,"Nosocomial transmission is an important characteristic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Risk factors for transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings are not well defined. During the Korean outbreak in 2015, 186 patients had laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Those suspected as a source of viral transmission were categorized into the spreader groups (super-spreader [n = 5] and usualspreader [n = 10]) and compared to the non-spreader group (n = 171). Body temperature of ≥ 38.5°C (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-22.30; P = 0.016), pulmonary infiltration of ≥ 3 lung zones (aOR, 7.33; 95% CI, 1.93-27.79; P = 0.003)","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel beta-coronavirus first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (1) . It causes severe acute respiratory infection, with a mortality rate of 36% (2) . Most MERS-CoV infections occur in the Middle East, although travel-associated MERS cases have been reported in 17 countries outside the Middle East. As of November 3, 2016, 27 countries reported 1,813 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 645 deaths, to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2) ."
"Molecular Characterization of Two Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: p38 MAP Kinase and Ribosomal S6 Kinase From Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), and Insight Into Their Roles in Response to BmNPV Infection","Proteins p38 map kinase and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) as members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles against pathogens. In this study, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified as differentially expressed proteins from iTRAQ database. Bmp38 and BmS6K were expressed, and recombinant proteins were purified. The bioinformatics analysis showed that both proteins have serine/threonine-protein kinases, catalytic domain (S_ TKc) with 360 and 753 amino acids, respectively. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K had high expression in the midgut and hemolymph. The comparative expression level of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 was upregulated than in P50 in the midgut after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. Western bolt results showed a positive correlation between RT-qPCR and iTRAQ data for Bmp38, but BmS6K data showed partial correlation with iTRAQ. Injection of anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K serum suggested that Bmp38 may be involved against BmNPV infection, whereas BmS6K may require phosphorylation modification to inhibit BmNPV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6k might play an important role in innate immunity of silkworm against BmNPV.","Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are class of evolutionarily conserved protein with Ser/Thr kinase domain. MAPKs have been widely identified from vertebrates to invertebrates, which involve in different signaling transduction pathways (Roux and Blenis 2004) . MAPK family can be classified into three major groups: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), C-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs (Marie Cargnello 2011). In addition, MAPKs are triggered by phosphorylation of conserved TxY motifs present in their Ser/Thr kinase domains. Among them, p38 and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) are members of MAPKs play a wide range of functions in various biological processes including apoptosis, pathogen infection, cell differentiation, inflammatory response, UV stress, and environmental stress (Yee et al. 2004 , Regan et al. 2009 , Fenton and Gout 2011 . Both p38 and S6K MAPK homolog have been studied in vertebrates and invertebrates (Han et al. 1998, Fenton and Gout 2011) ."
Synergistic effects of ATP and RNA binding to human DEAD-box protein DDX1,"RNA helicases of the DEAD-box protein family form the largest group of helicases. The human DEAD-box protein 1 (DDX1) plays an important role in tRNA and mRNA processing, is involved in tumor progression and is also hijacked by several virus families such as HIV-1 for replication and nuclear export. Although important in many cellular processes, the mechanism of DDX1 s enzymatic function is unknown. We have performed equilibrium titrations and transient kinetics to determine affinities for nucleotides and RNA. We find an exceptional tight binding of DDX1 to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), one of the strongest affinities observed for DEAD-box helicases. ADP binds tighter by three orders of magnitude when compared to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), arresting the enzyme in a potential dead-end ADP conformation under physiological conditions. We thus suggest that a nucleotide exchange factor leads to DDX1 recycling. Furthermore, we find a strong cooperativity in binding of RNA and ATP to DDX1 that is also reflected in ATP hydrolysis. We present a model in which either ATP or RNA binding alone can partially shift the equilibrium from an 'open' to a 'closed'-state; this shift appears to be not further pronounced substantially even in the presence of both RNA and ATP as the low rate of ATP hydrolysis does not change.","RNA helicases are involved in all major steps of RNA metabolism from transcription, pre-RNA processing to RNA transport and decay. They are classified into several super-and subfamilies according to conserved sequence motifs, domain composition and oligomeric state (1) (2) (3) . The largest group of helicases is formed by the DEAD-box protein family, which belongs to superfamily 2 (1). DEAD-box proteins are characterized by the signature sequence D-E-A-D (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) in their conserved Walker B mo-tif and have a central role in several metabolic processes, where they are often found in large hetero-oligomeric complexes (4) . The human DEAD-box protein DDX1 is unique amongst other family members since it contains a long ∼220 amino-acid insertion between the consensus motifs I ( = Walker A motif) and Ia (5) (Figure 1 ). It was originally identified by its overexpression in neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma cell lines where it is localized either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm depending on the cell type (6, 7) . Due to its overexpression in tumor tissue, DDX1 was recently proposed as a potential biomarker for breast cancer (8) and a predictive marker for ovarian and kidney carcinomas (9) . A large variety of cellular functions have been attributed to DDX1, such as mRNA/miRNA processing (9, 10) , interaction with hnRNP K (11) , involvement in NF-B -mediated transcription (12) , involvement in AU-rich element mediated decay (13) and recruitment to sites of DNA damage containing RNA-DNA structures (14) . Pulldown experiments have identified DDX1 to be part of the pentameric HSPC117 protein complex that is involved in tRNA processing (15) and RNA transport (16, 17) . One function of DDX1 in this complex is the stimulation of guanylation of the HSPC117 active site by the protein archease (18) , but details on the mechanism are lacking. Furthermore, DDX1 is hijacked as cellular co-factor for viral replication by coronavirus (19, 20) , hepatitis C virus (21) and JC virus (22) . It is critical for mRNA trafficking in HI virus type 1 (23) , where it is involved in the export of unspliced mRNAs in the Rev-CRM1 pathway (24, 25) . DDX1 promotes oligomerization of HIV-1 Rev protein on Revresponse-element (RRE) mRNA, which is essential for the export (26) . Additionally, it was demonstrated that recombinant DDX1 binds Rev and RRE RNA and has an RRE RNA-dependent catalytic activity (27) . RNA silencing experiments provide evidence that DDX1 is required for both Rev activity and production of HIV-1 virus particles (27) ."
Practical pathology of aging mice,"Old mice will have a subset of lesions as part of the progressive decline in organ function that defines aging. External and palpable lesions will be noted by the research, husbandry, or veterinary staff during testing, cage changing, or physical exams. While these readily observable lesions may cause alarm, not all cause undue distress or are life-threatening. In aging research, mice are maintained until near end of life that, depending on strain and genetic manipulation, can be upwards of 33 months. Aging research has unique welfare issues related to age-related decline, debilitation, fragility, and associated pain of chronic diseases. An effective aging research program includes the collaboration and education of the research, husbandry, and veterinary staff, and of the members of the institution animal care and use committee. This collaborative effort is critical to humanely maintaining older mice and preventing excessive censorship due to non-lethal diseases. Part of the educational process is becoming familiar with how old mice appear clinically, at necropsy and histopathologically. This baseline knowledge is important in making the determination of humane end points, defining health span, contributing causes of death and effects of interventions. The goal of this paper is to introduce investigators to age-associated diseases and lesion patterns in mice from clinical presentation to pathologic assessment. To do so, we present and illustrate the common clinical appearances, necropsy and histopathological lesions seen in subsets of the aging colonies maintained at the University of Washington.","A ging is characterized by progressive declines in multiple organ systems with increases in many neoplastic and chronic degenerative nonneoplastic diseases. Mice are a popular mammalian species for aging studies as they are relatively economical to maintain for long-term aging studies and are similar to humans genetically and physiologically (1, 2) . Genetically modified mice (GEMs) have been used extensively to test various hypothesis of aging (3, 4) ."
,"Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism that discards not only invading pathogens but also damaged organelles and denatured proteins via lysosomal degradation. Increasing evidence suggests a role for autophagy in inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. These studies suggest that modulating autophagy could be a novel therapeutic option for inflammatory diseases. Eosinophils are a major type of inflammatory cell that aggravates airway inflammatory diseases, particularly corticosteroid-resistant inflammation. The eosinophil count is a useful tool for assessing which patients may benefit from inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Recent studies demonstrate that autophagy plays a role in eosinophilic airway inflammatory diseases by promoting airway remodeling and loss of function. Genetic variant in the autophagy gene ATG5 is associated with asthma pathogenesis, and autophagy regulates apoptotic pathways in epithelial cells in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, autophagy dysfunction leads to severe inflammation, especially eosinophilic inflammation, in chronic rhinosinusitis. However, the mechanism underlying autophagy-mediated regulation of eosinophilic airway inflammation remains unclear. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the role of autophagy in eosinophilic airway inflammation. We also suggest that autophagy may be a new therapeutic target for airway inflammation, including that mediated by eosinophils.","Autophagy is an essential process that maintains cellular homeostasis and cell function by delivering cytosolic constituents, including organelles, denatured proteins, or invading pathogens, to lysosomes for degradation and amino acid recycling (1) (2) (3) . Through autophagy, cells eliminate damaged or harmful components, thereby ensuring survival after exposure to stressors such as hypoxia, ROS, DNA damage, aggregated proteins, damaged organelles, or intracellular pathogens (4) . Aberrant regulation of autophagy can result in cancer (5) , neurodegenerative disease (6) , and myopathies (7) . Generally, autophagy is categorized into 3 different types: macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy (8) . Usually, macroautophagy is regarded as ""autophagy""; we also referred it as autophagy in this review."
"Structure, Biosynthesis, and Localization of Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidase B, an Integral Membrane Glycoprotein of the Yeast Vacuole","We have characterized the structure, biogenesis, and localization of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP B), a membrane protein of the yeast vacuole. An antibody specific for DPAP B recognizes a 120-kD glycoprotein in yeast that behaves like an integral membrane protein in that it is not removed from membranes by high pH Na2COs treatment. Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence of DPAP B reveals a hydrophobic domain near the NH2 terminus that could potentially span a lipid bilayer. The in vitro enzymatic activity and apparent molecular weight of DPAP B are unaffected by the allelic state of PEP4, a gene essential for the proteolytic activation of a number of soluble vacuolar hydrolases. DPAP B is synthesized as a glycosylated precursor that is converted to the mature 120-kD species by carbohydrate addition. The precur-J. H. Rothman's present address is","sor form of DPAP B accumulates in sec mutants (Novick, P., C. Field, and R. Schekman. 1980. Cell. 21:205-215) that are blocked at the ER (sec18) or Golgi apparatus (sec7), but not at secretory vesicles (secl). Immunolocalization of DPAP B in wild-type or secl mutant cells shows that the protein resides in the vacuolar membrane. However, it is present in nonvacuolar compartments in sec18 and sec7 cells, confirming that the delivery of DPAP B is blocked in these mutants. Interestingly, DPAP B appears to stain the nuclear envelope in a sec18 mutant, which is consistent with the accumulation of DPAP B in the ER membrane at the restrictive temperature. These results suggest that soluble and membrane-bound vacuolar proteins use the same stages of the secretory pathway for their transport."
RNA methyltransferases involved in 5 0 cap biosynthesis,These authors contributed equally to the work.,"Nascent transcripts produced by RNA polymerases universally carry a 5 0 triphosphate (5 0 ppp). Processed RNA molecules, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, generated from precursors whose 5 0 segments were removed by nucleolytic cleavage, carry a 5 0 monophosphate (5 0 p). In several types of cellular and viral RNAs, the 5 0 end is further modified enzymatically, by a variety of modification enzymes, to introduce various chemical structures that are collectively dubbed as the ""5 0 caps"". This cap is absent in bacterial and archaeal transcripts."
5 0 -Triphosphate-RNA-independent activation of RIG-I via RNA aptamer with enhanced antiviral activity,"RIG-I is a cytosolic receptor for non-self RNA that mediates immune responses against viral infections through IFNa/b production. In an attempt to identify novel tools that modulate IFNa/b production, we used SELEX technology to screen RNA aptamers that specifically target RIG-I protein.","Infection by both known and newly emerging RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, influenza virus and SARS-CoV, are a severe threat to public health. RNA viruses cause injury to the infected organs and disrupt normal functioning, leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality (1) (2) (3) . RNA viruses exhibit genomic hyper-variation, mainly caused by low fidelity of the virus-derived RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (4, 5) . Instability of the RNA viral genome allows viruses to escape from virus-specific drugs and vaccines. Because the development of stable vaccines for RNA viruses is a challenging task, alternative tools that modulate the immune response against a viral infection are of great interest (6) (7) (8) . Among them, IFN-based therapy shows a strong potential for HCV clearance by stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune system of the infected host, although IFN resistance is often reported in HCV-infected patients. The concept of IFNbased therapy for virus eradication prompted the exploration of therapeutic agents that target innate immune systems of the infected host (9) . In this regard, synthetic agonists for Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been successfully developed as potent IFN-inducers, and their potential to control viral replication and infection-related diseases has been extensively studied (6, 8, 10) ."
"Citation: Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e133","Development of RNAi-based therapeutics has the potential to revolutionize treatment options for a range of human diseases. However, as with gene therapy, a major barrier to progress is the lack of methods to achieve and measure efficient delivery for systemic administration. We have developed a positive-readout pharmacodynamic transgenic reporter mouse model allowing noninvasive real-time assessment of siRNA activity. The model combines a luciferase reporter gene under the control of regulatory elements from the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Introduction of siRNA targeting lac repressor results in increased luciferase expression in cells where siRNA is biologically active. Five founder luciferase-expressing and three founder Lacexpressing lines were generated and characterized. Mating of ubiquitously expressing luciferase and lac lines generated progeny in which luciferase expression was significantly reduced compared with the parental line. Administration of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside either in drinking water or given intraperitoneally increased luciferase expression in eight of the mice examined, which fell rapidly when withdrawn. Intraperitoneal administration of siRNA targeting lac in combination with Lipofectamine 2000 resulted in increased luciferase expression in the liver while control nontargeting siRNA had no effect. We believe a sensitive positive readout pharmacodynamics reporter model will be of use to the research community in RNAi-based vector development.","RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful approach for suppressing expression of specific genes in mammalian cells, either as a basic research tool to elucidate gene function, or in a clinical setting for therapeutic application. 1-3 Therapeutic strategies eliciting RNAi involve targeting exogenous genes from pathogens or endogenous genes playing a role in the disease process. Since the landmark discovery of RNAi in 1998, the number of in vivo studies involving siRNA has greatly increased with thousands of studies now reported and >30 clinical trials involving siRNA-or shRNA-based drugs having been opened. 4, 5 Although local delivery of siRNA may be very effective in some settings [6] [7] [8] [9] , for many diseases, delivery to disseminated or body-wide targets is required. There have been several steps towards enabling systemic delivery of siRNA, including both improved chemistry to increase serum stability and reduced immunostimulation, 4,10 coupled with delivery strategies such as hydrodynamic injection, 11, 12 liposomes and lipid-based nanoparticles, [13] [14] [15] polyplexes, 16, 17 ligand-siRNA conjugates, [18] [19] [20] and inorganic particles. 21, 22 However, there remain major challenges in studying the performance of siRNA given intravenously. Biodistribution has been studied by fluorescence, 23, 24 radioactivity, 25, 26 or complexation with magnetic nanoparticles, 27 although tracing techniques may intrinsically alter pharmacokinetics of the labeled molecules and the time window of usefulness for such studies is limited by siRNA catabolism."
Efficient Replication of the Novel Human Betacoronavirus EMC on Primary Human Epithelium Highlights Its Zoonotic Potential,"The recent emergence of a novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) in the Middle East raised considerable concerns, as it is associated with severe acute pneumonia, renal failure, and fatal outcome and thus resembles the clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed in 2002 and 2003. Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC is of zoonotic origin and closely related to bat coronaviruses. The human airway epithelium (HAE) represents the entry point and primary target tissue for respiratory viruses and is highly relevant for assessing the zoonotic potential of emerging respiratory viruses, such as HCoV-EMC. Here, we show that pseudostratified HAE cultures derived from different donors are highly permissive to HCoV-EMC infection, and by using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and RNAseq data, we experimentally determined the identity of seven","Replication of HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV on HAE cultures. (A) HAE cultures from three donors (0712, black; 1001, light gray; 1505, dark gray) were prepared as described previously (7) and infected with HCoV-EMC or SARS-CoV (MOI ϭ 0.1). Progeny virus release at the apical (top and bottom) and basolateral (middle) surfaces of HCoV-EMC-or SARS-CoV-infected HAE cultures was determined as genome equivalents (GE) or plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml at the indicated hpi by using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) specific for HCoV-EMC (16) and SARS-CoV (17) or titration of infectious particles on Vero cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each donor. Data are depicted as mean values Ϯ standard deviations (SD); nd, not detected. (B) HCoV-EMC-and SARS-CoV-infected (MOI ϭ 0.1) or mock-treated HAE cell cultures were fixed 48 hpi with 6% PFA and immunostained using the procedure as described (18) . Rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against SARS-CoV Nsp3 (green; anti-SARS-CoV antibody; Rockland) and mouse monoclonal antibody directed against dsRNA (red; J2; English & Scientific Consulting Bt.) were used as primary antibodies. Dylight 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (HϩL) and Dylight 647-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (HϩL) (Jackson Immunoresearch) were applied as secondary antibodies, followed by two separate incubation steps with Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-␤-tubulin antibody (light blue; Sigma) for staining of ciliated cells and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen) for staining nuclei (dark blue). Images were acquired using an EC, Plan-Neofluor 63ϫ/1.40 oil differential inference contrast (DIC) M27 objective on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Image capture, analysis, and processing were performed using the ZEN 2010 (Zeiss) and Imaris (Bitplane Scientific Software) software packages.

Single reads are depicted in green (sense) and red (antisense). The (Continued) point and primary target tissue of respiratory viruses. To assess the zoonotic potential of HCoV-EMC, it is therefore critically important to determine if the human respiratory epithelium is susceptible to HCoV-EMC infection. To address this question, we used human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures that morphologically and functionally resemble the upper conducting airways in vivo (6) . The HAE culture system is based on primary human bronchial epithelial cells obtained by biopsy, brushing, surgery, or lung transplant. Isolated bronchial epithelial cells are manipulated with chemically defined medium to initiate their differentiation into a pseudostratified human airway epithelial culture. When differentiation is complete, the pseudostratified HAE cell layer (i) contains basal, secretory, columnar, and ciliated cell populations and (ii) will generate mucus (6, 7) . Therefore, this in vitro system recapitulates many aspects of the human airway epithelium, namely, the presence of well-defined cell types of the human airway epithelium, and physical barriers, such as the mucous layer."
Alteration of somatostatin receptor 2 expression in canine mammary gland tumor,"Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is a negative regulator of cell proliferation in human breast cancer. Since there is little information about SSTR2 in canine mammary gland tumor (MGT), we clarified its distribution and expression level in normal mammary gland, benign MGT and malignant MGT. SSTR2 expression determined by immunohistochemical staining was observed in the cytoplasm of luminal epithelial cells. The intensity was negatively correlated with malignancy: normal tissues and some of the benign tumors had the highest levels, while the malignant tumors had little or no SSTR2 expression. As for the Western blotting, SSTR2 protein level in benign tumors was significantly lower than the normal mammary gland. On the other hand, SSTR2 protein levels in two of three malignant tumors were higher than the other groups. These results suggest that SSTR2 expression alters according to the malignancy of canine MGT.","Somatostatin (SST) is a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus, pancreas and intestine; it regulates both endocrine and exocrine gland function [17] , and downregulates cell proliferation in various tissues of many species including dogs [1, 3, 4, 10, 14] . Among the SST receptor (SSTR) superfamily, SSTR2 is the most dominant receptor, with the highest affinity to the ligand and the strongest antiproliferative effect [3] . In human breast cancer, tumor tissues that express SSTRs are less aggressive and more differentiated than tumors with little SSTRs expression, which are massive and highly malignant [5] . These findings lead to the speculation that SSTR signal transduction is closely related to the malignancy of human breast cancer."
Bulk production of the antiviral lectin griffithsin,"Application of plant-based protein expression systems for bulk production of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals is building momentum. There are considerable regulatory challenges to consider in commercialization of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), some of which are inherent to plant-production systems and others that are common with other production systems, but are new to PMPs because of the youth of the industry. In this review, we discuss our recent and ongoing experience with bulk production of the HIV microbicide candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), utilizing plant-based transient protein expression, with specific focus on areas relevant to commercial manufacturing of bulk GRFT active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Analytical programs have been developed for the qualification and monitoring of both the expression vector system and the API detailing our experience and plans for each. Monitoring postpurification protein modifications are discussed in relation to stability and safety programs. Expression, processing and analytics programs are associated with increased manufacturing costs in current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production because of the required qualification testing. The impact of these costs on the overall cost of goods is particularly relevant to GRFT manufacturing because GRFT, as an HIV microbicide, is most needed in populations at high risk for HIV exposure in resource-poor countries. Consequently, GRFT for microbicide applications is a very cost-sensitive recombinant PMP. We have therefore emphasized maintaining a low cost of goods. We provide a review of the literature on the economics of PMPs with various expression systems and how they may impact production costs and complexity.","Griffithsin (GRFT) is a 121 amino acid lectin identified in the red marine alga, Griffithsia sp. (Mori et al., 2005) . Structural characterization of GRFT showed it to be a domain swapped homodimer with six carbohydrate binding sites that bind to terminal mannose residues on N-linked glycans of the HIV envelope protein, gp120 (Moulaei et al., 2010; Xue et al., 2012 Xue et al., , 2013 Ziolkowska et al., 2006) . Subsequent functional characterization of GRFT has demonstrated it to be a potent HIV inhibitor with minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo (Barton et al., 2014; Emau et al., 2007; Kouokam et al., 2011; Mori et al., 2005; O'Keefe et al., 2009) . GRFT displays picomolar EC 50 values in its inhibition of laboratory and primary HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates and has shown stability and activity in macaque vaginal fluid (Emau et al., 2007; Ferir et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2005) . Further investigation of GRFT's safety profile revealed that although it can bind the human squamous epithelial layer and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cells and tissues did not exhibit significant inflammatory responses when exposed to GRFT and GRFT retained picomolar levels of antiviral activity (Kouokam et al., 2011) . Our studies on topical delivery of GRFT in a murine model of SARS-Coronavirus infection showed GRFT treatment to be both safe and efficacious , and studies on systemic delivery of GRFT also showed a good safety profile in rodent models with minimal changes in spleen and liver size and no coincident pathological changes (Barton et al., 2014) . GRFT's favourable safety profile and potent, broad spectrum antiviral activity has promoted its development as an HIV microbicide (Zeitlin et al., 2009) ."
In Vitro Viability and Cytotoxicity Testing and Same-Well Multi-Parametric Combinations for High Throughput Screening,"In vitro cytotoxicity testing has become an integral aspect of drug discovery because it is a convenient, costeffective, and predictive means of characterizing the toxic potential of new chemical entities. The early and routine implementation of this testing is testament to its prognostic importance for humans. Although a plethora of assay chemistries and methods exist for 96-well formats, few are practical and sufficiently sensitive enough for application in high throughput screening (HTS). Here we briefly describe a handful of the currently most robust and validated HTS assays for accurate and efficient assessment of cytotoxic risk. We also provide guidance for successful HTS implementation and discuss unique merits and detractions inherent in each method. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of combining specific HTS compatible assays into multi-parametric, same-well formats.",A significant advance in the field of early medicine was Paracelsus' recognition that all compounds have the capacity to be poisonous depending upon dosage [1] . This observation makes toxicity testing a necessary and critical industry practice to identify and define safety thresholds for all new potential chemotherapeutics. The advent of in vitro cytotoxicity testing has greatly streamlined this process and is now considered to be a nearly compulsory activity starting at target validation and continuing through medicinal modification.
Systemic resilience to cross-border infectious disease threat events in Europe,"Regulations (IHR) aim to prevent, detect and respond to such threats, through increase in national public health core capacities, but whether IHR core capacity implementation is necessary and sufficient has been contested. With a longitudinal study we relate changes in national IHR core capacities to changes in cross-border infectious disease threat events (IDTE) between 2010 and 2016, collected through epidemic intelligence at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

These IDTE have caused substantial human suffering, placed considerable pressure on government resources, and inflicted significant economic damage. In financial terms, the cost of potential pandemics can amount to US$60 billion per year (Sands, Mundaca-Shah, & Dzau, 2016; Sands, Turabi, Saynisch, & Dzau, 2016) . However, if mortality costs are also taken into account, the annual cost can be as high as US$490 billion (Fan, Summers, & Jamison, 2016) ."
An updated estimation of the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov)-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/),"The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population. It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th , 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.","Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA and viral particles resembling a crown e from which the name derives. They belong to the order of Nidovirales, family of Coronaviridae, and subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae (Carlos, Dela Cruz, Cao, Pasnick, & Jamil, 2020) . They can affect mammals, including humans, causing generally mild infectious disorders, sporadically leading to severe outbreaks clusters, such as those generated by the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"" (SARS) virus in 2003 in mainland China, and by the ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome"" (MERS) virus in 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in 2015 in South Korea (Gralinski & Menachery, 2020) ."
Comparison of Different Samples for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection by Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests,"A severe respiratory ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus was recently emerged in China. Here, we reported the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 19 suspect cases. We compared J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","As Table1 shown, the median age was 33 years, and 57.89%were women. According to the results of the oropharyngeal swab NAAT, nine patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV, and the other ten cases were negative for 2019-nCoV based on the nucleic acid test results. We found that all nine confirmed patients and five out of the ten negative cases showed bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and patchy ground-glass opacities in CT scans (Figure 1 ). To avoid false negative results, we recollected oropharyngeal swab specimens for these negative cases and reconducted "
Silent geographical spread of the H7N9 virus by online knowledge analysis of the live bird trade with a distributed focused crawler,"Unlike those infected by H5N1, birds infected by the newly discovered H7N9 virus have no observable clinical symptoms. Public health workers in China do not know where the public health threat lies. In this study, we used a distributed focused crawler to analyze online knowledge of the live bird trade in first-wave provinces, namely, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai, to track the new H7N9 virus and predict its spread. Of the 18 provinces proposed to be at high risk of infection, 10 reported human infections and one had poultry specimens that tested positive. Five provinces (Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Tibet) as well as Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were proposed to have no risk of H7N9 virus infection from the live bird trade. These data can help health authorities and the public to respond rapidly to reduce damage related to the spread of the virus.","Approximately one month after confirmation of the first three cases of human infection with the new reassortant avian influenza virus (H7N9), the disease had extended to 42 cities in 12 provinces, infecting 134 people and killing 45 people in China as of September 10, 2013. 1 The viral isolates from patients were similar to the isolate from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. 2 Approximately 77% of patients had a history of exposure to live poultry. 3 The virus was clearly of avian origin, and the patients were infected in farmers' markets with live birds (FMLB) through an unknown mechanism. Suspending the FMLB can prevent new human infections in cities with a high population density. 4 The sporadic human infection patterns were distributed in 39 cities and occurred at various times, indicating that the virus is silently spreading in live birds over a far larger geographical area and at a far greater speed than originally thought. 2, 5, 6 The movement of live birds is a well-known risk factor for the geographic dissemination of the virus among poultry flocks. The daily incidence of H5N1 virus outbreaks in Vietnam peaks around the annual holiday festivities in February coinciding with poultry movement increases. 7, 8 Therefore, determining the location of live birds carrying the virus and the FMLB that is contaminated by the live-bird trade is critical in stopping the surge of human infection and the geographical dissemination of the disease. The traditional investigation of animals carrying the virus is based on the virological diagnosis of animals with a possible epidemiological link. 9, 10 This task can be difficult because China has approximately six billion domestic birds. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, more cases of human infection by the virus are expected. 6, 11 Crowd-powered expansion and the distrib-uted focused crawler are methods that use large-scale online data to reveal human behavior accessible to research. 12 The method as used in this study to reveal live-bird-trading information to predict the potential nationwide geographic spreading of H7N9 virus, which could not be identified by traditional epidemiological investigation methods."
Translational Diffusion of Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Molecules Is Constrained by Their Cytoplasmic Domains,"Site-directed mutagenesis in vitro was used to introduce stop codons in the genomic DNA of the a and/3 chains of the murine class II major histocompatibility complex antigen, I-A k. Mutated DNA was transfected into B lymphoma cells that were then selected by neomycin resistance and for their ability to express I-A k molecules on their plasma membrane. The translational diffusion coefficient (Dtat) of I-A k molecules composed of a wild-type/3 chain paired with an ot chain missing either 6 or 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain is on the average threefold higher than the D,,, of wild-type I-A k molecules as measured by fluorescence photobleaching and recovery. The removal of 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain of the/3 chain did not change the D~a~ value from that of wild-type I-A k if the truncated/3 chain was paired with a wild-type c~ chain. Removing all amino acids of the cytoplasmic domains of both the ot and/3 chains resulted in a 10-fold increase in the Dtat, the highest value for any of the truncated I-A k molecules tested. These data indicate that the carboxy-terminal six amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the et chain and the six plasma membrane-proximal amino acids of the/3 chain are important in constraining the translational diffusion of I-A k molecules in the plasma membrane.","T HE cytoplasmic domains of a number of transmembrane membrane proteins are thought to be important in the membrane biology of those proteins (3, 13, (16) (17) (18) 31) . Plasma membrane proteins with truncated cytoplasmic domains may not be correctly sorted or internalized and may lose signaling functions (22) (23) (24) 26) . Surprisingly, the translational diffusion coefficient (D,.t)' of proteins with such truncations is not found to differ from that of full-length molecules. Dj., of the EGF receptor (16) , class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen (10) , or G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (25) is not changed when the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules are truncated by directed mutation of their genes. At the extreme, this involves a reduction from 542 to 9 residues in the EGF receptor (16) . These studies imply that the amino acids removed are not associated with cytoplasmic proteins in ways that constrain their translational diffusion. There is an apparent contradiction between the results on the cell physiology of truncated molecules and the measurements of their translational diffusion. Results of endocytosis experiments indicate that the molecules are coupled to the cell cytoskeleton and that this coupling is lost with truncation since internalization is affected by truncation. On the other hand, the results of translational diffusion experiments suggest that even wild-type, 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: D0~t, translational diffusion coefficient; FPR, fluorescence photobleachin 8 and recovery; MCF, mean channel fluorescence; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PKC, protein kinase C. full-length molecules are not directly linked to the cytoskeleton since truncation of their cytoplasmic domains has no effect on D,.,. This contradiction may arise largely because translational diffusion and endocytosis of truncated molecules have been studied in different cell types. D~ of the truncated class I MHC mutants has been measured in L cells, in which class I molecules are not rapidly internalized. The effect of truncation on endocytosis of the same mutants is readily shown when they are expressed in T lymphoma cells, a cell type in which there is continuous cycling of class I MHC antigens between the surface and cytoplasm (4) . Similarly, D,,, of truncated EGF receptor was measured in COS cells, while effects of truncation on endocytosis of EGF receptor were shown in 3T3 cells (2) . Here we present the first results in which D,a, of truncated transmembrane molecules is measured in cells in which the wild-type molecules are functional. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain affects D,a, in these cells; in the extreme truncation mutant, the D,,, is an order of magnitude larger than that of the wild-type molecule."
PCAF interacts with XBP-1S and mediates XBP-1S-dependent transcription,"X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is a key regulator required for cellular unfolded protein response (UPR) and plasma cell differentiation. In addition, involvement of XBP-1 in host cell-virus interaction and transcriptional regulation of viruses, such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), has been revealed recently. Two XBP-1 isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S, which share an identical N-terminal domain, are present in cells. XBP-1S is a transcription activator while XBP-1U is the inactive isoform. Although the transactivation domain of XBP-1S has been identified within the XBP-1Sspecific C-terminus, molecular mechanism of the transcriptional activation by XBP-1S still remains unknown. Here we report the interaction between p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and XBP-1S through the C-terminal domain of XBP-1S. No binding between XBP-1U and PCAF is detected. In a cell-based reporter assay, overexpression of PCAF further stimulates the XBP-1S-mediated cellular and HTLV-1 transcription while knockdown of PCAF exhibits the opposite effect. Expression of endogenous XBP-1S cellular target genes, such as BiP and CHOP, is significantly inhibited when PCAF is knocked down. Furthermore, PCAF is recruited to the promoters of XBP-1S target genes in vivo, in a XBP-1S-dependent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PCAF mediates the XBP-1Sdependent transcription through the interaction with XBP-1S.","INTRODUCTION X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) belongs to the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family of transcription factors. XBP-1 plays a major role in regulating unfolded protein response (UPR), which is triggered when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is under stress (1) . XBP-1 has two protein isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S. Both isoforms share a common N-terminus containing a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain which is required for DNA binding. XBP-1U is the dominant isoform under non-stress conditions. Activation of UPR induces the endoribonuclease activity of inositol requiring enzyme 1, an ER transmembrane protein, which removes 26 nts from the open-reading frame of XBP-1 mRNA (2) . This unconventional splicing occurs in cytoplasm and causes a frame shift at amino acid 165 of XBP-1, leading to the generation of XBP-1S by replacing the C-terminus of XBP-1U with a strong transactivation domain (2, 3) . XBP-1S is a transcription activator that up-regulates the expression of ER chaperones and other genes involved in membrane synthesis and the pathway of protein secretion (4, 5) . Overexpression of XBP-1S increases the secretory capacity of the cell and improves recombinant protein productivity in secretion-limited mammalian cells by expanding the surface area and volume of ER (5, 6) . It has been shown recently that high-level expression of recombinant secreted proteins in cells and environmental stresses during culture also induce the generation of XBP-1S (7) . XBP-1S is also found to be essential in the terminal differentiation of the antibody producing plasma cells by enhancing the secretory machinery of the cell (8, 9) . The XBP-1-knockout B cells display impaired immunoglobulin secretion, which can be restored by ectopic expression of XBP-1S (8) . Furthermore, the involvement of XBP-1 in tumorigenesis has been reported recently (10) (11) (12) ."
Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 in the Control of Cellular Responses to Genotoxic Stress,"Error-free replication and repair of DNA are pivotal to organisms for faithful transmission of their genetic information. Cells orchestrate complex signaling networks that sense and resolve DNA damage. Post-translational protein modifications by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, including SUMO and NEDD8, are critically involved in DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA damage tolerance (DDT). The expression of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), the first identified ubiquitin-like protein, has recently been shown to be induced under various DNA damage conditions, such as exposure to UV, camptothecin, and doxorubicin. Here we overview the recent findings on the role of ISG15 and its conjugation to target proteins (e.g., p53, Np63, and PCNA) in the control of cellular responses to genotoxic stress, such as the inhibition of cell growth and tumorigenesis.","Cells continuously encounter a wide variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stresses that damage the integrity of DNA (Lindahl and Barnes, 2000) . Mitochondrial respiratory chain generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are the most prevalent intrinsic source of DNA damage. Extrinsic sources of DNA damage are ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and genotoxic chemical agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., camptothecin, doxorubicin, and etoposide). Both of the sources attack DNA and produce DNA lesions or breaks (Dipple, 1995) . If not properly repaired, these damages are capable of blocking DNA replication and transcription, leading to mutations or genome aberrations, which consequently give rise to various human diseases, such as cancer."
Studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platform,"Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using highthroughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.","Variation in the human genome occurs on multiple levels, from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to duplications or deletions of contiguous blocks of DNA sequences (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Copy number variation (CNV) is an important polymorphism of DNA segments across a wide range of sizes and one of the primary sources of variation in the human genome (6) . Recently, CNV has been studied extensively because of its close association with large numbers of human disorders (7, 8) . An understanding of this variation is important not only to understand the full spectrum of human genetic variation but also to assess the significance of such variation in disease-association studies. The first human CNV map was constructed from a study of 270 normal individuals with a total of 1447 CNV regions in the whole genome (9) ; more than 15 000 CNVs have been found in the human genome (http://projects. tcag.ca/variation). A recent paper demonstrated the presence of 525 novel insertion sequences across the genomes of eight unrelated individuals, which were not present in the human reference genome, and showed that many of these have different copy numbers (10) . However, the current CNV analysis is mainly dependent upon microarray-based SNP and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) platforms, or DNA sequencing, and is therefore subject to low sensitivity and low resolution. These techniques are high throughput but lack the flexibility of analyzing individual genes or sequences of interest. Other existing technologies, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are limited because of their inability to reliably distinguish less than a twofold difference in copy number of a particular gene in DNA samples (11) (12) (13) ."
SHIP deficiency causes Crohn's disease-like ileitis,"Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can arise from genetic mutations that compromise intestinal epithelial cell integrity or immune regulation. SHIP has previously been shown to play a pivotal role in limiting the number of immunoregulatory cells and their function. Aim To determine whether SHIP plays a pivotal role in control of immune tolerance in the gut mucosa. Methods Gastrointestinal pathology was assessed in three separate strains of SHIP-deficient mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates. Gastrointestinal pathology was analysed in SHIP-deficient hosts reconstituted with WT haematopoietic cell grafts, and WT hosts reconstituted with SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cell grafts including whole splenocytes, purified T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Major immune cell populations were also analysed in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient mice and WT controls. Results SHIP-deficient mice developed segmental, transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis that recapitulated classical features of Crohn's disease enteric pathology. Analysis of haematopoietic chimeras showed that WT bone marrow reconstitution of SHIP À/À hosts corrects ileitis. Reconstitution with SHIP À/À splenocytes transferred ileitis to WT hosts. Adoptive transfer of purified SHIP À/À T cells or NK cells to WT hosts did not transfer ileitis. There was a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestines of SHIP-deficient mice; however, neutrophil numbers were significantly increased.","Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect various sites within the gastrointestinal tract, but classically the ileum, which leads to abdominal cramping, diarrhoea and gastrointestinal bleeding. 1e4 CD histopathological lesions begin with the formation of multiple aphthoid ulcers infiltrated by neutrophils, which progress and coalesce into sharply delimited, regional, transmural inflammations with granuloma formation, thickening of the muscularis propria, strictures, fissures and fistulas. 1e4 Although genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 susceptibility loci for IBD that disturb either intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier homeostasis or immune effector cell functions and interactions with luminal flora and antigens, 5e7 many susceptibility genes possess differing functions in IEC and haematopoietic cells, and primary IEC or immunological defects in genetically susceptible individuals often remain enigmatic. 8 9 Primary immunological alterations proposed to contribute to the development of CD pathology include increased expression of Th1-polarising cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon g by cells in the lamina propria, 10 11 aberrant IL-23initiated Th17-associated immune responses, 12 13 defects in regulatory T cell (Treg) modulation of effector functions via transforming growth factor b or IL-10 dependent mechanisms, 14 aberrant B-cell specificity and serum autoreactivity 15 and myeloid cell dysfunction. 16 That primary defects in immune cell function contribute to CD in some patients is supported by reports of disease remission following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 17 This paper is freely available online under the BMJ Journals unlocked scheme, see http:// gut.bmj.com/site/about/ unlocked.xhtml"
ERKs and mitochondria-related pathways are essential for glycyrrhizic acid-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity in differentiated PC12 cells,"The present study focuses on the neuroprotective effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA, a major compound separated from Glycyrrhiza Radix, which is a crude Chinese traditional drug) against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. The results showed that GA treatment improved cell viability and ameliorated abnormal glutamate-induced alterations in mitochondria in DPC12 cells. GA reversed glutamate-suppressed B-cell lymphoma 2 levels, inhibited glutamateenhanced expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, and reduced cytochrome C (Cyto C) release. Exposure to glutamate strongly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs); however, GA pretreatment enhanced activation of ERKs but not AKT. The presence of PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase [MEK] inhibitor) but not LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor) diminished the potency of GA for improving viability of glutamate-exposed DPC12 cells. These results indicated that ERKs and mitochondriarelated pathways are essential for the neuroprotective effect of GA against glutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells. The present study provides experimental evidence supporting GA as a potential therapeutic agent for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","The excitatory amino acid glutamate serves as a fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1) , and excitotoxicity and oxidative toxicity are considered to be two major pathways responsible for glutamateinduced toxicity (2, 3) . Excessive release of glutamate leading to excitotoxicity is responsible for neuronal injury associated with many acute and chronic brain diseases, such as brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders (4, 5) ."
A Mouse Model for Betacoronavirus Subgroup 2c Using a Bat Coronavirus Strain HKU5 Variant,"Cross-species transmission of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) can result in pandemic disease outbreaks. Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, has caused 182 cases to date, with~43% mortality, and no small animal model has been reported. MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (␤-CoV) subgroup 2c share >65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are significant drug and vaccine targets. BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c ␤-CoVs. We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE). This virus replicates efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge. Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice. Passaged virus was characterized by mutations in the nsp13, nsp14, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) and M genes. Finally, we identified an inhibitor active against the nsp5 proteases of subgroup 2c ␤-CoVs. Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad-based therapeutics, evaluating vaccine outcomes, and studying viral pathogenesis.","acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused an epidemic in 2002 to 2003 that resulted in 10 to 50% age-dependent mortality (5, 6) ."
A high-throughput approach to profile RNA structure,"Here we introduce the Computational Recognition of Secondary Structure (CROSS) method to calculate the structural profile of an RNA sequence (singleor double-stranded state) at single-nucleotide resolution and without sequence length restrictions. We trained CROSS using data from high-throughput experiments such as Selective 2 -Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE; Mouse and HIV transcriptomes) and Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure (PARS; Human and Yeast transcriptomes) as well as high-quality NMR/X-ray structures (PDB database). The algorithm uses primary structure information alone to predict experimental structural profiles with >80% accuracy, showing high performances on large RNAs such as Xist (17 900 nucleotides; Area Under the ROC Curve AUC of 0.75 on dimethyl sulfate (DMS) experiments). We integrated CROSS in thermodynamics-based methods to predict secondary structure and observed an increase in their predictive power by up to 30%.","The structure of an RNA determines its interactions and functions (1, 2) . RNA structure can be studied using lowthroughput techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. More recent approaches have started to exploit biochemical reactions to perform high-throughput profiling of the RNA structure: Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure (PARS) distinguishes doubleand single-stranded regions using the catalytic activity of two enzymes, RNase V1 (able to cut double-stranded nucleotides) and S1 (able to cut single-stranded nucleotides) (3, 4) , while Selective 2 -Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) (5,6) employs highly reactive chemical probes such as 1M6, NMIA (SHAPE) and NAI-N 3 (icSHAPE) to characterize RNA backbone flexibility. Another technique based on dimethyl sulfate (DMS) (7) is often used for in vivo probing of transcriptomes (8, 9) . DMS experiments are of high quality due to the smaller size of the (CH 3 O) 2 SO 2 probe, yet have low coverage, since the alkylating agent only reacts to adenine and cytosine."
Randomized controlled clinical trial on the effect of oral immunoglobulin supplementation on neonatal dairy calves with diarrhea,Background: Nonantibiotic alternatives providing local gut immunity have been recommended for managing calf diarrhea.,"growth-like factor, 2 epidermal growth factor, 3 transforming growth factor-β, 4 and platelet-derived growth factor. 1 Colostral immunoglobulins provide defense in both treatment and prevention of viral and bacterial infections, whereas growth factors promote gut integrity and mucosal recovery in cattle with diarrhea 5 through differentiation of both immature and mature cells in the gastrointestinal tract. [6] [7] [8] Consequently, the benefits of feeding bovine colostrum or colostrum supplements in human patients with diarrhea have been investigated with variable outcomes. Oral supplementation with a bovine colostrum supplement in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection-associated diarrhea results in a dramatic decrease in stool evacuations per day, decrease in self-estimated fatigue, and an increase in body weight. 9 In contrast, supplementation with bovine colostrum in human patients with short bowel syndrome results in an increase in diarrhea with no improvement in intestinal absorption. 10 Diarrhea is the most common disease condition in preweaned dairy calves in the United States, accounting for 56.4% of deaths. 11 In nonsick calves, oral supplementation with immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 2 to 14 days of age reduced frequency of occurrence of diarrhea, and improved daily weight gain. 12 Oral administration of colostrum or immunoglobulin supplements might provide local immunity in the gastrointestinal tract of calves, thereby reducing frequency and/or preventing the occurrence of diarrhea."

According to the World Health Organization )WHO( International Health Regulations mandate WHO member states to ensure that every designated point of entry is equipped with staff and instruments enabling smooth movements of the travellers while maintaining appropriate public health measures. 1 Maintaining such regulations is likely to enhance proper travellers' movement during public health emergencies by reducing possible interference between application of preventive public health measures, and the ability of travellers to access the designated points of entry. Additionally, ensuring the application of public health measures might aid in preventing the occurrence of any public health emergencies. A public health emergency is defined as any situation with health consequences that are likely to overwhelm the community's routine capability of addressing them. A health situation can be considered as an emergency if there is a risk due to timing, such as facing emerging diseases threats during Hajj season, scale, as with an overwhelming number of causalities, or due to the unpredictability of the situation. Defining the nature of potential public health emergencies is crucial to allow competent development of preparedness plans. 2 Having a large number of passengers arriving at a particular point of entry during a limited time is a burden on the available health services. A meticulous state of readiness is required to respond to any risk of spreading a communicable disease. The state of readiness is maintained by several steps including preparation of staff, equipment, and buildings. 3, 4 The burden of not maintaining effective public health event response measures is aggravated if an epidemic is announced in a particular region of the globe where travellers form these areas are scheduled to arrive in the country. During the Hajj season of 2014, the Ebola Virus Disease )EVD(, which is a viral hemorrhagic disease, was announced as an epidemic disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in West Africa. Additionally, a localized spread of the virus was announced in certain areas of Nigeria. 5 The Saudi Arabian government, as a preventive measure, decided to prevent citizens of EVD-affected countries from entering the country. However, nationals of Nigeria were exempt as no extended transmission of EVD was announced. 6, 7 Nonetheless, several procedures were applied to prevent the transmission of Ebola virus among thousands of Nigerian pilgrims arriving in the country. These measures were mainly related to exit screening of travellers in Nigeria, 8 and entry screening at points of entry in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia produced response plans for infectious diseases )Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS] and EVD( to be implemented during Hajj. 9 There are many potential sources of infectious disease transmission from a single infected individual. The presence of infected travellers, such as an EVD infection, on an aircraft increases the risk of transmitting infection to neighboring passengers and flight crew. Airport workers, such as ground workers handling cleaning of aircrafts and lavatories, are at risk of the infection, especially with the presence of spilled infectious materials. Airport workers handling the flow of passengers during busy times are at risk of acquiring infection such as immigration, customs, security, and healthcare workers. Therefore, all of these individuals have to be aware of the potential health threats at the airport, should be aware of preventive methods, how to use preventive methods, and know what to do when facing a public health emergency event in the airport. Prince Mohammed Airport )Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia( workers' level of knowledge of the potential health threat at the airport is currently not known. Additionally, the attitude and practice of the staff when a public health emergency is announced in the airport is not measured. The significance of this study stems from the ability to investigate the degree to which airport workers, at the time of dealing with travellers during Hajj season, were able to deal with potential urgent infectious cases, and to adhere to the relevant protective guidelines.

,"are useful and will be translated into actions and change in the system. Based on Taiwan's experiences, early stakeholder engagement and an experts' pre-JEE pilot visit would contribute to a successful JEE process.","T he beginning of the 21st century has been marked by a series of epidemics and pandemics, including extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDRTB) worldwide, anthrax in the United States, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in East Asia and Canada, avian influenza [A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)] in Southeast Asia and China, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East and South Korea, Ebola virus disease in West Africa, and, most recently, Zika virus disease in the Americas. These emerging infectious diseases as a global health burden are thought to be driven, at least partly, by the emergence and spread of new pathogens; globalization of travel, food, and medicines; the rise of antimicrobial resistance; and intentional engineering or accidental release of biohazard agents. 1 The morbidity, mortality, and economic impact of such public health threats can be enormous. For example, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa during 2014-15 was estimated to have resulted in approximately 28,000 human cases, at least 11,000 deaths, and economic loss of more than $30 billion. 2, 3 In response to international public health emergencies such as SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) , which require that all countries have the capability to detect, assess, report, and respond-that is, detect potential threats through surveillance systems and laboratories, make decisions in public health emergencies, report specific diseases and any potential international public health emergencies, and respond to public health events. 4 However, the WHO reported that by 2012, fewer than 20% of the countries had met the IHR goals, and by 2014, only approximately 30% of the countries were fully prepared to detect and respond to an outbreak. 5 In the wake of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, several high-level panel reports highlighted the pitfalls of relying solely on a government's voluntary self-assessment to measure core capacities. [6] [7] [8] The panels unanimously recommended that all countries should commit to participate in regular, independent peer review or external assessment of their core capacities. In the 68th World Health Assembly in 2015, the IHR Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation recommended that countries move from exclusive self-evaluation to approaches that combine selfevaluation, peer review, and voluntary external evaluations involving a combination of domestic and independent experts. 5 In light of this, WHO, in collaboration with the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) launched in February 2014, developed the Joint External Evaluation ( JEE) process and JEE tool in February 2016 as part of the IHR (2005) Monitoring and Evaluation framework. 9 The JEE tool integrated the GHSA assessment tool, which was intended to assess country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats independently of whether they are naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. Countries are encouraged to request a JEE mission to help them identify the most urgent needs in their health system with the expectation that the JEE can help engage with stakeholders and partners to support a country's preparedness for outbreaks and health emergencies. Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Tanzania, and the United States were among the first countries to have completed and published an external full assessment using the JEE tool. 10 Taiwan's Commitment to Participation in JEE Taiwan had a population of 23.5 million and a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $489.2 billion in 2013, when it was rated the world's 20th largest economy and the 5th largest economy in Asia. The 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia, including Taiwan, and the subsequent public health threat from avian influenza, MERS, and Zika outbreaks in the region, have repeatedly tested Taiwan's preparedness for public health emergencies and illustrated the urgent need to establish a systematic approach to prevent, detect, and respond to human and animal disease threats, particularly through multilateral and multisectoral collaboration, including domestic and international partnerships."
"An insight into the diverse roles of surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-D in innate and adaptive immunity","Surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic, collagen-containing calcium-dependent lectins, which appear to have a range of innate immune functions at pulmonary as well as extrapulmonary sites. These proteins bind to target ligands on pathogens, allergens, and apoptotic cells, via C-terminal homotrimeric carbohydrate recognition domains, while the collagen region brings about the effector functions via its interaction with cell surface receptors. SP-A and SP-D deal with various pathogens, using a range of innate immune mechanisms such as agglutination/aggregation, enhancement of phagocytosis, and killing mechanisms by phagocytic cells and direct growth inhibition. SP-A and SP-D have also been shown to be involved in the control of pulmonary inflammation including allergy and asthma. Emerging evidence suggest that SP-A and SP-D are capable of linking innate immunity with adaptive immunity that includes modulation of dendritic cell function and helper T cell polarization.This review enumerates immunological properties of SP-A and SP-D inside and outside lungs and discusses their importance in human health and disease.","Surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-D, are collagen-containing Ctype (calcium-dependent) lectins called collectins, which were originally identified as surfactant-associated proteins involved in pulmonary surfactant homeostasis (Weaver and Whitsett, 1991) . Subsequent studies involving structural and functional characterization of these proteins have suggested that SP-A and SP-D are potent innate immune molecules in the lungs that are involved in viral neutralization, clearance of bacteria, fungi, apoptotic and necrotic cells, down regulation of allergic reaction and resolution of inflammation (Kishore et al., , 2006 Wright, 2005) . Their primary structures include an N-terminal, triple-helical collagen region, and a C-terminal homotrimeric C-type lectin or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The trimeric CRDs can recognize carbohydrate or charge patterns on microbes, allergens, and dying cells acting as a soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) while the collagen region can interact with receptor molecules present on a variety of immune cells in order to initiate clearance mechanisms (Kishore et al., 2006) . SP-A and SP-D are large hydrophilic proteins, as opposed to SP-B and SP-C, the other two hydrophobic surfactant proteins found in the lungs. Their primary structure is organized into a Abbreviations: ALI, acute lung injury; AM, alveolar macrophages; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; DC, dendritic cells; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; NO, nitric oxide; PAP, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PG, prostaglandin; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SP-A, surfactant protein A; SP-D, surfactant protein D; SR-A, scavenger receptor A; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. cysteine-containing N-terminal region, a triple-helical collagen region composed of repeating Gly-X-Y triplets, an α-helical coiledcoil neck region, and a C-terminus comprising a C-type lectin or CRD region (reviewed in Kishore et al., 2006) . SP-A and SP-D are large oligomeric structures, each assembled from multiple copies of either one or two polypeptide chains. SP-A has a hexameric structure in which six structural subunits associate to form a molecule of 630 kDa made up of 18 chains. SP-D is composed of oligomers of a 130 kDa subunit comprising three identical polypeptide chains of 43 kDa. Human SP-D is assembled into a 520 kDa tetrameric structure with four of the homotrimeric subunits linked via their N-terminal regions, but multimers, trimers, dimers and monomers are also possible Kishore et al., 2006 ; Figures 1A,B) ."
"INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and Financing","In 2010, Yemen started the surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) by establishing 2 sentinel sites in Sana'a and Aden city. This study aims to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza viruses among SARI patients and to determine the severity of SARI and its associated factors. The data of SARI patients who were admitted to SARI surveillance sites at Al Johory hospital in Sana'a and Al Wahdah hospital in Aden city during the period 2011-2016 were analyzed. The proportions of positive influenza viruses (type A, B) and noninfluenza viruses (respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, human parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and fatality rate among SARI patients were calculated. A total of 1811 of SARI patients were admitted during 2011-2016. Of those, 78% were <15 years old. A total of 89 (5%) patients had influenza viruses and 655 (36%) had noninfluenza viruses. The overall ICU admission rate was 40% and the case-fatality rate was 8%. Infection by influenza type (A, B) and mixed (adenovirus, human parainfluenza) was significantly associated with lower ICU admission. Age <15 years old, infection with influenza B, pre-existence of chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site were significantly associated with higher fatality rate among patients. In conclusion; SARI patients in Yemen had a high ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Influenza type B, chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site are associated with higher fatality rate. Expanding surveillance sites and panel of laboratory tests to involve other pathogens will help to provide accurate diagnosis for SARI etiology and give more comprehensive picture. Training staff for SARI case management will help to reduce severe outcomes.","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a group of diseases that are caused by different microorganisms where viral etiologies are responsible for 80% of cases. 1 Influenza and noninfluenza viruses are responsible for significant annual morbidity and mortality across all age groups. 2 On average, influenza viruses infect 5% to 15% of the global population, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and between 260 000 and 650 000 deaths every year worldwide. The heaviest burden is among high-risk groups that include pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions. 3 In 2015, it was estimated to cause 3.2 million hospital admissions and 59 600 hospital deaths in children below 5 years of age worldwide. 4, 5 Efforts were made to assess the role of noninfluenza viruses in morbidity and mortality of ARIs. Surveillance for hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) is an important public health tool used to identify etiologies to understand the disease, track changes in circulating influenza viruses and as an alert mechanism for potential pandemic viruses 6 For that purpose, the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance (EMARIS) network was established in 2007 and initiated sentinel-site surveillance for SARI in Egypt, Jordan, and Oman. This was achieved through the collaboration of Ministries of Health, partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU3), and the World Health Organization (WHO). 7 Yemen joined EMARIS network in 2010 and established 2 surveillance sites for SARI in Sana'a and Aden. However, limited information about SARI, influenza, and noninfluenza respiratory viruses is available in Yemen. Few studies were carried out to describe the mortality after influenza epidemic, 8 estimate the proportion of influenza and noninfluenza viruses and mortality among SARI patients, 9 and to understand the clinical characteristics of SARI associated with most detected pathogens during 2014-2015. 10 Still, there is gap in the information related to the role of influenza and noninfluenza viruses in severe outcome of SARI and associated factors. This study aimed to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza virus among SARI patients, and assess the severity of SARI and its associated factors in Yemen."
One cannot rule them all: Are bacterial toxins-antitoxins druggable?,"One sentence summary: We consider various approaches to develop the toxins of the type II family as possible candidates to drug discovery; druggability of toxins-antitoxins could be possible as antivirals. As antibacterials, they might be considered as druggable but delivery and formulation may not be simple so far.","Humans have long searched for all kind of medicines that could cure their bodies, restore their health and prolong their short lifespan. Thereby, search for a panákeia (pan = all; akés = a cure) as a universal drug that could overcome all kind of diseases started as early as Medicine itself. Such an ecumenical view also appears within the tolkienian fantasy, where there was the One Ring of Power, the One that would rule all the lesser magical rings (http://www.tolkien.co.uk). Unfortunately, there was no One Ring in real life; sadly enough to say, a panacea also does not exist, at least for now. Back to the reality, in this review, we will focus on the present problems of the emerging antimicrobial resistance of many pathogenic bacteria as well as spread of viral infections. We will discuss that there is an impending need to research on the discovery of novel antimicrobials, to find alternatives to classical treatments as well as to use novel approaches that will provide not only one, but multiple solutions to tackle human infections. We shall also discuss the possible (Davies, 2010 #4750) b Not widely used due to high-resistant bacteria. c Vancomycin was considered as the 'last' antibiotic. Mechanisms of resistance to this antibiotic were reported by (Walsh, 1996 #4751) . d Hardly used due to low effectiveness."
Pre-Treatment with Zirconia Nanoparticles Reduces Inflammation Induced by the Pathogenic H5N1 Influenza Virus,"Background: New approaches are urgently needed to fight influenza viral infection. Previous research has shown that zirconia nanoparticles can be used as anticancer materials, but their antiviral activity has not been reported. Here, we investigated the antiviral effect of zirconia (ZrO 2 ) nanoparticles (NPs) against a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Materials and Methods: In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO 2 on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. Results: Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO 2 activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO 2 treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.","In recent years, a large number of rapidly-spreading viral outbreaks have placed considerable demands on healthcare infrastructure, sparking global concern. 1,2 The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, 3 the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, 4-6 pandemics of the H5N1 and H5N7 strains of influenza A virus (IAV), 7 and the devastating Ebola and Zika virus epidemics of 2014 and 2015 illustrate the severity of these outbreaks. 8, 9 Among these viruses, avian influenza virus H5N1 has attracted a great deal of attention due to its rapid spread and high pathogenicity worldwide. 10, 11 The leading cause of death in infected patients is diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhage in the lungs, which is caused by overactive inflammatory responses. 12, 13 Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines in H5N1-infected mice and humans, referred to as a cytokine storm, has been identified as the main cause of death associated with this virus. 14, 15 Vaccination remains the most effective preventive measure against influenza viruses. Nevertheless, vaccination effectiveness is decreasing as new variants arise through antigenic drifts or shifts. 16 Although some antiviral drugs such as zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are currently in use, the increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains affects their clinical application. 17, 18 Therefore, development of novel broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic agents against IAV is urgently needed."

A Novel Pathogenic Mammalian Orthoreovirus from Diarrheic Pigs and Swine Blood Meal in the United States,"Since May 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea have devastated the U.S. swine industry, causing immense economic losses. Two different swine enteric coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Delta coronavirus) have been isolated from the affected swine population. The disease has been reported from at least 32 states of the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, and Ukraine, with repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from diarrheic feces of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal from multiple sources. MRV3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states. Several MRV3 isolates were obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or developing chicken embryos. Biological characterization of two representative isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90°C. NextGen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the S1 segment to mammalian and bat MRV3. Neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection. Therefore, the novel porcine MRV3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine enteric viruses. The role of MRV3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in the United States remains to be determined, but the pathogenic nature of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence.",thoreovirus type 3 (MRV3) in feces of pigs from these outbreaks and ring-dried swine blood meal (RDSB). We have also reproduced severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis in neonatal pigs experimentally infected with purified MRV3 strains.
Evaluation of Measles Vaccine Virus as a Vector to Deliver Respiratory Syncytial Virus Fusion Protein or Epstein-Barr Virus Glycoprotein gp350,"Live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine virus (MV) Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) strain was evaluated as a viral vector to express the ectodomains of fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV F) or glycoprotein 350 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV gp350) as candidate vaccines for prophylaxis of RSV and EBV. The glycoprotein gene was inserted at the 1 st or the 3 rd position of the measles virus genome and the recombinant viruses were generated. Insertion of the foreign gene at the 3 rd position had a minimal impact on viral replication in vitro. RSV F or EBV gp350 protein was secreted from infected cells. In cotton rats, EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV-and insert-specific antibody responses. In addition, both vaccines also induced insert specific interferon gamma (IFN-) secreting T cell response. EZ-RSV F protected cotton rats from pulmonary replication of RSV A2 challenge infection. In rhesus macaques, although both EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV specific neutralizing antibody responses, only RSV F specific antibody response was detected. Thus, the immunogenicity of the foreign antigens delivered by measles vaccine virus is dependent on the nature of the insert and the animal models used for vaccine evaluation.","Live attenuated viruses have been developed and used to help protect humans from various infectious diseases. Live attenuated vaccine viruses simulate natural infection and are highly immunogenic and effective in inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Because of their demonstrated safety and effectiveness against infectious diseases, different live attenuated vaccine viruses have been explored as vectors to express heterologous antigens [1] . Measles vaccine (MV) strain has a long history of demonstrated safety in humans. It induces long lasting immunity including antibody and T cell responses [2] [3] [4] . Aerosol administration of measles vaccine is also being developed and has been shown to induce similar or better immunogenicity compared to conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccination [5, 6] . This aerosol administration route may offer advantages in helping to protect individuals from mucosal pathogens."
Isolation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus from a Patient of the 2015 Korean Outbreak,"During the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korea, 186 persons were infected, resulting in 38 fatalities. We isolated MERS-CoV from the oropharyngeal sample obtained from a patient of the outbreak. Cytopathic effects showing detachment and rounding of cells were observed in Vero cell cultures 3 days after inoculation of the sample. Spherical virus particles were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Full-length genome sequence of the virus isolate was obtained and phylogenetic analyses showed that it clustered with clade B of MERS-CoV.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a betacoronavirus causing a severe acute respiratory infection (1, 2) . It was first isolated from the sputum of a patient with severe pneumonia in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (3) . Since then, 26 countries have reported 1,618 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 579 fatalities (4) ."
Improving the Hospital Quality of Care during Winter Periods by Optimizing Budget Allocation Between Rotavirus Vaccination and Bed Expansion,"Background During each winter the hospital quality of care (QoC) in pediatric wards decreases due to a surge in pediatric infectious diseases leading to overcrowded units. Bed occupancy rates often surpass the good hospital bed management threshold of 85%, which can result in poor conditions in the workplace. This study explores how QoCscores could be improved by investing in additional beds and/or better vaccination programs against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Methods The Cobb-Douglas model was selected to define the improvement in QoC (%) as a function of two strategies (rotavirus vaccination coverage [%] and addition of extra hospital beds [% of existing beds]), allowing improvementisocurves to be produced. Subsequently, budget minimization was applied to determine the combination of the two strategies needed to reach a given QoC improvement at the lowest cost. Data from Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) were chosen as an example. The annual population in the catchment area to be vaccinated was 7000 children; the winter period was 90 days with 34 pediatric beds available. Rotavirus vaccination cost per course was €118.26 and the daily cost of a pediatric bed was €436.53. The target QoC increase was fixed at 50%. The model was first built with baseline parameter values. Results The model predicted that a combination of 64% vaccine coverage and 39% extra hospital beds (& 13 extra beds) in winter would improve QoC-scores by 50% for the minimum budget allocation. Conclusion The model allows determination of the most efficient allocation of the healthcare budget between rotavirus vaccination and bed expansion for improving QoCscores during the annual epidemic winter seasons.","Infectious diseases in children remain a serious health problem in hospital care during each winter period in highincome countries despite the application of strict hygienic measures and better treatment procedures. Respiratory diseases and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) peak during winter leading to overcrowded pediatric wards with high bed occupancy rates exceeding 85% on average, which is the threshold for operating efficiently in hospital bedmanagement [1] [2] [3] . The temporary shock in bed-demand reduces the quality of care (QoC) because of high occupancies, discharges, and unplanned returns of patients but also because of stress in healthcare workers expressed through sick leave, extra working hours, and the enrollment of interim workers [4] . Among the covariates underlying the two principal factors (bed-and staff-management) defining the hospital QoC-scores, high bed occupancy is the main driver [4] . In addition, a high concentration of infections in hospital care will result in increased nosocomial infections and in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] ."
"Unrealistic Optimism, Sex, and Risk Perception of Type 2 Diabetes Onset: Implications for Education Programs","This study examined links among unrealistic optimism, sex, and risk perception of type 2 diabetes onset in college students. Participants included 660 college students who consented to complete a questionnaire. The results showed significant differences between students who perceived that they were at risk for type 2 diabetes onset and those who thought their peers were the ones at risk. A higher prevalence of participants thought their peers were the ones at risk for type 2 diabetes. Women were more likely than men to report a higher risk perception, indicating that their peers were at lower risk for diabetes onset.","H istorically, type 2 diabetes was usually diagnosed in individuals ≥40 years of age. However, as reported by the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (1) between 2001 and 2005, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among younger age-groups (<20 years of age) more than doubled. There has also been an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among people in their 30s (2) (3) (4) . In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 25.6 million people ≥20 years of age and 215,000 individuals <20 years of age are affected by diabetes (5). Diabetes is now the leading cause of chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence in the United States (1, 6) . Because type 2 diabetes affects children and adolescents, college students are not exempt from developing diabetes. Therefore, there is a need to assess college students' perception of their risk for developing type 2 diabetes and to tailor appropriate messages to meet their needs."
INDUCIBILITY OF la ANTIGEN ON ASTROCYTES BY MURINE CORONAVIRUS JHM IS RAT STRAIN DEPENDENT,"Infection of Lewis rats with the murine coronavirus JHM leads to a persistent infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and a disease process that shares some features with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (1-4). After an incubation period of weeks, a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) develops that is characterized by paralysis (2). Histologically, the main lesion consists of a primary demyelination associated with perivascular cuffings and a cellular infiltration of macrophages as well as helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (1, 2) . SDE animals reveal a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response to myelin basic protein (MBP) as documented in adoptive transfer experiments (1). In addition, genetic experiments demonstrate that Brown-Norway (BN) rats are resistant to SDE, similar to what has been observed in EAE (4) . These findings indicate an immunopathological reaction in coronavirus-induced SDE in Lewis rats that is lacking in BN rats.","Infection of Lewis rats with the murine coronavirus JHM leads to a persistent infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and a disease process that shares some features with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (1) (2) (3) (4) .

A Systems Biology Approach to Infectious Disease Research: Innovating the Pathogen-Host Research Paradigm,"The twentieth century was marked by extraordinary advances in our understanding of microbes and infectious disease, but pandemics remain, food and waterborne illnesses are frequent, multidrug-resistant microbes are on the rise, and the needed drugs and vaccines have not been developed. The scientific approaches of the past-including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology-have not been sufficient to address these challenges. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods. These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions. To take full advantage of these innovations, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently initiated the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. As participants of the Systems Biology Program, we think that the time is at hand to redefine the pathogen-host research paradigm.","I nfectious diseases continue to be major health concerns worldwide: hepatitis C, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) are ongoing pandemics. A third of the world population is currently infected with the TB bacillus; millions of people are infected by influenza virus annually; and even though therapeutic drugs have slowed the threat of HIV-1, there is still no definitive cure or viable vaccine in sight. Although influenza virus vaccines provide protection, they must be reformulated annually, and the time lag from the spread of a pandemic virus to the availability of a vaccine is far too long. A universal vaccine against influenza virus is needed to limit high levels of morbidity and mortality. Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, avian H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and dengue fever are a constant threat; and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella outbreaks in the food industry, are costly to society."
Histidine-rich Modification of a Scorpion-derived Peptide Improves Bioavailability and Inhibitory Activity against HSV-1,"Rationale: HSV is one of the most widespread human viral pathogens. HSV-1 infects a large portion of the human population and causes severe diseases. The current clinical treatment for HSV-1 is based on nucleoside analogues, the use of which is limited due to drug resistance, side effects and poor bioavailability. AMPs have been identified as potential antiviral agents that may overcome these limitations. Therefore, we screened anti-HSV-1 peptides from a scorpion-derived AMP library and engineered one candidate into a histidine-rich peptide with significantly improved antiviral activity and development potential. Methods: A venomous gland cDNA library was constructed from the scorpion Euscorpiops validus in the Yunnan Province of China. Six putative AMPs were characterized from this cDNA library, and the synthesized peptides were screened via plaque-forming assays to determine their virucidal potential. Time of addition experiments according to the infection progress of HSV-1 were used to identify the modes of action for peptides of interest. The histidine-rich modification was designed based on structural analysis of peptides by a helical wheel model and CD spectroscopy. Peptide cellular uptake and distribution were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Results: The peptide Eval418 was found to have high clearance activity in an HSV-1 plaque reduction assay. Eval418 exhibited dose-dependent and time-dependent inactivation of HSV-1 and dose-dependent inhibition of HSV-1 attachment to host cells. However, Eval418 scarcely suppressed an established HSV-1 infection due to poor cellular uptake. We further designed and modified Eval418 into four histidine-rich derivative peptides with enhanced antiviral activities and lower cytotoxicities. All of the derivative peptides suppressed established HSV-1 infections. One of these peptides, Eval418-FH5, not only had strong viral inactivation activity and enhanced attachment inhibitory activity but also had high inhibitory activity against intracellular HSV-1, which was consistent with its improved intracellular uptake and distribution as confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Conclusion: We successfully identified an anti-HSV-1 peptide, Eval418, from a scorpion venom peptide library and designed a histidine-rich Eval418 derivative with significantly improved potential for further development as an anti-HSV-1 drug. This successful modification can provide a design strategy to improve the bioavailability, cellular distribution and antiviral activity of peptide agents.","Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) is one of the most common human pathogens, infecting 70-90% of the human population [1] . Humans are the only natural hosts of HSV, and HSV infection is almost exclusively limited to epithelial cells and peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons [2] . HSV can cause diseases ranging from mild conditions to lethal infections, including mucocutaneous lesions in labialis and skin, herpes keratitis and herpes encephalitis [3] . Most of the licensed treatments are based on nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir. However, current treatments are unable to prevent establishment of latency and reactivation of latent virus [4] . Due to the drug resistance, side effects, and poor bioavailability associated with current treatments and the lack of an effective HSV-1 vaccine, the discovery and development of novel anti-HSV-1 agents are still urgent."
Plasma and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity and plasma equilibrium concentrations of angiotensin peptides in dogs with heart disease,"Background: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and produces angiotensin peptides (APs), such as angiotensin 1-9 and 1-7 that are vasodilatory and natriuretic, and act to counterbalance angiotensin II.","The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart disease and heart failure in dogs. [1] [2] [3] [4] The traditional concept of the RAAS is as follows: cardiac disease, as well as treatments for cardiac disease, such as diuretics, decrease perfusion of the kidney, activating release of renin, which converts angiotensinogen to the 10-amino acid peptide, angiotensin I (AT1 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ). Subsequently, the dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cleaves 2 amino acids from the C-terminus of AT1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) to form the octapeptide, angiotensin II (AT2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ). Angiotensin II acts primarily through angiotensin receptor type 1 and causes potent vasoconstriction, sodium and water conservation, aldosterone release, and myocardial remodeling. 5 Thus, the traditional view of the RAAS is that of a linear and maladaptive pathological system that is overactive during heart failure and often suppressed using ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and aldosterone antagonists. This understanding changed with the discovery of a homologue of ACE, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 6, 7 Like ACE, ACE2 is a membrane-bound zinc metalloproteinase; the catalytic site of which is capable of binding various angiotensin peptides (APs), such as AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, ACE2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase and it removes only a single amino acid from the C-terminus of its catalytic substrate. 8, 9 For example, ACE2 acts on AT1(1-10) and AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) to produce a 9-amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1-9 (Ang1-9) and a 7-amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), respectively. 10 Despite being different by only 1 amino acid, the biological effects of Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 are opposite of those associated with AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Specifically, Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 are vasodilatory, natriuretic, diuretic, antifibrotic, and antiremodeling. 9 These beneficial APs mediate the majority of their effects by binding to angiotensin receptor type 2 or an endogenous orphan Mas receptor (MasR), as opposed to binding to ATR1. 11, 12 It is now known 9,13 that the ACE2 system provides an endogenous counterbalance to ACE and that an expanded view of the RAAS involves many different APs with structures differing by 1 to 5 amino acids. Thus, RAAS is considerably more complex than those traditionally viewed, and this discovery has uncovered a broad new set of molecules to explore, understand, and potentially modify in subjects with heart disease."
Severe outcomes associated with respiratory viruses in newborns and infants: a prospective viral surveillance study in Jordan,"Objective To assess virus-specific hospitalisation rates, risk factors for illness severity and seasonal trends in children hospitalised with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Design Prospective cohort study. setting A government hospital serving low-income and middle-income population in Amman, Jordan. Participants Children under 2 years of age hospitalised with fever and/or respiratory symptoms (n=3168) from 16 March 2010 to 31 March 2013. Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. Outcome measures Hospitalisation rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS) and death. results Of the 3168 subjects, 2581 (82%) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most predominant pathogen isolated. During admission, 1013 (32%) received oxygen therapy, 284 (9%) were admitted to ICU, 111 (4%) were placed on MV and 31 (1%) children died. Oxygen therapy was higher in RSV-only subjects compared with human rhinovirus-only (42%vs29%, p<0.001), adenovirus-only (42%vs21%, p<0.001) and human parainfluenza virusonly (42%vs23%, p<0.001) subjects. The presence of an underlying medical condition was associated with oxygen therapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.95, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.56), ICU admission (aOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.68), MV (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.28) and longer LOS (aOR1.71, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.13). Similarly, younger age was associated with oxygen therapy (0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), ICU admission (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), MV (0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53) and longer LOS (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59). Pneumonia was strongly associated with longer LOS (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.60), oxygen therapy (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.22 to 3.89), ICU admission (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.50) and MV (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.85 to 6.00). Virus-specific hospitalisation rates ranged from 0.5 to 10.5 per 1000 children. Conclusion Respiratory viruses are associated with severe illness in Jordanian children hospitalised with ARI. Prevention strategies such as extended breast feeding, increased access to palivizumab and RSV vaccine development could help decrease hospitalisation rates and illness severity, particularly in young children with underlying medical conditions.","Objective To assess virus-specific hospitalisation rates, risk factors for illness severity and seasonal trends in children hospitalised with acute respiratory infections (ARI).

Article Fast Track How and Why Overcome the Impediments to Resolution: Lessons from rhinolophid and hipposiderid Bats,"The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among the Old World leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideridae) and the closely related horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) remain unresolved. In this study, we generated a novel approximately 10-kb molecular data set of 19 nuclear exon and intron gene fragments for 40 bat species to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae. We estimated divergence times and explored potential reasons for any incongruent phylogenetic signal. We demonstrated the effects of outlier taxa and genes on phylogenetic reconstructions and compared the relative performance of intron and exon data to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses produced a well-resolved phylogeny, supporting the familial status of Hipposideridae and demonstrated the paraphyly of the largest genus, Hipposideros. A fossil-calibrated timetree and biogeographical analyses estimated that Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae diverged in Africa during the Eocene approximately 42 Ma. The phylogram, the timetree, and a unique retrotransposon insertion supported the elevation of the subtribe Rhinonycterina to family level and which is diagnosed herein. Comparative analysis of diversification rates showed that the speciose genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros underwent diversification during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The intron versus exon analyses demonstrated the improved nodal support provided by introns for our optimal tree, an important finding for large-scale phylogenomic studies, which typically rely on exon data alone. With the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a novel coronavirus, the study of these species is urgent as they are considered the natural reservoir for emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. It has been shown that host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines a virus's persistence, replicative ability, and can act as a predictor of new emerging disease. Therefore, this newly resolved phylogeny can be used to direct future assessments of viral diversity and to elucidate the origin and development of SARS-like coronaviruses in mammals.","The Hipposideridae, commonly known as the Old World leafnosed bats, are widespread and are distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the Old World extending from western Africa, throughout Australasia, and marginally into the Palearctic (Koopman 1994; Bogdanowicz and Owen 1998) . They consist of nine extant genera (see table 1 for classification) and at least 82 species (Simmons 2005) . The Rhinolophidae, commonly known as horseshoe bats, comprise 77 species encompassed in a single genus, Rhinolophus (Simmons 2005) . Rhinolophidae are found in diverse habitats throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the Old World (Nowak and Paradiso 1999) . Hipposideridae and their sister taxon, the Rhinolophidae, are of exceptional scientific interest, having arguably the most sophisticated echolocation system (Jones and Teeling 2006) and are considered as the reservoir host species for the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -like coronaviruses Drexler et al. 2010; Ar Gouilh et al. 2011; Anthony et al. 2013 )."
Stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting by antisense LNA,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism commonly used by RNA viruses to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA at a fixed ratio. An essential element in this process is the presence of an RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or a hairpin, located downstream of the slippery sequence. Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12-18 nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element.","Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding event that increases the versatility of gene expression. It is mainly utilized by eukaryotic RNA viruses (1) (2) (3) , though some prokaryotic (4) and mammalian genes (5) (6) (7) are also controlled by ribosomal frameshifting. The requirements for À1 ribosomal frameshifting are the presence of a slippery heptanucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ (where X can be A, U, G or C; Y can be A or U; and Z does not equal Y; the spaces indicate the original reading frame) (8) followed by a downstream structural element, such as a pseudoknot, a hairpin or an antisense oligonucleotide duplex [for reviews, see (9) ]. Although the mechanism of frameshifting is still elusive, a promising model has been proposed by Brierley and co-workers using cryo-electron microscopy to image mammalian 80S ribosomes (10) . In their model, the ribosome is paused by its inability to unwind a pseudoknot structure resulting in a blockage of the A-site by eEF-2. During translocation, the P-site tRNA is bent in the 3 0 -direction by opposing forces. To release the tension, the P-site tRNA may un-pair and subsequently re-pair in the À1 frame with a certain frequency, followed by A-site tRNA delivery into the new À1 reading frame. These and other recent data obtained by mechanical unfolding of frameshifter pseudoknots suggest that mRNA secondary structures with certain conformational features that resist ribosomal helicase-mediated unwinding and eEF-2 catalyzed translocation are key players in ribosomal frameshifting."
Production of specific IgY antibody to the recombinant FanC protein produced in Escherichia coli,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are one of the primary causes of diarrhea in newborn calves and in humans, pigs, and sheep. IgY technology has been identified as a promising alternative to generating a mass amount of specific antibody for use in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics. The purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody (IgY) to recombinant FanC protein from ETEC. Materials and Methods: FanC (K99) gene was amplified from ETEC by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction. The gene was cloned and subcloned into pTZ57R/T and pET32a (+) vectors, respectively. Recombinant vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). Protein expression was investigated by 1 mM IPTG induction. Hens were immunized by the purified recombinant FanC protein. The activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were detected by dot-blotting, Western blotting, and indirect ELISA. Results: We obtained FanC specific IgYs by immunizing the hens with the recombinant FanC protein. The anti-FanC IgY showed binding specifically to the FanC protein of ETEC.","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are the major cause of diarrhea (1) . ETEC expressing K99 fimbriae is a bacterium that causes diarrhea in calves, lambs, piglets (2) , and humans (3) resulting in mortality, morbidity, reduction of live weight, and huge economic losses (4) . The K99 protein located at the surface of ETEC is a polymeric protein structure and has a diameter of 5 nm (2) . K99 fragment encodes eight gene products named FanA to FanH, all of which are required for biosynthesis of K99 (5) . The nucleotide sequence of the FanC gene comprises 159 amino acids which are proceeded by the signal sequence of 22 residues (6) ."
Rhinovirus Associated Severe Respiratory Failure in Immunocompetent Adult Patient,"Rhinovirus infection is typically associated with the common cold and has rarely been reported as a cause of severe pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. A 55-year-old previous healthy woman, who consumed half a bottle of alcohol daily, presented with respiratory failure after one week of upper respiratory infection symptoms. Radiography revealed bilateral, diffuse ground glass opacity with patchy consolidation in the whole lung field; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis indicated that rhinovirus was the causative organism. After five days of conservative support, the symptoms and radiographic findings began to improve. We report this rare case of rhinovirus pneumonia in an otherwise healthy host along with a review of references.","Rhinovirus infection is typically associated with the common cold 1,2 and exacerbation of asthma symptoms 3 . Rhinovirus infection can extend to lower respiratory tract in children [4] [5] [6] or immunocompromised hosts 7, 8 , but is generally not concerned as singular cause of severe pneumonia, especially in immunocompetent adults. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have enhanced the detection of respiratory viral infection, PCR cannot help distinguish between with patchy consolidations in the whole lung field, but pleural effusion was not present (Figure 2 ). Laboratory tests revealed a white cell count of 20,930/mm 3 (differential count: 91.5% neutrophils, 6.4% lymphocytes, and 0% eosinophil), hemoglobin concentration 12.7 g/dL, platelet count 366,000/mm 3 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 84 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein level 43.1 mg/dL. Analysis of arterial blood gases indi-cated a PaO 2 of 33.5 mm Hg, PaCO 2 26.1 mm Hg, HCO 3 19.7 mmol/L, and SaO 2 71.1% without acidosis. The patient' s liver and renal function tests were within normal range. High-flow O 2 therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics with oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche, Utley, NJ, USA) were started empirically, and bronchoscopy was performed immediately. Total cell counts of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were 240 cells/mm 3 , www.e-trd.org including 75% neutrophils, 4% mononuclear cells, 1% eosinophil, and 20% macrophages. Cultures for common bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi were all negative. PCR for Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were also negative. However, PCR of BAL fluid indicated the presence of rhinovirus, which was not detected following PCR of the nasopharyngeal specimen. Mycoplasma antibody and urinary pneumococcal antigen test were negative. Serologic test for venereal disease research laboratory test, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B, C antibodies, and human immunodeficiency virus, as well as for autoantibodies such as anti-nuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Clinical symptoms and infiltration on chest X-ray began to improve after five days ( Figure  1B) , and the patient was discharged from hospital after three weeks."
The Utility of Preliminary Patient Evaluation in a Febrile Respiratory Infectious Disease Unit outside the Emergency Department,"A febrile respiratory infectious disease unit (FRIDU) with a negative pressure ventilation system was constructed outside the emergency department (ED) of the Samsung Medical Center in 2015, to screen for patients with contagious diseases requiring isolation. We evaluated the utility of the FRIDU during 1 year of operation. We analyzed 1,562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening between August 2015 and July 2016. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. Of the 1,562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1,170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1,258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of FRIDU screening for diagnosing contagious disease requiring isolation are 76% and 98%, respectively. No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units. However, the risks of deterioration during the screening process remain challenges.","Infectious diseases have historically affected the development and advancement of human societies. During the early-and mid-20th century, mortality associated with infectious diseases declined dramatically due to advances in medicine and public health; however, they remain a major public health burden worldwide. Recent data presented by the World Health Organization indicated that more than a quarter of the estimated 59 million deaths that occur globally each year are associated with infectious disease (1, 2) ."
Multiplex primer prediction software for divergent targets,"We describe a Multiplex Primer Prediction (MPP) algorithm to build multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify all members of large, diverse and unalignable sets of target sequences. The MPP algorithm is scalable to larger target sets than other available software, and it does not require a multiple sequence alignment. We applied it to questions in viral detection, and demonstrated that there are no universally conserved priming sequences among viruses and that it could require an unfeasibly large number of primers ($3700 18-mers or $2000 10-mers) to generate amplicons from all sequenced viruses. We then designed primer sets separately for each viral family, and for several diverse species such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of influenza A virus, Norwalk virus, and HIV-1. We empirically demonstrated the application of the software with a multiplex set of 16 short (10 nt) primers designed to amplify the Poxviridae family to produce a specific amplicon from vaccinia virus.","Researchers employ numerous approaches for viral detection and discovery, including metagenomic sequencing (1) (2) (3) , microarrays (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) or multiplex PCR followed by other methods of characterization such as mass spectrometry (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , suspension arrays (15, 16) or amplicon sequencing (17) . Multiplex PCR followed by analysis of amplified products fills a niche for viral identification when singleplex PCR has failed or there are a few dozen likely candidates but the expense of metagenomic sequencing or high-density microarrays is unwarranted (18) . However, multiplex primer design for many highly divergent targets is challenging since no universally conserved primers may exist, and finding sets of primers likely to function well in multiplex (e.g. isothermal T m 's, no primer dimers) adds to the complexity of finding conserved primer candidates. Primer design software that requires a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input can be problematic for diverse target sets, as MSAs can be difficult to construct, exhausting memory or available time before an alignment is completed. Even if an alignment does complete for divergent target sets such as all members of a family of RNA viruses or gene homologues across species, alignments may show little nucleotide sequence conservation, and multiple primers are required to amplify all targets. Considering the challenges of primer design for targets showing sequence variation, it is not surprising that many of the PCR-based assays in the literature are predicted to fail to detect desired targets when compared against available sequence data, and this problem is worst at higher taxonomic levels like family (19) ."

Invited Review Chemical and Biological Mechanisms of Pathogen Reduction Technologies,"Within the last decade new technologies have been developed and implemented which employ light, often in the presence of a photosensitizer, to inactivate pathogens that reside in human blood products for the purpose of transfusion. These pathogen reduction technologies attempt to find the proper balance between pathogen kill and cell quality. Each system utilizes various chemistries that not only impact which pathogens they can inactivate and how, but also how the treatments affect the plasma and cellular proteins and to what degree. This paper aims to present the various chemical mechanisms for pathogen reduction in transfusion medicine that are currently practiced or in development.","People have been utilizing light for medical therapies throughout history. As early as Greek civilization, people have attempted to harness light as a therapeutic agent (1) . Currently, treatments for hyperbilirubimia (2) , T-cell lymphoma (3) , and even graftversus-host disease (GvHD) (4, 5) involving extracorporeal photopheresis are well established. Within the last decade, new technologies have been developed and implemented which employ light, often in the presence of a photosensitizer, to inactivate pathogens that reside in human blood products for the purpose of transfusion. While blood donor screening and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for various pathogens have been implemented to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted diseases, there is still residual risk to blood safety. With regard to emerging pathogens in regions previously not endemic to such infections, such as the Dengue (6) virus and parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (7) , pathogen reduction is particularly valuable. Unknown or previously unidentified pathogens such as SARS (8) and West Nile Virus can also emerge into the blood supply with little advance warning (9) . Blood banks and health organizations must react quickly to these scenarios to identify the agent, form a strategy for prevention of contamina-tion of the blood supply, and develop new screening tests, if necessary. Second, while testing methodologies continue to become more sensitive, there will always be a period of time during which the pathogen is undetectable (a ""window period"") and testing procedures will be limited by test sensitivity. Furthermore, blood safety is also threatened by residual white blood cells that exist even after leukoreduction techniques are employed. In contrast, implementation of pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) enables blood providers to take a proactive approach to blood safety by inactivating pathogens that might exist in blood products and thereby prevent infection of the recipient."

Reply to ""Comments on Fouchier's calculation of risk and elapsed time for escape of a laboratory-acquired infection from his laboratory."" mBio 6(2):e00407-15.","I n a letter to the editor (1), Dr. Lynn C. Klotz challenges my conclusion (2) that laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) are expected to occur at an extremely low frequency in facilities such as those used at Erasmus MC for studies on airborne transmission of influenza viruses between ferrets and that these studies pose negligible risks to humans and the environment. Unfortunately, Dr. Klotz does not provide a scientific justification of how the numbers should be adjusted based on the biosafety measures that are in place in these facilities, which is the key challenge in this debate. Dr. Klotz suggests that incidents at the U.S. CDC laboratories and the long history of escape of LAI agents and other escapes from laboratories show that my estimates of the likelihood of LAIs occurring at the Erasmus MC facility are too low. However, it is unclear to me how the incidents at the U.S. CDC-which did not lead to LAIs-would affect my calculations. In addition, I have pointed out previously that historical data on LAIs do not take into account the specific pathogen types or the numerous biosafety measures that are in place to mitigate the risks in laboratories where transmission research is conducted (2) ."
Attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis-mediated RNAi targeted to conserved regions against foot-and-mouth disease virus in guinea pigs and swine,"In this study, specific sequences within three genes (3D, VP4 and 2B) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome were determined to be effective RNAi targets. These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10-to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID 50 of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 · 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.","Short interfering RNA (siRNA) are small, double-stranded RNA molecules that direct the degradation of complementary messenger RNA via a cellular process known as RNA interference. It is widely believed that RNA interference is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism within eukaryotes and that its functions include endogenous gene regulation, viral defense and the maintenance of genomic stability [14] . Because of the rapidity and specificity of RNAi, this technology could complement and improve the traditional tools available to control important animal pathogens."
The presence of the TAR RNA structure alters the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiency of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by modifying the rate of translation initiation,"HIV-1 uses a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift to synthesize the precursor of its enzymes, Gag-Pol. The frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication, is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mRNA, the frameshift stimulatory signal. The rate of cap-dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the TAR RNA structure, present at the 5' and 3' end of all HIV-1 mRNAs. Depending upon its concentration, TAR activates or inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). We investigated here whether changes in translation initiation caused by TAR affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. CD4+ T cells and 293T cells were transfected with a dual-luciferase construct where the firefly luciferase expression depends upon the HIV-1 frameshift. Translation initiation was altered by adding TAR in cis or trans of the reporter mRNA. We show that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by TAR and mediated by PKR. A model is presented where changes in the rate of initiation affect the probability of frameshifting by altering the distance between elongating ribosomes on the mRNA, which influences the frequency of encounter between these ribosomes and the frameshift stimulatory signal.","The precursor of HIV-1 structural proteins, Gag, and the precursor of the viral enzymes, Pol, are translated from the full-length viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Gag is produced by conventional translation whereas Pol requires a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift during the elongation step of translation, which generates the fusion protein Gag-Pol (1, reviewed in 2, 3) . Previous studies showed that a 2-to 20-fold increase in the Gag-Pol to Gag ratio prevents viral infectivity (4-7) and our group showed that a decrease in the frameshift efficiency as low as 30% severely impairs the replication of the virus in cultured cells (8) . The Gag-Pol to Gag ratio is therefore critical for viral infectivity and the programmed -1 frameshift that determines this ratio represents an interesting target for the development of novel antiretroviral agents against HIV-1."
,"Purpose: This study evaluated the specificity of different avian secondary antibodies used in Western blot and dot-blot ELISA to detect avian bornavirus antibodies in bird plasma. Methods: Plasma samples were collected from: two Blue and gold macaws, one positive and one negative for avian bornavirus by RT-PCR; a Cockatiel and a Monk parakeet prior to and following experimental infection; and, two Mallards, one positive and one negative for avian bornavirus by RT-PCR Samples were analyzed by Western blot and dot-blot ELISA that incorporated recombinant avian bornavirus nucleoprotein as the target analyte. Four species-specific anti-IgY secondary antibodies were used in the assays: goat anti-macaw IgY, goat anti-bird IgY, goat anti-duck IgY, and rabbit anti-chicken IgY. Results: In the Western blot, anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw and Cockatiel positive plasma, but no signal with Mallard positive plasma. Anti-bird IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Mallard positive plasma. Anti-duck and anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody produced a strong and moderate signal, respectively, only with Mallard positive plasma. In the dot-blot ELISA, there was a distinct and significant difference (P<0.05) in the signal intensity between the different secondary antibodies within a bird species. Anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced significantly (P<0.05) stronger signals than the other secondary antibodies in Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Monk parakeet positive plasma, while anti-duck IgY secondary antibody produced significantly (P<0.05) stronger signals than the other secondary antibodies in Mallard positive plasma. Conclusion: In testing psittacines with immunoassays, and especially in assays that incorporate short incubation reaction times such as a dot-blot ELISA, species-specific anti-IgY secondary antibodies provided more accurate results.","In 2008, avian bornavirus (ABV) was discovered to be the causative agent of Parrot bornavirus syndrome (PaBVs), formerly known as macaw wasting disease, proventricular dilatation disease or PDD, enteric ganglioneuritis and encephalitis, and avian ganglioneuritis. [1] [2] [3] Since then, multiple ABV genotypes have been recognized in over 80 different species such as psittaciformes, passeriformes, and waterfowls. 4 Diagnosis of PaBVs includes clinical signs and radiological changes, detection of viral antigen, viral RNA or ABV antibodies, gross pathology, and histopatholgy. [5] [6] [7] [8] Sampling for histopathology and tissue immunoassays, especially of nervous tissues, is not practical in living birds, thus these tests are more commonly used in post-mortem diagnosis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can utilize less invasive samples such as feather follicles, feces/urine, and cloacal swabs, 5, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] however sensitivity will vary due to intermittent viral shedding. [13] [14] [15] Immunologic testing comparing ABV specific antigens found that the viral nucleoprotein is immunodominant and hence the best antigen to use in a microtiter plate ELISA and in fluorescent antibody assays. 9, 16 A mixed anti-avian species IgY secondary antibody is often used in ABV serologic tests. 8, 9, [17] [18] [19] [20] The anti-bird secondary antibody, produced in goats using immunoglobulins from the White-crowned sparrow, Ringed turtle dove, domestic chicken, and Muscovy duck, a has been used in other ELISAs for the detection of arboviruses, flaviviruses, alpha-viruses, and poxviruses. [21] [22] [23] [24] The advantage of an anti-bird secondary antibody is the range of species that can be tested. This anti-bird secondary antibody has been used in serologic tests for the detection of antibodies in psittacine birds, even though the immunogen used to stimulate this secondary antibody did not contain antibodies from psittaciformes. Anti-passerine IgY secondary antibody produces better results than the anti-bird IgY secondary antibody or the anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody for serologic assays on passerine birds. 25 This suggests that species-specific secondary antibodies may provide more sensitive results in immunologic assays than commercially available mixed species anti-bird secondary antibody. In assays that employ short antigen-antibody incubation times, such as dot-blot or lateral flow ELISAs, a species-specific secondary antibody may be more useful when testing psittacine birds. Additionally due to the large variety of avian species susceptible to ABV infection, a low affinity of the secondary antibody could result in erroneous test results. The goal of this study was to evaluate the specificity of different avian secondary antibodies used in Western blot and dot-blot ELISA to detect ABV antibodies in the plasma of Blue and gold macaw (Ara ararauna), Cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), Monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), and Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)."
Original Article Clinical Microbiology Analytical and Clinical Validation of Six Commercial Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus RNA Detection Kits Based on Real-Time Reverse- Transcription PCR,"Background: During the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), six different commercial MERS-CoV RNA detection kits based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were available in Korea. We performed analytical and clinical validations of these kits. (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively.",", and UltraFast LabChip MERS-CoV Real-time PCR kits (Nanobiosys, Seoul, Korea) used one step to simultaneously detect both upE and ORF1a using two single gene-targeting reagents. None of these kits have been approved for diagnostic use; however, they were urgently introduced into clinical laboratories on June 4, 2015 because the timely diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections was essential during the nationwide MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea [1, 2] ."
"Deletions into an NH2-Terminal Hydrophobic Domain in Secretion of Rotavirus VP7, a Resident Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Glycoprotein Result","Rotavirus, a non-enveloped reovirus, buds into the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transiently acquires a membrane. The structural glycoprotein, VP7, a 38-kD integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably transfers to vi.rus in this process. The gene for VP7 potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids which has two tandem hydrophobic domains at the NH2-terminal, each preceded by an in-frame ATG codon.","the portions of the expressed products that are important in determining their plasma membrane localization. These membrane glycoproteins are characterized by a COOH-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchoring segment and a cytoplasmic tail. Disruption of the former has generally resulted in complete secretion of these molecules, which in their native state traverse most of the secretory pathway. Alterations of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail had diverse effects. Some mutant proteins became blocked along the secretory pathway and others failed to traverse the pathway at all. The exact nature of the signal for targeting these proteins to the plasma membrane was not clear from these studies. Failure of these molecules to move along the exocytosis pathway may have been due to the alteration of a positive plasma membrane targeting signal or to denaturation of the protein product."
,COMMENTARY,"Immune aging manifests itself at several levels, from the whole organism to individual cells. At the organismal level, an age-associated increase in susceptibility to infectious diseases is well established. Morbidity and mortality from numerous viral (influenza, Varicella-Zoster, herpes simplex virus-1, and poxviruses) and bacterial (pneumococci; Escherichia coli , Salmonella ) diseases, including some notable emerging pathogens (West Nile virus [WNV] and SARS-inducing coronavirus) is increased in elderly humans and old animals (for review see references 1-3). These pathogens use distinct ports of entry and induce distinct pathologies that affect numerous organ systems (such as the skin, respiratory, circulatory, urinary, central nervous system, etc.), suggesting a decline and dysregulation of many processes that normally lead to effective immunity (1, 2) . Although it is likely that functional and structural alterations in both the entry sites and the target organs used by these pathogens facilitate age-related susceptibility to some infections (for example, impaired barrier function), there is no doubt that the dysregulation of immunity also plays a central and critically important role in this process. Accordingly, responsiveness to vaccination in the elderly is also substantially diminished, and vaccineinduced protection is suboptimal."
Large-scale evolutionary surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus using resequencing arrays,"In April 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1 2009) virus emerged that rapidly spread around the world. While current variants of this virus have caused widespread disease, particularly in vulnerable","groups, there remains the possibility that future variants may cause increased virulence, drug resistance or vaccine escape. Early detection of these virus variants may offer the chance for increased containment and potentially prevention of the virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus genome and its variants, with added focus on critical regions such as drug-binding sites, structural components and mutation hotspots. The accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR) introduces novel methods that utilize neighbourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substitution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is highly accurate and has a much improved call rate. The high throughput and short turn-around time from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient largescale evolutionary biosurveillance tool."
Functional analysis of the SRV-1 RNA frameshifting pseudoknot,"Simian retrovirus type-1 uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting to control expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open-reading frames. The frameshifting signal consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream-located 12-base pair pseudoknot. The solution structure of this pseudoknot, previously solved by NMR [Michiels,P.J., Versleijen,A.A., Verlaan,P.W., Pleij,C.W., Hilbers,C.W. and Heus,H.A. (2001) Solution structure of the pseudoknot of SRV-1 RNA, involved in ribosomal frameshifting. J. Mol. Biol., 310, 1109-1123] has a classical H-type fold and forms an extended triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base-base and base-sugar contacts. A mutational analysis was performed to test the functional importance of the triple helix for À1 frameshifting in vitro. Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2-to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in À1 frameshifting.","Ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism that allows the synthesis of multiple proteins from a single mRNA. During this process a certain proportion of the ribosomes is forced to move one or two nucleotides backwards (-1 or À2 frameshift) or forwards (+1 or +2 frameshift) whereafter they continue translation in the new reading frame. As a result the stop codon of the first open-reading frame is bypassed and a fusion protein is synthesized [reviewed in (1, 2) ] Frameshifting is frequently used by RNA viruses, in particular by those with a single genome, and is thought to lead to precise ratios of viral proteins, which is crucial for successful infection (3, 4) . Frameshifting is occasionally used by the eukaryotic cell, e.g., to regulate expression of antizyme (5) or by the prokaryotic cell to regulate production of release factor RF2 (6) and synthesis of the gamma subunit of DNA polymerase (7) ."

Mouse LSECtin as a model for a human Ebola virus receptor,"The biochemical properties of mouse LSECtin, a glycanbinding receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family found on sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been investigated. The C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain of mouse LSECtin, expressed in bacteria, has been used in solid-phase binding assays, and a tetramerized form has been used to probe a glycan array. In spite of sequence differences near the glycan-binding sites, the mouse receptor closely mimics the properties of the human receptor, showing high affinity binding to glycans bearing terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man motifs. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to confirm that residues near the binding site that differ between the human and the mouse proteins do not affect this binding specificity. Mouse and human LSECtin have been shown to bind Ebola virus glycoprotein with equivalent affinities, and the GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide has been demonstrated to be an effective inhibitor of this interaction. These studies provide a basis for using mouse LSECtin, and knockout mice lacking this receptor, to model the biological properties of the human receptor.","LSECtin is one of a group of glycan-binding receptors encoded near the end of human chromosome 19 (Liu et al. 2004) . Other receptors in the cluster include the dendritic and endothelial cell receptors dendritic cell-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN related receptor (DC-SIGNR) (L-SIGN) and the structurally related Fc-binding receptor CD23 (Soilleux et al. 2000) . All of these receptors contain C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). Although a related cluster is found in the syntenic region of chromosome 8 in mouse, there are major differences in the organization of several of the genes, with eight mouse DC-SIGN-related genes replacing the two human genes (Powlesland et al. 2006 ). These differences make it difficult to identify clear mouse-human orthologs. In contrast, the human and mouse LSECtin genes appear to be much more closely related, although the two sequences differ at key residues that have been proposed to be involved in selective binding of ligands (Powlesland et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2009 )."
Bioengineering and semisynthesis of an optimized cyclophilin inhibitor for treatment of chronic viral infection NIH Public Access Author Manuscript,"Inhibition of host-encoded targets, such as the cyclophilins, provides an opportunity to generate potent, high barrier to resistance antivirals for the treatment of a broad range of viral diseases. However, many host-targeted agents are natural products which can be difficult to optimize using synthetic chemistry alone. We describe the orthogonal combination of bioengineering and semisynthetic chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a known cyclophilin inhibitor of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide origin in order to generate the drug candidate NVP018 (formerly BC556). NVP018 is a potent inhibitor of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 replication, shows minimal inhibition of major drug transporters and has a high barrier to generation of both HCV and HIV-1 resistance.","Treatment of chronic viral diseases by direct inhibition of viral targets frequently leads to rapid development of virally-encoded resistance. Therapies targeted to host proteins involved in the viral life-cycle offer an opportunity to both raise the barrier to generation of resistance and generate antivirals able to treat a broad range of viral diseases. However, this has been hindered in the past by the relative rarity of targets essential to the virus, but nonessential to the host, and the inherent complexity of discovering and developing drugs that effectively target these proteins."
"Analysis of the sex ratio of reported gonorrhoea incidence in Shenzhen, China","Objective: To assess the clinical process of gonorrhoea diagnosis and report in China, and to determine the difference of sex ratio between reported incidence based on reporting data and true diagnosis rate based on reference tests of gonorrhoea.","Gonorrhoea is a pyogenic infection of the urogenital system caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) that can cause epididymitis and prostatitis in men, and endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women, 1 and can ultimately lead to infertility in men and women. 2 Females are more susceptible to NG infection than males due to differences in the structure of the respective reproductive systems, and nearly half of the female infections are asymptomatic. 3 4 According to the WHO estimates in 2008, gonorrhoea is the most frequently sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the world, with approximately 106.1 million new cases diagnosed every year. 5 In 2012, China reported 95 263 new gonorrhoea cases, resulting in an reported incidence of 7.07/100 000. The gonorrhoea epidemic was especially prominent in Guangdong, which reported 18 014 new cases with a reported incidence of 17.15/ 100, 000. 6 Over the past several decades, newly reported cases of gonorrhoea within Guangdong province consistently ranked within the top five provinces in China. Shenzhen, a part of the Guangdong province located in south coastal China and adjacent to Hong Kong, has witnessed an alarmingly rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in recent years. 7 The reported gonorrhoea incidence in Shenzhen was 51.5/ Strengths and limitations of this study ▪ The reported gonorrhoea incidence is underestimated among both males and females, and this trend is significantly higher among females. ▪ The reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio has been overestimated by a factor of 7.9. ▪ Updated diagnostic criteria for gonorrhoea and a set-up active surveillance system in China are suggested to improve the accuracy of reported gonorrhoea incidence. ▪ False reference results and selection bias may exist, although we have tried our best to avoid them."
A Pathway for Targeting Soluble Misfolded Proteins to the Yeast Vacuole,"We have evaluated the fate of misfolded protein domains in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretory pathway by fusing mutant forms of the NH2-terminal domain of h repressor protein to the secreted protein invertase. The hybrid protein carrying the wild-type repressor domain is mostly secreted to the cell surface, whereas hybrid proteins with amino acid substitutions that cause the repressor domain to be thermodynamically unstable are retained intracellularly. Surprisingly, the retained hybrids are found in the vacuole, where the repressor moiety is degraded by vacuolar proteases. The following observations indicate that receptor-mediated recognition of the mutant repressor domain in the Golgi lumen targets these hybrid fusions to the vacuole. (a) The invertase-repressor fusions, like wild-type invertase, behave as soluble proteins in the ER lumen. (b) Targeting to the vacuole is saturable since overexpression of the hybrids carrying mutant repressor increases the fraction of fusion protein that appears at the cell surface. (c) Finally, deletion of the VPSIO gene, which encodes the transmembrane Golgi receptor responsible for targeting carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole, causes the mutant hybrids to be diverted to the cell surface. Together these findings suggest that yeast have a salvage pathway for degradation of nonnative luminal proteins by receptor-mediated transport to the vacuole.","Abstract.

Telephone interviews were conducted at 48 h and 4 weeks postvaccination.","In 2011, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (Tdap) be given to any person, including pregnant women, likely to be in contact with infants under the age of 12 months. 1 In September 2012, the UK recommended providing Tdap vaccine for pregnant women ideally between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. 2 Vaccine administration in pregnancy offers maternal protection against pertussis and also provides for maternal antibody to be passed to the infant, which has been demonstrated to be protective in their first months of life. 3 4 There are no theoretical safety concerns with administering subunit vaccines in pregnancy and some vaccines, in particular tetanus, have been used widely in pregnant women. 5 In October 2012, in response to a pertussis epidemic, the New Zealand (NZ) Ministry of Health began funding Tdap vaccine for all women from 28 to 38 weeks gestation."
WHAT MAKES HOSPITALIZATION SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT? AN APPLICATION OF THE DECOMPOSITION METHOD TO HONG KONG MORBIDITY DATA TITLE: WHAT MAKES HOSPITALIZATION SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT? AN APPLICATION OF THE DECOMPOSITION METHOD TO HONG KONG MORBIDITY DATA,Objective: To determine major factors and quantify its effect on the increase/decrease of hospitalization days using a decomposition method.,"Authority. [4] The public healthcare sector currently accounts for over 90% of total secondary and tertiary care, while its subsidy from the Government has reached 95%. The public only needs to pay HK$100 (US$13) per day to receive inpatient services, while the average operating cost is about HK$3,000 (US$350) a day. Healthcare expenditure has been increasing, accounting for 25% of Government expenditures. [5] With an ageing population of more than 13% aged 65 or over and an estimated increase to 28% by 2039, the whole sustainability of the public health system has been called into question and the Government has been actively trying to generate alternative resources to ensure the quality and survival of the public hospital system. 5 visit, is offsetting the corresponding increase in population size, patient population, and the number of visits per patient in a given year. In the present study, we use the decomposition method to examine the impact of the mean duration on the other two factors: total number of patients per 1,000 people of the general population, and the mean number of visits per year in assessing its impact on the total number of hospitalization days."
Cooperative translocation enhances the unwinding of duplex DNA by SARS coronavirus helicase nsP13,"SARS coronavirus encodes non-structural protein 13 (nsP13), a nucleic acid helicase/NTPase belonging to superfamily 1 helicase, which efficiently unwinds both partial-duplex RNA and DNA. In this study, unwinding of DNA substrates that had different duplex lengths and 5 0 -overhangs was examined under single-turnover reaction conditions in the presence of excess enzyme. The amount of DNA unwound decreased significantly as the length of the duplex increased, indicating a poor in vitro processivity. However, the quantity of duplex DNA unwound increased as the length of the singlestranded 5 0 -tail increased for the 50-bp duplex. This enhanced processivity was also observed for duplex DNA that had a longer single-stranded gap in between. These results demonstrate that nsP13 requires the presence of a long 5 0 -overhang to unwind longer DNA duplexes. In addition, enhanced DNA unwinding was observed for gapped DNA substrates that had a 5 0 -overhang, indicating that the translocated nsP13 molecules pile up and the preceding helicase facilitate DNA unwinding. Together with the propensity of oligomer formation of nsP13 molecules, we propose that the cooperative translocation by the functionally interacting oligomers of the helicase molecules loaded onto the 5 0 -overhang account for the observed enhanced processivity of DNA unwinding.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that claimed almost 800 deaths in southern China within a few months between 2002 and 2003 was caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SCV) (1). SARS continues to be a serious concern as long as there is no vaccine or effective drug. SCV is a single-stranded (ss) RNA positive-strand virus with a genome of 29 727 nt (2, 3) . A single 21.2-kb replicase gene at the 5 0 -end region of the SCV genome is translated into two large replicative polyproteins, pp1ab ($790 kDa) and pp1a ($490 kDa), which is generated with and without ribosomal frameshifting (À1), respectively (4, 5) . These two translational products are subsequently processed by the viral main protease termed M pro or 3CL pro , generating a number of non-structural proteins (nsPs). These nsPs include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsP12) and the NTPase/helicase (nsP13), which primarily constitute the membrane-bound viral replicase complex (6, 7) . The viral replicase synthesizes the entire viral genome (replication) as well as eight subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) (8, 9) ."
,"China has the world's second largest tuberculosis (TB) burden after India [1] . Healthcare workers (HCWs) in China's National TB Control Programme have a significantly increased level of exposure to TB disease and patients. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 2003, the Chinese government made increased efforts to protect HCWs from nosocomial TB infections and other respiratory infectious diseases, especially for those HCWs working in chest hospitals and infectious disease hospitals. These efforts (although not universal throughout China) included the increased use of biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories and respiratory isolation through negative pressure wards and rooms, and the practice of standardised biosafety protocols and procedures through continued training and education.","The goal of the present study was to investigate and describe latent TB infection (LTBI) among HCWs in China, and the effectiveness of infection control strategies in TB hospitals using the T-SPOT.TB assay and TST. This study was conducted in two major primary referral hospitals for TB patients and other respiratory infectious diseases in Shandong Province, China, in 2013: the Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital (SPCH), Jinan; and Linyi Municipal Chest Hospital (LMCH), Linyi. Approximately 3000 patients with active TB disease are treated in each hospital annually. Since 2004, both hospitals have been equipped with BSL3 laboratories that are used for mycobacterial specimen testing (acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear test, culture and species identification) and respiratory isolation wards with negative pressure rooms for smear-positive TB patients. As recommended by China's National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the TST was carried out by the Mantoux method using a 5 tuberculin unit dose of BCG purified protein derivative (Chengdu Institute of Biological Products, Chengdu, China). An induration of ⩾10 mm was defined as a positive TST. A blood sample for the T-SPOT.TB assay was drawn from each HCW before the TST was performed. T-SPOT.TB assays were carried out and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spot counts were analysed using an ELISPOT reader (CTL-ImmunoSpot S5 Core Analyzer; Cellular Technology Ltd, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). Covariates (age, sex, working year and job category) associated with positive T-SPOT.TB results were analysed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Univariate p-values were determined for each covariate by logistic regression. Covariates with univariate p-values <0.20 were included in multivariate logistic regression models. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of SPCH and LMCH."
Gene Expression Profile during Chondrogenesis in Human Bone Marrow derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells using a cDNA Microarray,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into multiple connective tissue lineages, which include cartilage, bone, and fat. Cartilage differentiation and chondrocyte maturation are required for normal skeletal development, but the intracellular pathways regulating this process remain largely unclear. This study was designed to identify novel genes that might help clarify the molecular mechanisms of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns. These findings provide novel information concerning genes involved in the chondrogenesis of human BM-MSCs.","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in a variety of tissues during human development, and in particular, are prevalent in adult bone marrow (1) . MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM) and expanded in vitro in their undifferentiated phenotype, retain an extensive capacity for multi-lineage differentiation into chondrocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and tenocytes under appropriate environmental cues (2) . The presence of specific, distinct antigens identified by the monoclonal antibodies SH2, SH3, and SH4, on the surfaces of marrow-derived MSCs, that are not present on osteocytes and osteoblasts, suggests that these epitopes are developmentally regulated. The antigen which bound to SH2 antibody was identified as endoglin (CD105), a receptor for TGF-β3, which potentially plays a role in mediating the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and in their interactions with hematopoietic cells (3) ."
Characterization of a Pathogenic Full-Length cDNA Clone and Transmission Model for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strain PC22A,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus. In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-⌬ORF3-RFP. icPEDV-⌬ORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-⌬ORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus-or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A. Together, these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting.","dustry in Asia (13, 14) . During this ongoing outbreak, new strategies are desperately needed to understand pathogenic mechanisms and the functions of viral genes and to provide new technologies to combat this disease."
Furin-mediated protein processing in infectious diseases and cancer,"Proteolytic cleavage regulates numerous processes in health and disease. One key player is the ubiquitously expressed serine protease furin, which cleaves a plethora of proteins at polybasic recognition motifs. Mammalian substrates of furin include cytokines, hormones, growth factors and receptors. Thus, it is not surprising that aberrant furin activity is associated with a variety of disorders including cancer. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of furin is exploited by numerous viral and bacterial pathogens, thereby enhancing their virulence and spread. In this review, we describe the physiological and pathophysiological substrates of furin and discuss how dysregulation of a simple proteolytic cleavage event may promote infectious diseases and cancer. One major focus is the role of furin in viral glycoprotein maturation and pathogenicity. We also outline cellular mechanisms regulating the expression and activation of furin and summarise current approaches that target this protease for therapeutic intervention.","The human genome encodes more than 550 proteases. These molecular scissors play important roles in essentially all physiological processes. They digest the proteins in our food, degrade misfolded or unwanted proteins and regulate the trafficking and activity of numerous cellular factors. Proteolytic cleavage is certainly one of the most important post-translational modifications, generating a plethora of bioactive proteins and peptides with key roles in cell proliferation, immunity and inflammation. Not surprisingly, mutations in proteases and/or aberrant protease activity are associated with numerous pathological processes including cancer, cardiovascular disorders and autoimmune diseases. 1 Intriguingly, also many viral pathogens exploit cellular proteases for the proteolytic processing and maturation of their own proteins. Similarly, activation of bacterial toxins frequently requires cleavage by proteases of the infected or intoxicated host."
Designing and building oncolytic viruses,"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are engineered and/or evolved to propagate selectively in cancerous tissues. They have a dual mechanism of action; direct killing of infected cancer cells crossprimes anticancer immunity to boost the killing of uninfected cancer cells. The goal of the field is to develop OVs that are easily manufactured, efficiently delivered to disseminated sites of cancer growth, undergo rapid intratumoral spread, selectively kill tumor cells, cause no collateral damage and pose no risk of transmission in the population. Here we discuss the many virus engineering strategies that are being pursued to optimize delivery, intratumoral spread and safety of OVs derived from different virus families. With continued progress, OVs have the potential to transform the paradigm of cancer care.","Oncolytic viruses (OVs), evolved and engineered for cancer specificity, are gaining momentum as a new drug class in the fight against cancer. Besides, causing the death of virus-infected cancer cells, the spreading intratumoral (IT) infection can also boost the anticancer immune response, leading to immune destruction of uninfected cancer cells. The paradigm of OVs has been reviewed extensively [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ."
A recombinant nucleocapsid protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies against porcine deltacoronavirus,"Recently, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has been proven to be associated with enteric disease in piglets. Diagnostic tools for serological surveys of PDCoV remain in the developmental stage when compared with those for other porcine coronaviruses. In our study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (rPDCoV-N-ELISA) was developed to detect antibodies against PDCoV using a histidine-tagged recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein as an antigen. The rPDCoV-N-ELISA did not cross-react with antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine group A rotavirus, classical swine fever virus, porcine circovirus-2, porcine pseudorabies virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed 100% sensitivity and 90.4% specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA based on samples of known status (n=62). Analyses of field samples (n=319) using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA indicated that 11.59% of samples were positive for antibodies against PDCoV. These data demonstrated that the rPDCoV-N-ELISA can be used for epidemiological investigations of PDCoV and that PDCoV had a low serum prevalence in pig population in Heilongjiang province, northeast China.","Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in a rectal swab collected in 2009 from a pig in Hong Kong, China, and it is related to avian and Asian leopard deltacoronaviruses that have been identified in apparently healthy wild animals [6, 22, 23] . Since first reported in swine in the U.S.A. in February 2014, PDCoV rapidly spread to other states in the U.S.A., as well as to Canada, and it caused significant economic losses in the swine industry [14, 16, [19] [20] [21] . Recently, PDCoV has been reported in the pig population from China and South Korea [5, 12] . Hu et al. reported the cell culture isolation, serial propagation, and biologic and genetic characterizations of cell-adapted PDCoV strains [9] . Jung et al. reported that two PDCoV strains, OH-FD22 and OH-FD100, are enteropathogenic in gnotobiotic pigs [10] . Chen et al. revealed the pathogenicity of a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate and characterized PDCoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets [3] . The accumulating reports demonstrated that PDCoV is associated with diarrhea in pigs."
"Crystal structure of RlmM, the 2 0 O-ribose methyltransferase for C2498 of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA","RlmM (YgdE) catalyzes the S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)-dependent 2 0 O methylation of C2498 in 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of Escherichia coli. Previous experiments have shown that RlmM is active on 23S rRNA from an RlmM knockout strain but not on mature 50S subunits from the same strain. Here, we demonstrate RlmM methyl transferase (MTase) activity on in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA and its domain V. We have solved crystal structures of E. coli RlmM at 1.9 Å resolution and of an RlmM-AdoMet complex at 2.6 Å resolution. RlmM consists of an N-terminal THUMP domain and a C-terminal catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domain in a novel arrangement. The catalytic domain of RlmM is closely related to YiiB, TlyA and fibrillarins, with the second K of the catalytic tetrad KDKE shifted by two residues at the C-terminal end of a beta strand compared with most 2 0 O MTases. The AdoMet-binding site is open and shallow, suggesting that RNA substrate binding may be required to form a conformation needed for catalysis. A continuous surface of conserved positive charge indicates that RlmM uses one side of the two domains and the inter-domain linker to recognize its RNA substrate.","Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) form complex tertiary structures that in mature ribosomes are stabilized by numerous ribosomal proteins. Large rRNAs in all species carry post-transcriptional modifications, the number of which range from 14 in mycoplasma to more than a hundred in humans. In Escherichia coli, there are in total 36 rRNA modifications: C-, O-or N-methylated nucleosides, pseudouridines, dihydrouridine and hydroxycytidine (reviewed in (1) (2) , 3) clustered in functionally important regions such as contact areas with mRNA and tRNAs, the catalytic peptidyl transferase center (PTC), the peptide exit tunnel and the intersubunit bridges."
Translational profiling of B cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus reveals 5 leader ribosome recruitment through upstream open reading frames,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome encodes several hundred transcripts. We have used ribosome profiling to characterize viral translation in infected cells and map new translation initiation sites. We show here that EBV transcripts are translated with highly variable efficiency, owing to variable transcription and translation rates, variable ribosome recruitment to the leader region and coverage by monosomes versus polysomes. Some transcripts were hardly translated, others mainly carried monosomes, showed ribosome accumulation in leader regions and most likely represent non-coding RNAs. A similar process was visible for a subset of lytic genes including the key transactivators BZLF1 and BRLF1 in cells infected with weakly replicating EBV strains. This suggests that ribosome trapping, particularly in the leader region, represents a new checkpoint for the repression of lytic replication. We could identify 25 upstream open reading frames (uORFs) located upstream of coding transcripts that displayed 5 leader ribosome trapping, six of which were located in the leader region shared by many latent transcripts. These uORFs repressed viral translation and are likely to play an important role in the regulation of EBV translation.","The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ␥ -herpesvirus that infects the majority of the human population and is associated with the development of ∼2% of tumors worldwide (1, 2) . The virus establishes lifelong latency in B lymphocytes that form the reservoir of the virus from which it can occasionally reactivate (3, 4) . EBV, like other herpesviruses, has a large DNA genome on which more than 70 proteins but also non-coding RNAs including miRNAs, a snoRNA and possibly long non-coding RNAs are encoded (2, (5) (6) (7) . The protein expression pattern of the virus appears to be tightly regulated. In infected B cells, some viral strains such as B95-8 nearly exclusively induce latency, characterized by the expression of the 8 EBV latent genes that belong to the EBNA and LMP gene families. This process results in unlimited cell proliferation and the establishment of continuously growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (2) . In EBV-infected tumors and in specialized B cell types such as germinal center B cells, the latent protein expression pattern can be restricted to a subset of these proteins or even completely vanish (2, 8) . In infected epithelial cells and in B cells infected with virus strains frequently found in nasopharyngeal carcinoma such as M81, the virus undergoes lytic replication, a process that leads to the production of virus progeny and requires the sequential expression of a large number of structural proteins that build the infectious particle, as well as viral enzymes that coordinate viral DNA replication and virus assembly (9, 10) . High throughput sequencing technologies have recently led to the identification of several hundred new transcripts, most of which are expressed in replicating cells (11) ."
"""Running the Gauntlet"": Formidable challenges in advancing neglected tropical diseases vaccines from development through licensure, and a ""Call to Action""","Translational science for new biotechnologies (e.g. drugs, vaccines, devices, or diagnostics) depend on the development of a robust 'business case'. This is driven by complex scientific, technical, logistical, financial and operational elements to determine the feasibility and probability of traversing the ""valleys of death"" leading to licensure. The potential results in terms of profitability and financial realization, called 'product value proposition' play a crucial role in establishing incentives for investment during and after development. With this review, our goal is to summarize the challenges in taking vaccines against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) from development through licensure and provide a perspective that these vaccines can have measurable public health and economic profitability and market success. Understanding these processes and its challenges would open the opportunity to accelerate and advance these essential NTD vaccines through the last mile towards licensure and for the delivery to afflicted populations in low-and middle-income countries.","The translation of basic biomedical research discoveries into robust pipelines of products yielding licensed, appropriate, usable, affordable, equitable and accessible tools, such as diagnostics, vaccines, drugs or devices, is essential to achieving universal and global health."
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as an Organ Phenotype of Vascular Microthrombotic Disease: Based on Hemostatic Theory and Endothelial Molecular Pathogenesis,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening noncardiogenic circulatory disorder of the lungs associated with critical illnesses such as sepsis, trauma, and immune and collagen vascular disease. Its mortality rate is marginally improved with the best supportive care. The demise occurs due to progressive pulmonary hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe inflammation. Complement activation is a part of immune response against pathogen or insult in which membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed and eliminates microbes. If complement regulatory protein such as endothelial CD59 is underexpressed, MAC may also cause pulmonary vascular injury to the innocent bystander endothelial cell of host and provokes endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and pulmonary vascular microthrombosis, leading to ARDS.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by severe pulmonary vascular dysfunction characterized by acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and systemic inflammation. Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanism causing pulmonary vascular dysfunction has not been determined yet, it is a circulatory dysfunction often associated with moderate thrombocytopenia [1] [2] [3] and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). [4] [5] [6] Because its pathogenetic mechanism is not clearly recognized, no effective therapeutic agent targeting the underlying pathologic disease has been procured to date. Ventilator support, fluid and electrolyte balances, and cardiopulmonary monitoring with the best supportive care have marginally improved the outcome of ARDS in several decades. Mortality rate is still very high. It increases with disease severity. In a multicenter, international, prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS, unadjusted hospital mortality was reported to be 35% among those with mild ARDS, 40% for those with moderate disease, and 46% for patients with severe ARDS. 7 Recently, two proposed hemostatic mechanisms have opened the door in the understanding of ARDS from molecular pathogenesis associated with endotheliopathy that promotes inflammation and coagulation disorder in sepsis and other critical illnesses [8] [9] [10] [11] ; one is ""two-activation theory of the endothelium"" in which endothelial pathogenesis activates inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic pathway and the other is a novel ""two-path unifying theory"" of hemostasis in which hemostasis initiates thrombogenesis and promotes microthrombogenesis, leading to vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD). 8, 10, 12, 13 These two theories are congruous each other since the endothelium contributes to initial hemostasis and triggers molecular mechanism for thrombogenesis. In endotheliopathy, the pathologic nature of inflammation promoting inflammatory response 12 is recognized and the character of ""microthrombi"" leading to multiple hematologic phenotypes is identified. 9 In addition, the true mechanism of in vivo hemostasis in vascular injury and three different thrombogenetic mechanisms within hemostasis are uncovered. 8, 10 Through the recognition of endothelial molecular pathogenesis, enough evidences have been accumulated that ARDS is one of the phenotypes of MODS occurring as a result of disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology contributing to endotheliopathy-associated VMTD (EA-VMTD). 1, [9] [10] [11] The objective of this article is to analyze the clinical, pathological, and hematopathological features of ARDS and to account for involved pathophysiological mechanisms associated with endothelial dysfunction based on two hemostatic theories. In the end, this author will look into potential therapeutic option for the treatment of ARDS according to ""theorybased medicine"" instead of ""evidence-based medicine"" since clinical trials for ARDS have completely failed to find an effective therapeutic regimen."
Beyond molecular tumor heterogeneity: protein synthesis takes control,"One of the daunting challenges facing modern medicine lies in the understanding and treatment of tumor heterogeneity. Most tumors show intra-tumor heterogeneity at both genomic and proteomic levels, with marked impacts on the responses of therapeutic targets. Therapeutic target-related gene expression pathways are affected by hypoxia and cellular stress. However, the finding that targets such as eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E (and its phosphorylated form, p-eIF4E) are generally homogenously expressed throughout tumors, regardless of the presence of hypoxia or other cellular stress conditions, opens the exciting possibility that malignancies could be treated with therapies that combine targeting of eIF4E phosphorylation with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy.","Owing to increased incidence, cancer is now the second most common cause of death in developed countries and the leading cause of death in individuals above 40 years of age [1] . The number of cancer-related deaths is expected to grow due to increases in life expectancy and lifestyle risk factors. Although current treatments have improved patient survival, the results remain dismal for advanced disease. For example, the 5-year survival rate is only 2% for stage IV lung cancer and 25% for breast cancer patients with metastatic disease [2] . In contrast, the 5-year survival of patients with in situ breast cancer exceeds 90%. Indeed, despite the development of a new arsenal of molecular targeted therapies over the last decade, patient survival with advanced cancer has improved by only 15% [1, 2] . One of the main reasons for these disappointing outcomes is the pervasive heterogeneous expression of drug targets within human tumors."
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Dovepress a 12-year follow-up study of combined treatment of post-severe acute respiratory syndrome patients with femoral head necrosis,"Objective: To investigate the long-term efficacy of a combination treatment of alendronate, extracorporeal shock and hyperbaric oxygen for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) of post-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. Patients and methods: The retrospective study was performed including a total of 37 post-SARS ONFH patients (66 hip joints) in the Department of Orthopedics of the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between November 2003 and November 2015, consisting of 6 males (11 hip joints) and 31 females (55 hip joints), with age between 19 and 47 years (average 29.9 years). Visual analog scale (VAS) score, Harris score and Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stage of imaging examination were compared among those before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 years after treatment. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis of VAS and Harris score before and after treatment. Difference of effective rate on all stages was analyzed with Chi-square test. Results: With 12-year follow-up, significant improvements on VAS (6.81 of pre-treatment vs 3.94 of 12-year post-treatment) and Harris score (74.54 of pre-treatment vs 80.14 of 12-year post-treatment) were observed (all p,0.05). Effective rate showed statistical significance among three stages of ARCO (p,0.05). The combined treatment showed different efficacies on different ARCO stages; the best was on ARCO Phase I. Conclusion: The combined treatment may delay or discontinue the development of ONFH in post-SARS patients.","Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a refractory disease in orthopedics practice and can be divided into traumatic and non-traumatic types. Major reasons causing non-traumatic ONFH include hormone abuse, ethanol overdosage, congenital and other unknown factors. In the spring of 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in most cities of China, and the patients who recovered from SARS suffered mostly from the refractory disease -ONFH. The incidence of ONFH is ∼60%-70% after SARS treatment, and ONFH mostly occurred in bilateral sides. 1 It is thought that post-SARS ONFH is mainly caused by the application of high dosage of glucocorticoid hormones during SARS treatment, though some studies indicated that other reasons might be applicable in those cases. 2,3 SARS could be one independent risk factor causing ONFH, 4, 5 perhaps via mediation by S proteins. 6 Due to unclear pathogenesis and mechanism of SARS, there has been no definitive treatment strategy for ONFH. Major treatment approaches include non-surgery (drugs, hyperbaric oxygen, extracorporeal shock wave, pulsed electromagnetic treatment, decreased loading, and proper breaking and retraction) and surgery (medullary decompression of femur, bone transplant without vessels, osteotomy, autograft bone transplantation with vessels, and artificial joint replacement). [8] [9] [10] Here, we retrospectively studied the long-term efficacies of the combined treatment (non-surgery) for 37 post-SARS patients suffering from ONFH between the end of 2003 and the end of 2015."
Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Infections in Older Adults With Moderate to Severe Influenza-like Illness,Background. Few studies have prospectively assessed viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections in communitybased elderly individuals. We assessed viral respiratory pathogens in individuals ≥65 years with influenza-like illness (ILI).,"Elderly individuals are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to microbial infections because of coexisting chronic disease and immune senescence [1] . The contribution of noninfluenza viral infections to acute respiratory illness in the elderly has not been well studied, partly due to difficulties in diagnosis due to atypical presentations and low viral loads [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, identification of respiratory viruses is now possible with the advent of sensitive molecular detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [6, 7] ."
Economic burden of pneumococcal infections in children under 5 years of age,"The present study aimed to determine the cost of childhood pneumococcal infections under 5 years of age and to provide further data for future health economy studies. Electronic medical records of children diagnosed with meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae and all-cause pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) between January 2013-April 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Direct costs for the treatments of hospitalized patients (pneumonia and pneumococcal meningitis) including costs of healthcare services consisted of costs of hospital bed, examination, laboratory analyses, scanning methods, consultation, vascular access procedures, and infusion and intravenous treatments. Direct costs for patients (AOM) treated in outpatient setting included constant price paid for the examination and cost of prescribed antibiotics. Indirect costs included cost of work loss of parents and their transportation expenses. Data of 130 children with pneumococcal meningitis (n D 10), pneumonia (n D 53), and AOM (n D 67) were analyzed. The total median cost was €4,060.38 (direct cost: €3,346.38 and indirect cost: €829.18) for meningitis, €835.91 (direct cost: €480.66 and indirect cost: €330.09) for pneumonia, and €117.32 (direct cost: €17.59 and indirect cost: €99.73) for AOM. The medication cost (p D 0.047), indirect cost (p D 0.032), and total cost (p D 0.011) were significantly higher in pneumonia patients aged 36 months than those aged <36 months; however, direct cost of AOM were significantly higher in the patients aged <36 months (p D 0.049). Results of the present study revealed that the treatment cost was significantly enhanced for hospitalization and for advanced disease. Thus, preventive actions, mainly vaccination, should be conducted regularly. KEYWORDS children; economic burden; pneumococcal infections; vaccine CONTACT Yasemin Ozsurekci","Pneumonia, meningitis, and acute otitis media (AOM) are substantial pediatric public health problems worldwide. 1 In this group of diseases, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the major global etiological cause of pneumonia and accounts for 36% of overall childhood pneumonia. 2 As invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infections decrease, pneumococcus has become the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children aged 5 years or below and is also isolated in 28%-55% of middle ear aspirates from AOM cases. 3 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, approximately 1.6 million people die of pneumococcal diseases each year 4 and 0.7-1 million of these deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years. 2 Although case fatality rate due to pneumococcal infections is substantially high in developing countries, it is also considerable in developed countries. While case fatality rate of pneumococcal meningitis was reported as 48% in hospitalized children in Gambia, 5 this rate has been reported as high as 20% in developed countries. 6 According to the results of a study evaluating the global disease burden of pneumonia in children under the age of 5 years, pneumococcal diseases accounted for approximately 11% of overall deaths. 1 Further analyses of the same study revealed that the mortality rate was 119 (87-130) per 100,000 and the case-fatality rate was 5% (4%-9%) for pneumococcal pneumonia; however, for pneumococcal meningitis, the case-fatality rate was as high as 59% (27%-80%) despite the mortality rate of 10 (4-13) per 100,000. Within the European region (including Turkey) identified by WHO, the mortality rate was 25 (18-28) per 100,000 and the case-fatality rate was 5% (4%-9%) for pneumococcal pneumonia, whereas these rates were 3 (2-4) per 100,000 and 38% (32%-58%), respectively, for pneumococcal meningitis. The differences in quality and accessibility of healthcare services may create differences between countries."
Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity uncovers the microevolution of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus | RESEARCH REPORT,"Genome sequence analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) variants from patient specimens has revealed the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the virus. However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non-consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deepsequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non-consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has been shown to cause severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Zaki et al. 2012) . As of March 1, 2016, 1638 laboratoryconfirmed cases (587 deaths; 36% case fatality rate [CFR] ) have been reported to the World Health Organization. A South Korean outbreak of MERS began in May 2015, and its transmission continued until early July, resulting in 186 laboratory-confirmed cases with 38 deaths (20.4% CFR). In contrast to previous studies, which have suggested limited person-to-person transmissibility of MERS-CoV (Breban et al. 2013; Cotten et al. 2013b ), many secondary and tertiary cases of transmission occurred during the South Korean outbreak. Importantly, more than half of the tertiary cases were transmitted from one particular super-spreader, called Patient 14 in this study. This unusual transmission pattern raised questions related to transmissibility as well as the potential adaptations of MERS-CoV to the human host. To address these questions, several researchers have investigated MERS-CoV sequences. However, all previous studies on the South Korean outbreak have focused only on the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs Kim et al. 2016a,b; Park et al. 2016; Seong et al. 2016) ."
"Drug Design, Development and Therapy Dovepress repurposing paclitaxel for the treatment of fibrosis: indication discovery for existing drugs Dear editor","In the recently published paper by Zhang et al 1 in Drug Des Develop Ther, the authors have evaluated the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the antifibrotic activity of paclitaxel in vitro and in mice. They have reported that the treatment of paclitaxel at 2-4 µM reduced the level of phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr705 in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and downregulated the expression of fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen I in cultured rat renal interstitial fibroblast NRK-49F cells derived from normal kidney. Treatment of the cells with the selective STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 at 50 mM suppressed the expression of fibronectin, α-SMA, and collagen I in NRK-49F cells. However, S3I-201 treatment increased the expression of phosphorylated STAT1 but did not affect that of phosphorylated STAT5M. The immunoprecipitation assay has revealed that paclitaxel inhibited the STAT3 activity by disrupting the binding of STAT3 with tubulin independently of the effect on STAT3 phosphorylation and by inhibiting STAT3 nucleus translocation. 1 Furthermore, paclitaxel treatment by intraperitoneal injection at 0.3 mg/kg twice a week ameliorated renal interstitial fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of fibronectin, α-SMA, and collagen I in a male C57 mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction. Paclitaxel administration also suppressed the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) by inhibition of STAT3 activity in mouse obstructive nephropathy. 1 These findings indicate that paclitaxel suppresses renal interstitial fibrosis via inhibition of STAT3-mediated pathway and production of proinflammatory cytokines. The findings from this study indicate that in addition to being a clinically used anticancer agent, paclitaxel may represent a new agent that manages renal fibrosis.","In the recently published paper by Zhang et al 1 in Drug Des Develop Ther, the authors have evaluated the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the antifibrotic activity of paclitaxel in vitro and in mice.

SURVEY AND SUMMARY RAN translation and frameshifting as translational challenges at simple repeats of human neurodegenerative disorders,"Repeat-associated disorders caused by expansions of short sequences have been classified as coding and noncoding and are thought to be caused by protein gain-of-function and RNA gain-of-function mechanisms, respectively. The boundary between such classifications has recently been blurred by the discovery of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation reported in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8, myotonic dystrophy type 1, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. This noncanonical translation requires no AUG start codon and can initiate in multiple frames of CAG, CGG and GGGGCC repeats of the sense and antisense strands of diseaserelevant transcripts. RNA structures formed by the repeats have been suggested as possible triggers; however, the precise mechanism of the translation initiation remains elusive. Templates containing expansions of microsatellites have also been shown to challenge translation elongation, as frameshifting has been recognized across CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington's disease. Determining the critical requirements for RAN translation and frameshifting is essential to decipher the mechanisms that govern these processes. The contribution of unusual translation products to pathogenesis needs to be better understood. In this review, we present current knowledge regarding RAN translation and frameshifting and discuss the pro-posed mechanisms of translational challenges imposed by simple repeat expansions.","A particular group of human neurological disorders is associated with expansions of simple repetitive elements within specific genes. This class comprises more than 20 diseases, which have been categorized into coding and noncoding repeat expansion disorders depending on the genetic location of their causative mutations (1) (2) (3) . The toxicity of the coding repeats located within ATG-initiated open reading frames (ORFs) is typically governed via a protein gainof-function mechanism. This mode of repeat toxicity is found in numerous disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), in which the expression of exonic CAG repeat expansions gives rise to polyglutamine (polyGln)-rich proteins that adversely affect various cellular functions (3) . However, the toxicity of coding CAG repeats can also be exerted on the transcript level via an RNA gain-of-function mechanism that was initially described for the noncoding repeat expansion disorder myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Also Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), SCA31, SCA10, SCA8 and, most recently, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS/FTD) have been shown to exhibit toxicity via a mutant transcript gain-of-function mechanism. In these diseases, the expression of transcripts harboring expansions of particular repeats leads to the formation of nuclear RNA foci that sequester specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in a loss of their normal function (9) (10) (11) ."
Neonatal infections in Saudi Arabia: Association with cytokine gene polymorphisms,"In recent years, many studies have reported potential associations between cytokine gene polymorphisms and the development, course, and outcome of sepsis, often with apparently conflicting results. The objective of this study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin (IL)-1β -31 T/C, IL-6 -174 G/C, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) -308 G/A, and interferon γ (IFN-γ) +874 A/T genes for their possible association with susceptibility to early onset sepsis (EOS) in Saudi newborn infants. A total of 205 newborn infants aged 1-2 days were consecutively enrolled onto the study having met the inclusion criteria (as per the research protocol). DNA was extracted from filter papers using the Chelex-100 method. The cytokines SNP were genotyping using Taqman 5' nuclease allelic discrimination. For cytokine measurements we used the commercially available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. Our results show that the circulating IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated in EOS patients compared to suspected and sepsis-free control groups; and IL-1β -31C, IL-6 -174G, TNF-α -308G, and IFN-γ +874A alleles were associated with EOS in Saudi infants. In conclusion, analysis of cytokines concentrations and SNP for the four tested genes can be used as a predictor of sepsis outcome in newborns.","Sepsis is a host condition of systemic inappropriate inflammatory response to the invasion of microorganisms [1] . Although there are many advances in the development of antibiotics and there has been an explosion of knowledge about the inflammatory response, sepsis still causes one million deaths each year (42% in the first week of life) [2] . Currently, it is accepted that inappropriate host inflammatory responses or inappropriate defence mechanisms play important roles in the development of sepsis [3] [4] [5] . Cytokines play vital roles in the regulation of host immune response, and altered expressions of cytokines are proven to be involved in the development of sepsis [6, 7] . Several risk factors for sepsis development have been identified [6] , but the cause of basic differences in susceptibility between individuals and populations remains unclear [8] . In recent years, several groups have provided accumulating evidence indicating that the genetic background of the host influences the susceptibility and prognosis of sepsis [9] [10] [11] . Previous studies have suggested that the variations in the genes encoding cytokines are involved in the modulation of inflammatory responses and are responsible for inter-individual differences in the susceptibility to sepsis [5] . Recent, epidemiological studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the genes encoding inflammatory cytokines may influence the course and outcome of sepsis [5, [12] [13] [14] . Exploration of host genetic markers with prognostic value for sepsis might be helpful in managing the neonates who would be most likely to benefit from aggressive antibiotic treatment, and they put the challenges involved into perspective [15] . Therefore, identification of newborns that are at high risk of developing sepsis could help us develop some effective prevention strategies."
Detection of kobuvirus RNA in Japanese domestic dogs,"To investigate whether kokuvirus is present in Japanese dogs, we examined the fecal samples obtained from 94 diarrheal household dogs and 50 clinically healthy kenneled dogs by RT-PCR. The gene was detected in 37.2% and 48.0% in the former and the latter, respectively, suggesting that canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) is circulating among Japanese dogs. From the result of the latter, however, CaKoV may not be a primary pathogen. Furthermore, all gene-positive dogs were purebreds aged four months or younger. This finding suggests that CaKoV endemic is confined in multi-dog environments, and the dogs have a strong age-dependent resistance to CaKoV.","An epidemic outbreak of gastroenteritis in humans, possibly caused by consumption of raw oysters, occurred in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, in 1989, after which a small round virus was isolated from the feces of affected patients. Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses, the causal virus was classified as a new genus (the genus kobuvirus) in the family Picornaviridae and named the Aichi virus [30, 31] . Kobuviruses are non-enveloped, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA viruses, and have been isolated from samples obtained from a variety of mammals. Genetically, it is classified into three strains, termed Aichivirus A (formerly Aichi virus), B (formerly bovine kobuvirus) and C (formerly porcine kobuvirus) [6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 29] ."
Network perturbation analysis of gene transcriptional profiles reveals protein targets and mechanism of action of drugs and influenza A viral infection,"Genome-wide transcriptional profiling provides a global view of cellular state and how this state changes under different treatments (e.g. drugs) or conditions (e.g. healthy and diseased). Here, we present ProTINA (Protein Target Inference by Network Analysis), a network perturbation analysis method for inferring protein targets of compounds from gene transcriptional profiles. ProTINA uses a dynamic model of the cell-type specific protein-gene transcriptional regulation to infer network perturbations from steady state and time-series differential gene expression profiles. A candidate protein target is scored based on the gene network's dysregulation, including enhancement and attenuation of transcriptional regulatory activity of the protein on its downstream genes, caused by drug treatments. For benchmark datasets from three drug treatment studies, ProTINA was able to provide highly accurate protein target predictions and to reveal the mechanism of action of compounds with high sensitivity and specificity. Further, an application of ProTINA to gene expression profiles of influenza A viral infection led to new insights of the early events in the infection. Figure 1. Protein target prediction by ProTINA. (A) The protein-gene network describes direct and indirect regulations of gene expression by transcription factors (TF) and their protein partners (P), respectively. A drug interaction with a protein is expected to cause differential expression of the downstream genes in the PGN. (B)","The identification of the molecular targets of pharmacologically relevant compounds is vital for understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of drugs, as well as for exploring off-target effects. While the definition of a target can be quite arbitrary, the term generally refers to a molecule whose interaction with the compound is connected to the compound's effects (1) . In this study, transcription factors (TFs) and their protein interaction partners represent the target molecules, while differential gene expression profiles represent the effects. Among existing technologies for protein target discovery (e.g. biochemical affinity purification, RNAi knockdown or gene knockout experiments) (2) , gene expression profiling has received much recent attention due to its relative ease of implementation as well as the availability of large-scale public databases and well-established experimental protocols and data analytical methods. A complication when using gene expression profiling for target discovery is that the data give only indirect indications of the drug's action. As illustrated in Figure 1A , the interaction between a compound and its protein target(s) is expected to result in the differential expression of downstream genes that are regulated by the protein target(s). But, the expression of the protein targets themselves may not--and often do not--change (3) . Consequently, target discovery using gene expression profiles requires computational methods to identify the (upstream) targets from the (downstream) effects."
ARTICLE 415 Multiple organ infection and the pathogenesis of SARS,"After Ͼ 8,000 infections and Ͼ 700 deaths worldwide, the pathogenesis of the new infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), remains poorly understood. We investigated 18 autopsies of patients who had suspected SARS; 8 cases were confirmed as SARS. We evaluated white blood cells from 22 confirmed SARS patients at various stages of the disease. T lymphocyte counts in 65 confirmed and 35 misdiagnosed SARS cases also were analyzed retrospectively. SARS viral particles and genomic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the mucosa of the intestine, the epithelium of the renal distal tubules, the neurons of the brain, and macrophages in different organs. SARS virus seemed to be capable of infecting multiple cell types in several organs; immune cells and pulmonary epithelium were identified as the main sites of injury. A comprehensive theory of pathogenesis is proposed for SARS with immune and lung damage as key features.","The target organ of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is widely believed to be the lungs, hence the names ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" and ""SARS atypical pneumonia"" (1, 2) . However, patients often have evidence of other organ dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms (3), abnormal liver function (4, 5) , splenic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy (6) . This may reflect widespread immunopathology or the presence of extrapulmonary SARS-coronavirus (CoV) dissemination and replication, as has been observed in other species infected with animal coronavirus (7) . Recent reports of multiple organ infection by the virus were based mostly on partial autopsies (8) . A comprehensive theory of pathogenesis for this newly emerged infectious disease is lacking."
Current Progress of Virus-mimicking Nanocarriers for Drug Delivery,"Nanomedicines often involve the use of nanocarriers as a delivery system for drugs or genes for maximizing the therapeutic effect and/or minimizing the adverse effect. From drug administration to therapeutic activity, nanocarriers must evade the host's immune system, specifically and efficiently target and enter the cell, and release their payload into the cell cytoplasm by endosomal escape. These processes constitute the early infection stage of viruses. Viruses are a powerful natural nanomaterial for the efficient delivery of genetic information by sophisticated mechanisms. Over the past two decades, many virus-inspired nanocarriers have been generated to permit successful drug and gene delivery. In this review, we summarize the early infection machineries of viruses, of which the part has so far been utilized for delivery systems. Furthermore, we describe basics and applications of the bio-nanocapsule, which is a hepatitis B virus-mimicking nanoparticle harboring nearly all activities involved in the early infection machineries (i.e., stealth activity, targeting activity, cell entry activity, endosomal escaping activity).","The drug delivery system (DDS) has been studied as a means of improving medication. Since the ""magic bullet"" concept was described about a hundred years ago by Paul Ehrlich [1] , scientists in medicine, pharmaceutical, and material science have been trying to discover or create sophisticated drugs that target specific molecules, cells, and tissues. DDS is one of the key technologies that can deliver drugs to target sites in the body. Numerous types of nanomaterials, including liposomes (LPs) and polymers, have been investigated as a DDS, some of which are now used in clinical settings [2] [3] [4] . These nanomaterials contain drug molecules by encapsulation, physical adsorption, or chemical linkage, and deliver them to the target. Nanoformulation of a drug can avoid renal excretion and allow prolonged circulation in the body [5] , which contributes to improved bioavailability. Moreover, nano-sized materials can passively accumulate at tumor tissues or at sites of inflammation site via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [6] . When the nanoformulation contains a targeting moiety, it can recognize specific target molecules in the body and accumulate at the specific site in the body [7] ."
Introduction of a point mutation into an HLA class I single-chain trimer induces enhancement of CTL priming and antitumor immunity * ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** *** *** * A single-chain HLA mutant enhances CTL priming M Matsui et al,"We previously discovered one particular HLA-A*02:01 mutant that enhanced peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition in vitro compared to wild-type HLA-A*02:01. This mutant contains a single amino acid substitution from histidine to leucine at position 74 (H74L) that is located in the peptide-binding groove. To investigate the effect of the H74L mutation on the in vivo CTL priming, we took advantage of the technology of the HLA class I single-chain trimer (SCT) in which three components involving a peptide, β2 microglobulin and the HLA class I heavy chain are joined together via flexible linkers. We generated recombinant adenovirus expressing SCT comprised influenza A matrix protein (FMP)-derived peptide, β2 microglobulin and the H74L heavy chain. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were immunized with the adenovirus, and the induction of peptide-specific CTLs and antitumor immunity was investigated. It was clearly shown that the H74L mutation enabled the HLA-A*02:01 SCT molecule to dramatically enhance both in vivo priming of FMP-specific CTLs and protection against a lethal challenge of tumor cells expressing FMP. These data present the first evidence that a simple point mutation in the HLA class I heavy chain of SCT is beneficial for improving CTL-based immunotherapy and prophylaxis to control tumors.","Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of a polymorphic heavy chain and an invariant β2-microglobulin (β2m), and play an essential role in the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immunity. They bind naturally processed antigenic peptides, and present them to CD8 + CTLs for immune surveillance. Since CTLs play a major role in the specific clearance of neoplastic cells and virusinfected cells, the improvement of MHC class I presentation and peptide-specific CTL induction is a key issue for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against tumors and intracellular pathogens."
Major advances in managing community-acquired pneumonia,"This article is a non-systematic review of selected recent publications in community-acquired pneumonia, including a comparison of various guidelines. Risk stratification of patients has recently been advanced by the addition of several useful biomarkers. The issue of single versus dual antibiotic treatment remains controversial and awaits a conclusive randomized controlled trial. However, in the meantime, there is a working consensus that more severe patients should receive dual therapy.","Aetiology worldwide Periodic studies of community-acquired pneumonia microbial aetiology are vital to confirm whether causal pathogen frequencies have, or have not, changed to guide empirical antibiotic therapy strategies. A prospective population-based study in Spain of both inpatients and outpatients found that Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.7%) was the most common agent, followed by Coxiella burnetii (18.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (15.9%), respiratory viruses (14.4%), Chlamydia species (10.6%) and Legionella pneumophila (4.4%) [4] . The microbiology of communityacquired pneumonia appears to be unchanged from that found in earlier studies. The high prevalence of C. burnetii has been reported in previous studies from Spain. Patients infected with conventional bacteria such as S. pneumoniae had a higher hospitalization rate, higher CURB65 (disease severity) scores at admission and more adverse clinical outcomes, such as severe sepsis, septic shock, ICU admission and longer length of stay compared to those with atypical and viral causes of pneumonia. Limitations in the study included an absence of sputum cultures and possible population bias."
Nucleosides for the treatment of respiratory RNA virus infections Introduction to respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses,"Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses are among the most common viruses causing mild seasonal colds. These RNA viruses can also cause lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In addition, swine and avian influenza viruses, together with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, represent significant pandemic threats to the general population. In this review, we describe the current medical need resulting from respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses, which justifies drug discovery efforts to identify new therapeutic agents. The RNA polymerase of respiratory viruses represents an attractive target for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs acting as inhibitors of RNA chain synthesis. Here, we present the molecular, biochemical, and structural fundamentals of the polymerase of the four major families of RNA respiratory viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae/Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We summarize past and current efforts to develop nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as antiviral agents against respiratory virus infections. This includes molecules with very broad antiviral spectrum such as ribavirin and T-705 (favipiravir), and others targeting more specifically one or a few virus families. Recent advances in our understanding of the structure(s) and function(s) of respiratory virus polymerases will likely support the discovery and development of novel nucleoside analogs.","Respiratory viral infections are a global health concern caused by dozens of different types of viruses. The respiratory diseases resulting from these viral infections represent one of the main causes of death in developing countries. 1 A more thorough understanding of respiratory viruses, their epidemiology, as well as medical impact on the communities they affect will delineate the path toward eventual treatments and future abatement of the illnesses. While symptoms of many respiratory viruses are similar, the viruses themselves are characteristically unique. Categorically, viruses are grouped based on similarities such as the nature of their nucleic acid genome, envelope presence, overall size, and even capsid uniformity. 2 This review focuses on the following families of RNA viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Coronaviridae. Orthomyxoviridae comprise negative (-) sense singlestranded (ss) RNA viruses that are segmented, enveloped, and includes the influenza viruses (see Table 1 ). Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae are also (-)ssRNA viruses, but are non-segmented and enveloped, and include parainfluenza virus (PIV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The Picornaviridae family, which contains positive (þ)ssRNA viruses are non-enveloped; the key members include the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Lastly, the Coronaviridae are (þ)ssRNA enveloped viruses, which include, chiefly, human coronavirus (HCoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV. 3 Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In a 10-year study, over 85% of acute respiratory viral infections in critically ill children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit were caused by either a picornavirus, RSV, PIV, or HMPV (see Figure 1 ). 4 Other DNA viruses such as adenovirus can be the source of respiratory infections but will not be discussed here."
Pathological and ultrastructural analysis of surgical lung biopsies in patients with swine-origin influenza type A/H1N1 and acute respiratory failure,"BACKGROUND: Cases of H1N1 and other pulmonary infections evolve to acute respiratory failure and death when co-infections or lung injury predominate over the immune response, thus requiring early diagnosis to improve treatment.","Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus with molecular features of North American and Eurasian swine, avian, and human influenza viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 25 April and 11 October 2009, 399,232 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza virus and 4,735 deaths occurred throughout the world. 5 Brazil reported 1,528 deaths up to 10 November 2009. 6 Swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection can cause severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in 15-30% of previously healthy young to middle-aged people. 3, 4, 7, 8 Death may occur when co-infections or lung injury prevail over the immune response, resulting in a progressive worsening of lung function (low compliance and oxygenation). Early diagnosis and a complete understanding of the pathological features of the H1N1 virus are important to help to improve treatment and the prognosis of this lethal disease. Analysis of the lung tissue from an open lung biopsy (OLB) of these severe cases can help in understanding the pathogenesis of this severe and sometimes fatal development. Until now, no reports of OLB findings used to guide the treatment of patients with H1N1 pneumonitis have been published, although according to many authors OLB is safe and diagnostically useful in patients with ARF, enabling appropriate therapy. [9] [10] [11] [12] The pathogenesis of ARF associated with swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) infection in humans is unknown. The influenza virus triggers pulmonary inflammation owing to an infiltration of inflammatory cells and an immune response. Bronchial epithelial cells are the primary target and the principal host for the virus. 13, 14 Normally, influenza viruses are recognized and destroyed by innate immune mechanisms which involve macrophages, interferon (IFN) a, b and other cytokines, natural killer (NK) cells and complement. When influenza viruses escape from these early defense mechanisms, they are captured and eliminated by adaptive immune mechanisms, where T and B cells and their antigen-specific effectors (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, cytokines such as IFNc and antibodies) target the virus. Additionally, antigen-specific memory cells (T and B cells) are involved in the prevention of the subsequent viral infection. 14 Thus, pathological findings obtained by an OLB, coupled to ultrastructural and immunologic analysis, may have an impact on decisions about changes in treatment strategies employed for these critically ill patients, and also provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of S-OIV infection. The objective of this study was to analyze pathologically and ultrastructurally S-OIV lung infection and the pulmonary immune response in a series of five cases with OLB."
A novel synthesis and detection method for cap-associated adenosine modifications in mouse mRNA,"A method is described for the detection of certain nucleotide modifications adjacent to the 5' 7-methyl guanosine cap of mRNAs from individual genes. The method quantitatively measures the relative abundance of 2'-O-methyl and N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, two of the most common modifications. In order to identify and quantitatify the amounts of N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, a novel method for the synthesis of modified adenosine phosphoramidites was developed. This method is a one step synthesis and the product can directly be used for the production of N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine containing RNA oligonucleotides. The nature of the cap-adjacent nucleotides were shown to be characteristic for mRNAs from individual genes transcribed in liver and testis.","I n most eukaryotes, polymerase II (Pol II) dependent transcripts are modified co-transcriptionally at their 5'end by the addition of a 7-methyl guanosine (m 7 G) cap to the first nucleoside of the nascent transcript. If no additional modifications are made to the cap-adjacent nucleotides, the structure is referred to as a cap0. In yeast and plants, only cap0 structures are found, however, in animals, modifications of the two nucleotides adjacent to the m 7 G are possible The methylation of the first nucleotide on the ribose residue ( Fig. 1a) will form a cap1 structure 1 . Cap1 messages can be converted to cap2 structures if a further 2'ribose methylation takes place on the next nucleotide following the cap1 (Fig. 1b) . These methylation steps are sequential and carried out by nuclear located methylases [1] [2] [3] . In a transcript where the first nucleotide is an adenosine in a cap1 structure, a further methylation of the 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (Am) at the N 6 position of the adenine can take place to give N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m 6 Am) (Fig. 1c) 4 . The methyltransferase that carries out this modification has been partially characterized and appears to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm 5 . Transcription start sites of focused promoters are usually contained within an initiator motif (Inr) of general sequence YYANWYY (Y5pyrimidine, N-any nucleotide, W5A or T) where the A is the principal start site and neighbouring nucleotides may be used to varying degrees 6 . Since, A is often the first nucleotide after the m 7 G cap, its modification may have a functional role. In order to study the effect of m 6 Am present in cap1 messages, the chemical synthesis of RNA oligonucleotide sequences that contain m 6 Am in well-defined positions, is necessary. A number of methods exist in the literature for the preparation of N 6 -methylated adenosine derivatives, with the Dimroth rearrangement being perhaps the most well known [7] [8] [9] . This transformation relies upon an initial N1-methylation of the adenine ring followed by an alkali-mediated rearrangement to give the N6-methylated adenine product. An alternative method for accessing N6-alkylated adenines has been developed, which involves the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of adenine derivitives, that are activated at the 6-position, with amine nucleophiles (i.e. MeNH 2 ) [10] [11] [12] [13] . In order to obtain the N6-methylated phosphoramidite reagents from these adenine derivatives, a number of additional synthetic steps are required, which results in a 6 to 8 step synthesis being needed to produce each phosphoramidite reagent [10] [11] [12] [13] . Such approaches are not realistic other than in synthetic chemistry laboratories."
The untapped cell biology of neglected tropical diseases,"The World Health Organization lists a constellation of 17 tropical diseases that afflict approximately one in six individuals on the planet and, until recently, few resources have been devoted to the treatment and eradication of those diseases. They are often referred to as the diseases of the ""bottom billion,"" because they are most prevalent among the poorest individuals in impoverished tropical nations. However, the few studies that have been performed reveal an extraordinary world of molecular and cellular adaptations that facilitate the pathogens' survival in hosts ranging from insects to humans. A compelling case can be made that even a modest investment toward understanding the basic molecular and cell biology of these neglected pathogens has a high probability of yielding exciting new cellular mechanisms and insights into novel ways of combating these diseases.","muscle tissue. From there, it begins its journey to the brain by invading axons of the peripheral nervous system, where it becomes encapsulated in a host-derived vesicle and marches toward the nerve cell body by specifically associating with the minus-end motor protein dynein (Raux et al., 2000; Klein, 2003) . Vesicle encapsulation enables it to cross synapses and eventual enter the CNS, where it ascends the spinal cord, homing directly in on the brain. Once in the brain, the virus undergoes massive replication, causing encephalitis, and spreads to the salivary glands and other organs. The rabies virus specifically accumulates in the midbrain, impairing serotonin transmission. This is the likely cause of the aggressive outbursts in infected animals that promote transmission of the virus (Klein, 2003) . Incredibly, the virus accomplishes this with a diminutive 12-kb genome containing only five genes (Ming et al., 2009) ."
Systems vaccinology and big data in the vaccine development chain,"Systems vaccinology has proven a fascinating development in the last decade. Where traditionally vaccine development has been dominated by trial and error, systems vaccinology is a tool that provides novel and comprehensive understanding if properly used. Data sets retrieved from systemsbased studies endorse rational design and effective development of safe and efficacious vaccines. In this review we first describe different omicstechniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology. In the second part, the application of systems vaccinology in the different stages of vaccine development is described. Overall, this review shows that systems vaccinology has become an important tool anywhere in the vaccine development chain.","There are many effective vaccines available to protect humans against infectious diseases. However, the development of vaccines against 'difficult' pathogens remains challenging. For example, vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still under development. Furthermore, some existing vaccines require improved efficacy, e.g. vaccines against Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium species causing malaria. In addition, new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease will continue to emerge, which require new vaccines to prevent epidemics. Also, therapeutic vaccines against noninfectious diseases, such as cancer, are needed. The lack of in-depth knowledge of the pathogen and requirements for protective immunity often hamper development. 1 Application of systems biology during the development of vaccines, or systems vaccinology, can be an important tool to enhance insight into immune responses induced by (candidate) vaccines or identification of (early) correlates of protection. 2,3 Alan Aderem defined systems biology as a 'comprehensive quantitative analysis of the manner in which all the components of a biological system interact functionally over time and space that is executed by an interdisciplinary team of investigators.' 4 This definition can readily be applied to study the responses to vaccination. Systems-based approaches are often labeled unbiased and broad (sometimes even the word 'holistic' is used). However, that is only true to a certain extent, as defining a research objective is already introducing bias. Often only a few analytical techniques are used (as described in the next section) to address the objectives (Fig. 1) . Usually, there are also limitations in availability of materials. For example, in preclinical studies using mice the amount of blood that can be collected is very limited, whereas in clinical studies mainly body fluids can be used, although biopsies and mucosal lavages are sometimes available. Also, time is an essential parameter of systems vaccinology for studying kinetics and cause-effect relations, but repeated sampling is limited in humans. In this review, we describe current developments of the techniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology and discuss the implementation of systems vaccinology in the vaccine research and development chain."

Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa as well as in the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic disease appears confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoVs from Africa have hitherto been poorly studied. We genetically and phenotypically characterized MERS-CoV from dromedaries sampled in Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Viruses from Africa (clade C) are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses from the Arabian Peninsula (clades A and B) but remain antigenically similar in microneutralization tests. Viruses from West (Nigeria, Burkina Faso) and North (Morocco) Africa form a subclade, C1, that shares clade-defining genetic signatures including deletions in the accessory gene ORF4b. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4transduced mice. A reverse genetics-derived recombinant MERS-CoV (EMC) lacking ORF4b elicited higher type I and III IFN responses than the isogenic EMC virus in Calu-3 cells. However, ORF4b deletions may not be the major determinant of the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Genetic and phenotypic differences in West African viruses may be relevant to zoonotic potential. There is an urgent need for studies of MERS-CoV at the animal-human interface."
Biosynthesis Ribophorins and Processing of in the Endoplasmic Reticulum,"Ribophorins are two transmembrane glycoproteins characteristic of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which are thought to be involved in the binding of ribosomes. Their biosynthesis was studied in vivo using lines of cultured rat hepatocytes (clone 9) and pituitary cells (GH 3.1) and in cell-free synthesis experiments. In vitro translation of mRNA extracted from free and bound polysomes of clone 9 cells demonstrated that ribophorins are made exclusively on bound polysomes. The primary translation products of ribophorin messengers obtained from cultured hepatocytes or from regenerating livers co-migrated with the respective mature proteins, but had slightly higher apparent molecular weights (2,000) than the unglycosylated forms immunoprecipitated from cells treated with tunicamycin. This indicates that ribophorins, in contrast to all other endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins previously studied, contain transient amino-terminal insertion signals which are removed co-translationally. Kinetic and pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine and [3H]mannose demonstrated that ribophorins are not subjected to electrophoretically detectable posttranslational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage or trimming and terminal glycosylation of oligosaccharide side chain(s). Direct analysis of the oligosaccharides of ribophorin I showed that they do not contain the terminal sugars characteristic of complex oligosaccharides and that they range in composition from MansGIcNAc to MansGIcNAc. These findings, as well as the observation that the mature proteins are sensitive to endoglycosidase H and insensitive to endoglycosidase D, are consistent with the notion that the biosynthetic pathway of the ribophorins does not require a stage of passage through the Golgi apparatus. preparation of this manuscript and to Ms. H.

"G&I Genomics & Informatics Small Non-coding Transfer RNA-Derived RNA Fragments (tRFs): Their Biogenesis, Function and Implication in Human Diseases","tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). A growing number of reports have shown that tRFs are not random degradation products but are functional ncRNAs made of specific tRNA cleavage. They play regulatory roles in several biological contexts such as cancer, innate immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the biogenesis and functions of tRFs.","It is now well known that mammalian genomes encode, in addition to protein-coding genes, RNA molecules that have no protein-coding capacity, and thus are referred to as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [1] . Recent high throughput sequencing data suggest that there are about four times as many ncRNA transcripts as there are protein-coding RNA transcripts in human cells. While some ncRNAs, such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and those well-studied ones including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are recognized as functional molecules, the majority of ncRNAs and their biological roles in mammals are underappreciated, as evolution would have favored against such gratuitous and wasteful transcription [2] . However, accumulating evidence has exhibited a remarkable degree of their involvement in many biological events including cell proliferation, cellular stress responses, host immune responses and virus replication [3] [4] [5] [6] . Based on their size, ncRNAs are classified into long, medium, and small ones. Those longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) are termed as long (or large) ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and include the majority of nuclear ncRNAs. Those ranging 40−200 nt are medium-sized ncRNAs including many classic ncRNAs such as 5S rRNA, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), etc. ncRNAs shorter than 40 nt are termed small ncRNAs (sncRNAs) that have been extensively studied in the last two decades and will be elaborated in the next section. In this review, we will focus on a recently discovered class of sncRNAs called tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs), as data from several groups including those from us suggested them to be emerging functional molecules."
,766 | E. Ahat et al.,"The Golgi apparatus is an essential cellular membrane organelle at the center of the secretory pathway (Klute et al., 2011) . Its basic structure is a stack of flat, closely arranged cisternae. Each mammalian cell contains ∼100 Golgi stacks, which often line up and laterally link to form a ribbon localized in the perinuclear region (Rambourg et al., 1987; Klumperman, 2011) . The primary function of the Golgi is to process membrane and secretory proteins. Cargo proteins synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transferred by COPII vesicles to the cis-Golgi (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013) . While traveling across the Golgi stack, they undergo posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolysis (Goldfischer, 1982) . In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), proteins are sorted for delivery to proper destinations, such as endosomes, lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or outside the cell by constitutive or regulated secretion (Marsh and Howell, 2002) . Proteins derived from one-third of the human genes travel through the secretory pathway (Pfeffer, 2013) , and proper functioning of the Golgi is required for a variety of cellular activities and homeostasis."
Type 1 interferon gene transfer enhances host defense against pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection via activating innate leukocytes,"Pneumococcal infections are the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Although the type 1 interferon-α (IFN-α) is a well-known antiviral cytokine, the role of IFN-α in antipneumococcal host defense and its therapeutic potential remain poorly understood. We have investigated these issues by using a murine transgene expression model. We found that in control animals, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection caused severe weight loss and excessive lung inflammation, associated with rapid bacterial outgrowth. In contrast, the animals that received a single dose of an adenoviral vector expressing IFN-α prior to pneumococcal infection demonstrated rapid and effective control of bacterial replication and lung inflammation and improved clinical outcome. Enhanced protection by IFN-α was due to increased activation of neutrophils and macrophages with increased release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and bacterial killing. Furthermore, we found that raised levels of IFN-α in the lung remained immune protective even when the gene transfer vector was given at a time postpneumococcal infection. Our study thus shows that the classically antiviral type 1 IFN can be exploited for enhancing immunity against pneumococcal infection via its activating effects on innate immune cells. Our findings hold implications for the therapeutic use of IFN-α gene transfer strategies to combat pneumococcal infections.","Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major human pathogen worldwide. Pneumococcal infection is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and can lead to invasive pneumococcal disease that includes bacteremia, septicemia, pneumonia, and meningitis. 1, 2 It is estimated that community-acquired pneumonia alone accounts for 1 million physician visits and 60,000 hospitalizations annually in Canada, costing about $100 million. 3 The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults remains high, whereas the highest incidence is in the elderly and in children less than 5 years of age, particularly in aboriginal children living in northern Canada. 1, 4 Worldwide, S. pneumoniae continues to be the most significant bacterial pathogen in children, causing ~25% of all preventable deaths in children less than 5 years of age and 1.6 million infant deaths per year in developing countries. 2, 5, 6 In addition, S. pneumoniae superinfection is the most common complication of influenza, which together form the leading cause of death from infectious diseases in Canada. 3, 7 Alarmingly, S. pneumoniae outbreaks have occurred across Canada and elsewhere in North America in the last 10 years. 8 Treatment is complicated by the continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae serotypes, the narrow serotype-specific protection provided by conjugate polysaccharide vaccines, and the ever-shifting bacterial serotypes away from the serotypes covered by the vaccine in invasive infections of vaccinated children. 2, 9, 10 Thus, there has been a pressing need for enhanced understanding of host defense mechanisms and development of novel therapeutic agents against pneumococcal diseases, particularly those caused by antibiotic resistant strains."
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct inflammation-induced microglia signatures,"Microglia are specialized parenchymal-resident phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS) that actively support, defend and modulate the neural environment. Dysfunctional microglial responses are thought to worsen CNS diseases; nevertheless, their impact during neuroinflammatory processes remains largely obscure. Here, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and multicolour flow cytometry, we comprehensively profile microglia in the brain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice. By excluding the contribution of other immune CNS-resident and peripheral cells, we show that microglia isolated from LPS-injected mice display a global downregulation of their homeostatic signature together with an upregulation of inflammatory genes. Notably, we identify distinct microglial activated profiles under inflammatory conditions, which greatly differ from neurodegenerative disease-associated profiles. These results provide insights into microglial heterogeneity and establish a resource for the identification of specific phenotypes in CNS disorders, such as neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.","The healthy brain hosts distinct and specialized populations of tissue-resident macrophages strategically placed in the parenchyma, perivascular spaces, meninges and choroid plexus where they coordinate homeostatic and immune surveillance functions [1] . As the only parenchymal-resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as critical effectors and regulators of changes in the CNS during development and adult homeostasis. Their ontogeny, together with the absence of turnover from the periphery and the exceptional environment of the CNS, makes microglia a unique immune cell population [2] . By sensing any disruption of CNS homeostasis, microglia rapidly change their gene expression programmes and functional profiles. Recent genome-wide transcriptional studies revealed a unique molecular signature selectively expressed in homeostatic microglia [3] [4] [5] [6] that is lost in disease and during ageing [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Microglia coordinate immune responses between the periphery and the CNS as they perceive and propagate inflammatory signals initiated outside the CNS [18] . A multitude of signals received from the CNS environment as well as from the periphery induce microglial responses towards phenotypes that ultimately may support or harm neuronal health [2, 19] . Although neuroinflammation and its associated immune responses are often linked to neurodegeneration, the inflammatory response per se provides a primary, transient and self-limiting defence mechanism, by which harmful stimuli are resolved and tissue damage is repaired [20] . Disruption of CNS homeostasis, neuronal deterioration and inflammation are common pathophysiological features of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, chronic inflammation is likely to be triggered by abnormal protein deposition, by signals elicited by injured neurons and synapses or by impaired pro-and anti-inflammatory regulatory mechanisms that ultimately exacerbate the neurodegenerative process [21] . Dysfunctional microglial responses are believed to worsen CNS diseases [22] ; nevertheless, their impact during the neuroinflammatory processes remains largely obscure."

It is such a large fortune for China to be able to prevent effectively from MERS, not only by actively monitoring the Korean imported case based on the notification of WHO Western Pacific Region Office (WPRO), but also by properly quarantining a number of close contacts. Otherwise, China might undergo the same situation as in South Korea, or even worse, if the patient kept on traveling through Southern China or went to health care facilities without wearing any personal preventing equipment.

Helicobacter pylori VacA Suppresses Lactobacillus acidophilus-Induced Interferon Beta Signaling in Macrophages via Alterations in the Endocytic Pathway,"Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis and avoids elimination by the immune system of the infected host. The commensal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus has been suggested to exert beneficial effects as a supplement during H. pylori eradication therapy. In the present study, we applied whole-genome microarray analysis to compare the immune responses induced in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or both bacteria in combination. While L. acidophilus induced a Th1-polarizing response characterized by high expression of interferon beta (IFN-␤) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), H. pylori strongly induced the innate cytokines IL-1␤ and IL-1␣. In BMDMs prestimulated with L.",actin polymerization and phagosome formation in addition to disrupting membrane trafficking in macrophages (5) .
Probable primary polydipsia in a domestic shorthair cat,"Case summary A 10-month-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat presented with a 4 month history of polyuria and polydipsia. After a thorough diagnostic work-up the only abnormal findings were hyposthenuria and an elevated random plasma osmolality level. Trial therapy with the oral and ophthalmic forms of desmopressin failed to concentrate urine. A modified water deprivation test confirmed the ability to concentrate urine above a urine specific gravity (USG) of 1.035. After transitioning the cat to a higher sodium diet and instituting several enrichment changes to the cat's environment, average water consumption and urine output levels decreased to almost normal levels and USG increased from 1.006 to 1.022. These findings provide strong evidence that primary polydipsia was the underlying etiology of the cat's condition. Relevance and novel information This case report exemplifies the challenges faced when a cat presents for polyuria and polydipsia without an obvious cause identified on routine diagnostics. To our knowledge, this is the first report of primary polydipsia in a cat.","Polyuria and polydipsia (PU/PD) are apparent in a cat if urine specific gravities (USGs) are consistently <1.035 and water consumption is >100 ml/kg/day. 1, 2 Once PU/PD is confirmed to exist, the diagnostic approach should include a thorough history, physical examination and minimum database, including a complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, thyroxine (T4) concentration, urinalysis (UA) and urine culture to rule out more common causes of PU/PD such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease, hepatic insufficiency, hyperthyroidism and pyometra. [1] [2] [3] [4] When a low USG remains the only abnormal finding, central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, as well as primary polydipsia, should be ruled out, as treatment varies with each condition. This case report summarizes a cat with persistent PU/PD and hyposthenuria that was ultimately diagnosed with primary polydipsia after completion of a modified water deprivation test."
Send Orders of Reprints at bspsaif@emirates.net.ae The Open Virology Journal,"Advances in clinical virology for detecting respiratory viruses have been focused on nucleic acids amplification techniques, which have converted in the reference method for the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections of viral aetiology. Improvements of current commercial molecular assays to reduce hands-on-time rely on two strategies, a stepwise automation (semi-automation) and the complete automation of the whole procedure. Contributions to the former strategy have been the use of automated nucleic acids extractors, multiplex PCR, real-time PCR and/or DNA arrays for detection of amplicons. Commercial fully-automated molecular systems are now available for the detection of respiratory viruses.

,"Purpose: This study represents the current epidemiological status of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) worldwide in the first three months of 2019. Patients and methods: Full details of the MERS-CoV cases available and published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website were retrieved. Related details of laboratoryconfirmed MERS-CoV were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods. Results: A total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall case fatality rate (CFR), 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was 14.8% [4/27]) were reported to WHO from the National International Health Regulation Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The overall mean age was 50±17 years and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3±3.3 days; from the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6±6.5 days; from the onset of symptom to death was 17.5±11.7 days; and the mean length of hospitalization for patients with MERS-CoV was 3.5±3.9 days. Males in comparison to females had a 1.5-fold increased chance (adjusted OR =1.5 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) of death related to MERS-CoV infection; 1.05 [95% CI: 1.1-3.3], 1.05 [95% CI: 1.2-2.8] and 1.06 [95% CI: 1.2-2.0] for those who had exposure to camels, camel milk consumption, and close contact with MERS-CoV cases, respectively. Health care workers had 2.4 fold [95% CI: 1.2-3.1] greater odds of death compared to other people. Conclusion:","Human coronaviruses (hCoV) usually causes mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses. 1 One of these hCoV is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) which is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV belongs to the genus ""Betacoronavirus"" that is an emerging zoonotic virus considered as one of the major public threats and causes severe and fatal respiratory illness in humans. 2, 3 This infection is different from any other known hCoVs that have the possibility of human and zoonotic transmissions. 4 The patterns of transmission and origins of MERS CoV remain unclear, and based on the analysis of different virus genomes, it is declared that it may have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past. Although an animal reservoir is suspected, none has been discovered. Meanwhile, global concern rests on the ability of MERS-CoV to cause major illness in close contacts of patients. 5 The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from subclinical infections to severe respiratory diseases and death. 6 MERS-CoV first isolated in September 2012 from a patient with fatal pneumonia in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 7 Since then, 27 countries in the worldwide have reported cases of MERS including the United Kingdom, United States, Austria, Algeria, China, France, Greece, Italy, Kuwait, Thailand, Lebanon, Egypt, the Netherlands, Germany, Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Jordan, SouthKorea, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Bahrain. 5 Globally, from September 2012 until 24 April 2019, WHO has been notified of 2374 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 823 associated deaths from 27 countries worldwide. 8 As per the author's knowledge, since the onset of MERS-CoV outbreak, several studies have been conducted on various aspects of this disease, including genome combinations, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. However, there are still gaps in the knowledge of this disease, and monitoring and periodical assessment of this emerging infection in an epidemiological study format seem to be necessary. After 8 years from the onset of the MERS-CoVoutbreak, this infection is still considered as a public health threat with no vaccine or specific treatment and also with some unknown epidemiological aspects related to it. Strategies to contain the MERS-CoV depends on providing epidemiological knowledge about this infection. This study represents the current epidemiological status (mortality risk, identify potential risk factor, and geographical distribution) of the MERS-CoV in the world in 2019 and identified and highlighted the most probable risk factors related to this infection."
Brief Communication Clinical Microbiology Evaluation of Allplex Respiratory Panel 1/2/3 Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assays for the Detection of Respiratory Viruses with Influenza A Virus subtyping,"The Allplex Respiratory Panel 1/2/3 (All16) is a multiplex PCR assay for detecting 16 respiratory viruses with influenza A virus (FluA) subtyping, and the first clinical assay based on multiple detection temperatures. We compared the results between All16 and Anyplex II RV16 (Any16) in 426 clinical samples. Samples showing discrepancies between the two tests were further tested using monoplex PCR. FluA subtyping based on the hemagglutinin type results of All16, which yielded H1, H3, and non-H1/H3, was compared with the results of the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel. The positive and negative percent agreements and kappa value for each virus between All16 and Any16 ranged from 54.5-100.0%, 84.7-100.0%, and 0.57-1.00, respectively. FluA subtype results from All16 for 26 samples were consistent with those from FilmArray. Good agreement was observed between the two methods, except when analyzing human enterovirus (kappa value 0.70), and the All16 showed reliable FluA subtyping results. For parainfluenza virus 3, the All16 was more sensitive than Any16. When testing 28 samples simultaneously, the mean test time and hands-on time were 4.3 and 0.5 hours, respectively in All16. In conclusion, All16 showed reliable performance, but further studies are needed regarding human enterovirus analysis.

However, the goldstandard methods for detecting viral infections, non-molecular methods, have critical limitations such as the requirement of labor-intensive and complex procedures and time-consuming steps [1, 2] . Therefore, in many instances, cell culture is no longer considered the gold-standard method, and molecular assays have become the standard of care for diagnosis [1, 3] . Multiplex real-time PCR is useful for diagnosing respiratory viral infections because the process time is faster than that of viral culture, it detects multiple pathogenic viruses simultaneously, and it is reli-able [3] ."
"Emerging Microbes and Infections (2012) 1, e23","The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in late 2002 and swiftly spread across 5 continents with a mortality rate of around 10%. Although the epidemic was eventually controlled through the implementation of strict quarantine measures, there continues a need to investigate the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and develop interventions should it re-emerge. Numerous studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies against the virus can be found in patients infected with SARS-CoV within days upon the onset of illness and lasting up to several months. In contrast, there is little data on the kinetics of T cell responses during SARS-CoV infection and little is known about their role in the recovery process. However, recent studies in mice suggest the importance of T cells in viral clearance during SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, a growing number of studies have investigated the memory T cell responses in recovered SARS patients. This review covers the available literature on the emerging importance of T cell responses in SARS-CoV infection, particularly on the mapping of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, longevity, polyfunctionality and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association as well as their potential implications on treatment and vaccine development.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged in Guangdong, China in late 2002 1 and infected more than 8000 people in 29 countries across 5 continents. 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the fatality rate of the SARS outbreak was estimated to be 9.6%. Of those infected, healthcare workers and caretakers accounted for the majority. The SARS epidemic was officially controlled by July 2003 after the implementation of strict isolation of patients. Sometime into the epidemic, a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent. [3] [4] [5] Molecular epidemiology showed that at least two strains of SARS-CoV infected the patients in Hong Kong, 6 suggesting that the virus had jumped from animal sources to humans on two separate occasions. Later in 2005, reports from two laboratories identified a virus resident in Chinese horseshoe bats that is genetically similar to the human SARS-CoV, pinpointing the horseshoe bat to be a likely natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV. 7, 8 If this is indeed the case, a reemergence of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out."
The prophylactic effect of different levels of positive end- expiratory pressure on the incidence rate of atelectasis after cardiac surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial,The use of positive end-expiratory pressure is one of the ways to treat atelectasis after cardiac surgery. It is not as a preventive method for the atelectasis. It's also a controversy about its beneficial level.,"Pulmonary complication is one of the most important and serious early problems after heart surgery (1, 2), which is a major cause of prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs and mortality (3) . Some of the pulmonary complications after heart surgery include ate-lectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome (4, 5) ."
MINIATURIZATION FOR POINT-OF-CARE ANALYSIS: PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY FOR ALMOST EVERY BIOMEDICAL ASSAY,"Platform technologies for the changing need of diagnostics are one of the main challenges in medical device technology. From one point-of-view the demand for new and more versatile diagnostic is increasing due to a deeper knowledge of biomarkers and their combination with diseases. From another point-of-view a decentralization of diagnostics will occur since decisions can be made faster resulting in higher success of therapy. Hence, new types of technologies have to be established which enables a multiparameter analysis at the point-of-care. Within this review-like article a system called Fraunhofer ivD-platform is introduced. It consists of a credit-card sized cartridge with integrated reagents, sensors and pumps and a read-out/processing unit. Within the cartridge the assay runs fully automated within 15-20 minutes. Due to the open design of the platform different analyses such as antibody, serological or DNA-assays can be performed. Specific examples of these three different assay types are given to show the broad applicability of the system.","Different trends in modern medicine give rise to a changing understanding of how treatment of diseases can work. One of the catch phrases involved in this change is ""personalized medicine"" (1) . In this context, findings by the human genome or proteome project help to understand how diseases originate and how the interaction of pharmaceuticals with the human body in general -specifically the interaction of pharmaceuticals for example with receptors of cancer cells -works (2) . From this point of view also diagnostic is changing. Whereas in the last decades diagnostic was mainly used for diagnosing already diseased people, diagnostic changes from this acute to a more predictive and pre-symptomatic analysis. Moreover, defining personalized medicine strictly; diagnostic is also used for the verification of treatment and in a later stage for its control. In this regard, also the complexity of diagnostic will change since more biomarker and analytical targets are known. Just by using a multiply of different markers a defined diagnostics and a subsequent therapeutic action can be performed (3) . Hence, diagnostic is changing dramatically because it has to (i) be more versatile since more parameters have to be determined, (ii) be more frequently available, e.g. for a near-term therapy control (iii) move back to the patient and (iv) be miniaturized for ""patient-friendly"" use. Whereas personalized medicine is more or less a trend in developed countries, these demands can also be derived for developing countries. Here, from a global world health perspective the impact of diagnostic is increasing also to implement a better and more targeted medication which will enhance therapeutic success (4) . Derived from these demands for developed and developing countries, there is a need for new diagnostic technologies. In this regard, there have been a huge number of concepts named for example lab-on-a-chip or lab-in-a-pocket and many groups are still working on new principles. Notwithstanding the increasing demand of these systems, there are just a few already commercialized. By analyzing the factors the different demands two different aspects could be found. Firstly, most lab-on-achip system still needs a huge and elaborated variety of secondary instruments (such as pumps). Secondly, serial production is in most cases not easy to achieve. Within a joint-project of seven Fraunhofer institutes called Fraunhofer ivD-platform a lab-on-chip system was developed which opens up the possibility to transfer almost every wanted biomedical assay, which offers a high degree of integration and which is able to be produced by means of a serial and automated production."
"Advancements in DNA vaccine vectors, non-mechanical delivery methods, and molecular adjuvants to increase immunogenicity","A major advantage of DNA vaccination is the ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.","The constant emergence, and re-emergence, of known and novel pathogens challenges researchers to develop new vaccination technologies that allow for the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines. Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) vaccines have characteristics that meet these challenges, including ease of production, scalability, consistency between lots, storage, and safety. DNA vaccine technology usually is based on bacterial plasmids that encode the polypeptide sequence of candidate antigens. The encoded antigen is expressed under a strong eukaryotic promoter, yielding high levels of transgene expression. 1 Inclusion of transcriptional enhancers, such as Intron A, enhance the rate of polyadenylation and nuclear transport of messenger RNA (mRNA). 2 The vaccine plasmids are generally produced in bacterial culture, purified, and then used to inoculate the host."
ELM-the database of eukaryotic linear motifs,"Linear motifs are short, evolutionarily plastic components of regulatory proteins and provide low-affinity interaction interfaces. These compact modules play central roles in mediating every aspect of the regulatory functionality of the cell. They are particularly prominent in mediating cell signaling, controlling protein turnover and directing protein localization. Given their importance, our understanding of motifs is surprisingly limited, largely as a result of the difficulty of discovery, both experimentally and computationally. The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource at http:// elm.eu.org provides the biological community with a comprehensive database of known experimentally validated motifs, and an exploratory tool to discover putative linear motifs in user-submitted protein sequences. The current update of the ELM database comprises 1800 annotated motif instances representing 170 distinct functional classes, including approximately 500 novel instances and 24 novel classes. Several older motif class entries have been also revisited, improving annotation and adding novel instances. Furthermore, addition of full-text search capabilities, an enhanced interface and simplified batch download has improved the overall accessibility of the ELM data. The motif discovery portion of the ELM resource has added conservation, and structural attributes have been incorporated to aid users to discriminate biologically relevant motifs from stochastically occurring non-functional instances. Figure 5 . Schema of the ELM resource and data life cycle. Annotated ELM classes, and instances thereof, can be searched by database query. Via sequence search by the motif detection pipeline, annotated ELM classes yield putative instances in query sequences. By adding experimental evidence and references, these putative instances become candidate instances for annotation, and, with further curation, ultimately become fully annotated instances.","Short linear motifs (SLiMs, LMs or MiniMotifs) are regulatory protein modules characterized by their compact interaction interfaces (the affinity and specificity determining residues are usually encoded between 3 and 11 contiguous amino acids (1)) and their enrichment in natively unstructured, or disordered, regions of proteins (2) . As a result of limited intermolecular contacts with their interaction partners, SLiMs bind with relatively *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Due to the limited number of mutations necessary for the genesis of a novel motif, SLiMs are amenable to convergent evolution, functioning as a driver of network evolution by adding novel interaction interfaces, and thereby new functionality, to proteins. This evolutionary plasticity facilitates the rapid proliferation within a proteome, and as a result, motif use is ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes."
mRNA pseudoknot structures can act as ribosomal roadblocks,"Several viruses utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting mediated by mRNA pseudoknots in combination with a slippery sequence to produce a well defined stochiometric ratio of the upstream encoded to the downstream-encoded protein. A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknotlike structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.","The reading frame of the vast majority of mRNAs is determined by the start codon after which the downstream cistron is translated in the same frame. Maintenance of the reading frame occurs without further signals to the ribosome. However, examples of genes containing information for programmed frameshifts can be found in most organisms, or in some of their IS sequences, transposable elements, retroelement-derived sequences or viruses. The sequence-information needed for programmed ribosomal frameshift varies and both +1 and À1 frameshifts can be induced (1) (2) (3) ."
A New Measure for Assessing the Public Health Response to a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak Corresponding author: Sung-il,"Contact monitoring is an essential component of the public health response to a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak, and is required for an effective quarantine to contain the epidemic. The timeliness of a quarantine is associated with its effectiveness. This paper provides a conceptual framework to describe the process of contact monitoring, and proposes a new measure called the ""timely quarantined proportion"" as a tool to assess the adequacy of a public health response.","The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea this year resulted in 186 confirmed patients, with 38 deaths (20.4%) and a loss of 0.3% in the gross domestic product [1, 2] . The first case of MERS-CoV was confirmed on May 20, 2015 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Despite efforts by the KCDC to contain the epidemic, not all of the 28 first-generation cases infected by the index case were identified in the early phase of the outbreak, and thus were followed by the occurrence of 125 second-generation cases, and 32 third-generation cases [3] ."
Open Forum Infectious Diseases Stewardship and Infection Prevention Education Made to Order • OFID • 1 Open Forum Infectious Diseases ® Developing Interactive Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Prevention Curricula for Diverse Learners: A Tailored Approach,"To impart principles of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC), we developed a curriculum tailored to the diverse aptitudes of learners at our medical center.","In 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) noted that traditional infectious diseases (ID) curricula were failing to stimulate active participation, recognize medical students as individual learners, or spark enthusiasm for ID [1] . In 2011, Abbo et al [2] surveyed faculty and residents at 2 teaching hospitals to assess knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about antimicrobial use and resistance. The majority of respondents desired further education on antibiotics and agreed that better use of antibiotics would reduce resistance, but they did not feel responsible for antibiotic over prescribing. In a 2013 follow-up multicenter survey of fourth year medical students, 90% desired further education on antimicrobial prescribing, but only 40% were familiar with the role of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) in promoting judicious antimicrobial use and preventing multidrug resistance [3, 4] . Authors also noted that only 15% of students surveyed completed a clinical ID rotation, an underused opportunity to augment ID knowledge and explore a potential career path [3] ."
Update on Canine and Feline Blood Donor Screening for Blood-Borne Pathogens,"Consensus Statements of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) provide the veterinary community with up-to-date information on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of clinically important animal diseases. The ACVIM Board of Regents oversees selection of relevant topics, identification of panel members with the expertise to draft the statements, and other aspects of assuring the integrity of the process. The statements are derived from evidence-based medicine whenever possible and the panel offers interpretive comments when such evidence is inadequate or contradictory. A draft is prepared by the panel, followed by solicitation of input by the ACVIM membership which may be incorporated into the statement. It is then submitted to the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, where it is edited before publication. The authors are solely responsible for the content of the statements.","A blood or blood component transfusion generally is a life-saving measure, but absolute safety can never be guaranteed. In addition to immune-mediated reactions caused by infusion of allogeneic cells or proteins, blood-borne pathogens can be transmitted by transfusion, potentially causing disease in the transfused recipient. In an effort to minimize pathogen transmission, all blood donors should be appropriately screened for infectious agents."
Biocontainment in Gain-of-Function Infectious Disease Research,"The discussion of H5N1 influenza virus gain-of-function research has focused chiefly on its risk-to-benefit ratio. Another key component of risk is the level of containment employed. Work is more expensive and less efficient when pursued at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) than at BSL-3 or at BSL-3 as modified for work with agricultural pathogens (BSL-3-Ag). However, here too a risk-to-benefit ratio analysis is applicable. BSL-4 procedures mandate daily inspection of facilities and equipment, monitoring of personnel for signs and symptoms of disease, and logs of dates and times that personnel, equipment, supplies, and samples enter and exit containment. These measures are not required at BSL-3 or BSL-3-Ag. Given the implications of inadvertent or deliberate release of high-threat pathogens with pandemic potential, it is imperative that the World Health Organization establish strict criteria for biocontainment that can be fairly applied in the developing world, as well as in more economically developed countries.","I n the movie Contagion, Laurence Fishburne (as Ellis Cheever), Chief of Special Pathogens at the Centers for Disease Control, tells Jennifer Ehle (as Ally Hextall), an Epidemiological Intelligence Service officer coordinating research on the fictional henipavirus MEV-1, to move all research from BSL-3 (biosafety level 3) to BSL-4. She, in turn, calls Elliott Gould (as Ian Sussman), a university professor and virologist, telling him to ""cook his samples."" He protests, saying that restricting work to a few BSL-4 laboratories will slow progress. Gould acquiesces but continues his research, ultimately finding a way to grow the virus and make a vaccine. Gould's character is loosely based on my experiences during the West Nile virus outbreak in 1999. Although our team identified the causative agent, political wrangling delayed permitting and shipment of the virus to our laboratory. To expedite diagnostics and drug development, I decided to recover the virus by transfecting genomic viral RNA."
"Seasonal influenza vaccination knowledge, risk perception, health beliefs and vaccination behaviours of nurses","The relationship between knowledge, risk perceptions, health belief towards seasonal influenza and vaccination and the vaccination behaviours of nurses was explored. Qualified nurses attending continuing professional education courses at a large London university between 18 April and 18 October 2010 were surveyed (522/672; response rate 77 . 7 %). Of these, 82 . 6% worked in hospitals ; 37 . 0 % reported receiving seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous season and 44 . 9% reported never being vaccinated during the last 5 years. All respondents were categorized using two-step cluster analyses into never, occasionally, and continuously vaccinated groups. Nurses vaccinated the season before had higher scores of knowledge and risk perception compared to the unvaccinated (P<0 . 001). Nurses never vaccinated had the lowest scores of knowledge and risk perception compared to other groups (P<0 . 001). Nurses' seasonal influenza vaccination behaviours are complex. Knowledge and risk perception predict uptake of vaccination in nurses.","Annual epidemics of seasonal influenza result in about 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 250 000-500 000 deaths worldwide [1] . Healthcare workers (HCWs) can be a key source for influenza transmission in communities and hospitals as they are exposed to both infected patients and high-risk groups [2, 3] . Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes [1] and the principal measure to reduce the impact of epidemics, such as hospitalization, mortality and morbidity [2, [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, studies suggest that the vaccination of HCWs has substantial economic benefits as well as health-related benefits, including reduced absenteeism from work and the extra costs of sick leave and staff replacement [4, 6, 7] ."
,"The 3rd Workshop on Paediatric Virology, which took place on October 7th, 2017 in Athens, Greece, highlighted the role of breast feeding in the prevention of viral infections during the first years of life.

Risk and Outbreak Communication: Lessons from Taiwan's Experiences in the Post-SARS Era,"In addition to the impact of a disease itself, public reaction could be considered another outbreak to be controlled during an epidemic. Taiwan's experience with SARS in 2003 highlighted the critical role played by the media during crisis communication. After the SARS outbreak, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) followed the WHO outbreak communication guidelines on trust, early announcements, transparency, informing the public, and planning, in order to reform its risk communication systems. This article describes the risk communication framework in Taiwan, which has been used to respond to the 2009-2016 influenza epidemics, Ebola in West Africa (2014-16), and MERS-CoV in South Korea (2015) during the post-SARS era. Many communication strategies, ranging from traditional media to social and new media, have been implemented to improve transparency in public communication and promote civic engagement. Taiwan CDC will continue to maintain the strengths of its risk communication systems and resolve challenges as they emerge through active evaluation and monitoring of public opinion to advance Taiwan's capacity in outbreak communication and control. Moreover, Taiwan CDC will continue to implement the IHR (2005) and to promote a global community working together to fight shared risks and to reach the goal of ''One World, One Health.''","R isk communication before and during an outbreak continues to be an issue of great concern for public health researchers and practitioners globally. 1 Risk communication is an interactive process of exchanging information and opinion on risk among risk assessors, risk managers, and other interested parties. 2, 3 It is an integral part of any public health emergency response, as it allows people at risk to understand the threat and adopt protec-tive behaviors. In order to respond to the communication challenges posed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed guidelines on outbreak communication. Among the best practices outlined for effective communication were building trust, making timely announcements, maintaining transparency, informing but not inflaming the public, and planning in advance. 4 In addition, WHO emphasized that risk communication is one of the 8 core functions that WHO member states must fulfill as signatories to the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) . Risk communication is also a component of global and country preparedness for an influenza pandemic, as part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework. 5 Therefore, states parties should have risk communication capacity as measured by the IHR (2005) Joint External Evaluation Tool published by WHO in 2016. 6 One of the most serious public health crises Taiwan has faced was the SARS outbreak in 2003, which resulted in 346 cases and 37 deaths. From this experience, we learned that public panic could be another outbreak to be controlled during an epidemic. In the early stage of the SARS outbreak, 2 events led to massive social panic in Taiwan. First, the demand for face masks surged, creating a shortage in the market, and the problem was compounded by certain retailers hoarding their supplies and waiting for the price to rise. This led to public discontent with the way the government handled the situation and caused significant political fallout. The government was under public pressure to take a more forceful stand, but it overreacted by carrying out the most intensive quarantine campaign in the world at that time. During the SARS epidemic, Taiwan had a total of 346 confirmed cases, yet 151,460 people were put under home quarantine. 7 This means that 437 people were quarantined for every confirmed case-a ratio 10 times that of Hong Kong and 20 times that of Beijing."
Human Coronavirus 229E Remains Infectious on Common Touch Surface Materials,"The evolution of new and reemerging historic virulent strains of respiratory viruses from animal reservoirs is a significant threat to human health. Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.","tained the ability to infect humans. The risk can be increased when individuals have continuous and close contact with animals; also, climate changes can change the distribution of insect vectors and hosts (4, 5) ."
Special Report Challenges in identifying antibiotic resistance targets for point-of-care diagnostics in general practice,"General practitioners stand at the front line of healthcare provision and have a pivotal role in the fight against increasing antibiotic resistance. In this respect, targeted antibiotic prescribing by general practitioners would help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, leading to reduced treatment failures, fewer side-effects for patients and a reduction in the (global) spread of antibiotic resistances. Current 'gold standard' antibiotic resistance detection strategies tend to be slow, taking up to 48 h to obtain a result, although the implementation of point-of-care testing by general practitioners could help achieve the goal of targeted antibiotic prescribing practices. However, deciding on which antibiotic resistances to include in a point-of-care diagnostic is not a trivial task, as outlined in this publication.","The continued spread of antibiotic resistance is a global problem with the WHO predicting 10 million global deaths due to antibiotic resistance by 2050 [1, 2] . One way of helping defeat the emergence of antibiotic resistance is via the accurate prescribing of antibiotics only to those patients who are suffering from bacterial (instead of viral) infections. The problem of accurate antibiotic prescribing is especially relevant for general practitioners (GPs) [3, 4] . GPs stand on the front line of patient care (primary care), most often being the first point of contact between medical specialists and the general public. However, the rapid differentiation between a bacterial and viral infection in primary care patients is especially difficult to achieve, since the patient's history and physical examination have only a limited value in differentiating between a viral and a bacterial infection [5, 6] . Further, if specimens are sent to a centralized diagnostic laboratory for traditional 'gold standard' testing, the results of pathogen isolation, identification and antibiotic resistance detection may take several days to arrive back at the GP practice. Taken together, this means that accurate, evidence-based diagnosis and targeted antibiotic prescribing by GPs are currently problematic. One possible approach to this problem is to implement so called point-of-care (POC) diagnostics at the GP practice and many different POC diagnostics are currently available, or are being developed, to detect infectious diseases [7] . These POC diagnostics can be generally divided into three 'classes': POC diagnostics that differentiate between bacterial and viral infections (without defining which pathogen is present), for example, diagnostics based on inflammatory biomarkers; POC diagnostics that detect and report a specific pathogen that may be present, but (in case of a bacterial infection) do not provide information on the presence of antibiotic resistances, for example, diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification techniques; and POC diagnostics that detect and report a specific pathogen and the presence of antibiotic resistance, for example, diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification techniques coupled to microarrays. The ability to accurately differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection may help enormously in reducing the amount of unnecessary antibiotics prescribed to patients suffering from viral infections. This may Table 1 . Potential problems and possible solutions to choosing antibiotic resistance targets for incorporation in point-of-care diagnostics for use by general practitioners."
RHINOVIRUS DETECTION USING DIFFERENT PCR-BASED STRATEGIES,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the major cause of the common cold. HRVs were recently reclassified into the Enterovirus genus (HEV) in the Picornaviridae family. HRVs and other members of the HEV genus share many common features, including sense RNA genomes and partial nucleotide sequence identity. The aim of this study was to evaluate different HRV detection strategies. Samples from adults with acute respiratory infection (n = 291) who were treated in Sao Paulo Hospital (2001Hospital ( -2003 were tested using three assays. The first assay detected picornaviruses by RT-PCR and hybridization, the second detected rhinoviruses using RT-PCR/sequencing, and the third differentiated HRV from HEV using duplex seminested-RT-PCR. Analysis of the results obtained from the first two strategies revealed 83% concordance.","Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the major cause of common cold symptoms, and they are the most frequent causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections (13) . HRVs were discovered in 1956 (16) and are now classified, along with enterovirus species, as members of the Enterovirus genus (22) in the Picornaviridae family. These viruses share many common features, including a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid, a sense RNA genome and partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity (19) ."
Serological survey of Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection in cats in Japan,"Antibodies to Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using E. cuniculi PTP2 recombinant protein from serum samples that had been collected from a total of 295 cats in Japan. Of these samples, 6.1% (18/295) had antibodies against E. cuniculi, which included 6.3% (6/96) of the male cats and 6.0% (12/199) of the female cats. The incidence was slightly higher in feral cats (8.3%, 11/132) compared to domesticated cats (4.3%, 7/163). This suggests the possibility that the cats of our country have become a reservoir of E. cuniculi. This study is the first to demonstrate the prevalence of E. cuniculi infection in cats in Japan.","Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) is an obligate intracellular microsporidian parasite and infects a wide range of mammalian hosts, such as rabbits, rodents, dogs and humans [10, 11, 15] . E. cuniculi is an opportunistic pathogen in human patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other immunocompromised people [3, 8] . Infected animals are arguably the reservoirs of human encephalitozoonosis [3] . Encephalitozoonosis is commonly observed in rabbits, and therefore, clinical assessment and diagnosis is well established in this species [8] . Although infections due to E. cuniculi are not common in cats, E. cuniculi infections have been reported to occur in cats abroad [2, 8, 14] . One author reported that the potential role of cats in the transmission of the infectious agent cannot be excluded [14] . In Japan, a seroepidemiological survey of E. cuniculi infection in domesticated dogs and domesticated rabbits has been performed [7, 16] , but the prevalence of E. cuniculi infections in cats has not been reported. E. cuniculi in subclinically infected cats may represent a reservoir and potential risk for immunocompromised patients [11, 12] . The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of E. cuniculi in cats in Japan to serve as baseline epidemiologic data and a potential source of microsporidial infection in Japan. In addition, we compared the seropositive rate of domesticated cats with feral cats."

Although the principle may be straightforward, this review highlights some of the controversies regarding the implementation and efficacy of these interventions.","Hand hygiene and patient isolation are two basic principles that have long been recognized as effective methods of reducing hospital-acquired infections. However, the optimal methods for implementation and monitoring of such programmes are not straightforward."

However, unlike clustering patterns of the complete gene sequences of human and camel MERS-CoVs, the 4a and 4b protein coding regions did not constitute species-specific phylogenetic groups. Moreover, given the estimated evolutionary rates of the complete, 4a, and 4b gene sequences, the 4a and 4b proteins might be less affected by species-specific innate immune pressures. These results suggest that the 4a and 4b proteins of MERS-CoV may function against host innate immunity in a manner independent of host species and/or evolutionary clustering patterns.","host innate immunity can be revealed by analysis of the evolutionary relationship of the 4a and 4b genes between human and camel MERS-CoV strains. To this end, we investigated the evolutionary history and rates of MERS-CoV 4a and 4b protein coding regions as well as those of MERS-CoV complete gene sequences using a time-framed Bayesian inference method (BEAST package, v1.10.0; BEAST, New Zealand) [12] with individual settings of molecular clock (for complete gene, lognormal relaxed clock model and for 4a and 4b coding regions, strict clock model), nucleotide substitution (based on the estimated results of best-fit substitution model using jModeltest, v2.1.10: for complete gene, GTR + I + γ; for 4a, TN93 + I; and for 4b, TN93 + γ) [13] , and Markov chain Monte Carlo runs (2 × 10 8 chain length with every 2 × 10 5 iterations after a 10% burn-in). The phylogenetic relationship of MERS-CoV complete gene sequences was reconstructed using a total of 260 sequences (human strains, n = 126 and camel strains, n = 134; sequence sets are available upon request) that were downloaded from the Virus Variation Resource database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/), and their maximum clade credibility trees were visualized using FigTree (v1.4.3; Figtree Systems Pty, Australia). Given the phylogenetic relationship of the complete gene sequences, most camel sequences constituted 5 different genetic groups (camel G1-G5), except for some distantly-related sequences, and the camel G2, G3, and G4 strains appeared to evolve exclusively from human strains. Transmission of MERS-CoV between humans and camels appeared to be identified only in the camel G1 and G5 groups (Fig. 1) ."

"Clinical Infectious Diseases Clinical and Epidemiologic Patterns of Chikungunya Virus Infection and Coincident Arboviral Disease in a School Cohort in Haiti, 2014-2015","Background. Beginning in December 2013, an epidemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection spread across the Caribbean and into virtually all countries in the Western hemisphere, with >2.4 million cases reported through the end of 2017.","The past few decades have been characterized by the emergence and geographic expansion of a series of arboviruses, including dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV1-DENV4), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [1] , and Zika virus (ZIKV) [2] . In December 2013, CHIKV (Asian clade) was identified for the first time in the Western Hemisphere, on the Island of St Martin in the Caribbean [3] . From St Martin, an epidemic wave of CHIKV infection moved across the Caribbean and spread into virtually every country in the hemisphere, with >2.4 million cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization through the end of 2017 [4] . Although the CHIKV epidemic caused substantial morbidity, during the same time period (2013-2017) and in the same region >8.8 million dengue cases were reported to the Pan American Health Organization [5] , together with >800 000 suspected and confirmed ZIKV infections [5] , underscoring the magnitude and diversity of arboviral infections within the population."

SUPPLEMENTAL TEXT MATERIALS AND METHODS,"A draft genome was produced using reads from both the Illumina HiSeq and Roche 454 platforms using the following pipeline: first Illumina HiSeq reads were filtered and corrected using the standalone read correction tool ErrorCorrectReads.pl available with ALLPATHS-LG (1). Resulting reads were filtered for possible cross-contamination by aligning reads against human, rhesus macaque monkey and mycoplasma reference genomes using the tool Bowtie2 (2) and removed from subsequent processing steps. Due to their larger read length, Roche 454 single-end reads were filtered for contamination from the same sources using DECONSEQ (3). Reads aligned to the above contaminant genomes with 90% identity over at least 90% of their length were removed from further steps unless they also mapped to T. gondii. In addition, for paired-end reads, if either end of the read was aligned under default parameters with any of these possible contaminant genomes, both ends were removed from the data set. Single-end reads were then assembled using the short read assembler Ray (4), using a kmer value of 41 and default parameters. All contigs greater than 500 bp (N50=12,617) were subsequently split into pseudoreads of length 400 bp, with 200 bp of overlap remaining between adjacent pseudo-reads to maximize support for pre-assembled contig continuity in the next assembly step. Next, after filtering for adapter sequence contamination, 454 reads were combined with the filtered pairedend set of Illumina sequence data and assembled using Newbler v2.8 (454 Life Sciences, Roche Applied Science, Branford, CT). Subsequently, single-end Illumina reads assembled by Ray were added to the assembly project as pseudo-reads in a strategy that has previously been demonstrated in two diverse genome projects (5, 6). 75 contigs under 2000 bp in length were removed from the Newbler assembly as they aligned with the human genome using Bowtie2 with default settings. All 454 reads and assembled pseudo-reads were required to overlap by at least 90 bp with 98% identity. During assembly we ensured that all reads were used only once.","MAKER. Gene models were first predicted using the program's est2genome prediction model. Gene models and HMM profiles were then refined seven times through iterative MAKER runs using the same physical evidence as above. Output from this final iteration of SNAP predictions, as well as the predictions from the self-trained Genemark-ES and Augustus were then combined using the tool EVM. EVM also utilized RNAseq evidence aligned against the S. neurona genome using Tophat and cufflinks. Protein and EST alignments were also provided using exonerate according to parameters specificied by EVM. An assembled alignment of cufflinks transcripts and EST transcripts from S. neurona was also provided by PASA using default parameters."
"Veterinary Science pISSN 1229-845X, eISSN 1976-555X","Calf diarrhea is a commonly reported disease in young animals, and still a major cause of productivity and economic loss to cattle producers worldwide. In the report of the 2007 National Animal Health Monitoring System for U.S. dairy, half of the deaths among unweaned calves was attributed to diarrhea. Multiple pathogens are known or postulated to cause or contribute to calf diarrhea development. Other factors including both the environment and management practices influence disease severity or outcomes. The multifactorial nature of calf diarrhea makes this disease hard to control effectively in modern cow-calf operations. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of a) the ecology and pathogenesis of well-known and potential bovine enteric pathogens implicated in calf diarrhea, b) describe diagnostic tests used to detect various enteric pathogens along with their pros and cons, and c) propose improved intervention strategies for treating calf diarrhea.","Calf diarrhea (also known as calf scouring) is a commonly reported disease and a major cause of economic loss to cattle producers. The 2007 National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) for U.S. dairy [135] reported that 57% of weaning calf mortality was due to diarrhea and most cases occurred in calves less than 1 month old. A similar mortality rate (53.4%) for dairy calves due to calf diarrhea was recently reported in Korea [61] . The economic loss associated with calf death in Norway where calf production is 280,000 heads per year was estimated to be approximately 10 million US dollars in 2006 [103] ."
ARTICLE Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variant rs12252-C is associated with severe influenza in Chinese individuals,"The SNP rs12252-C allele alters the function of interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 increasing the disease severity of influenza virus infection in Caucasians, but the allele is rare. However, rs12252-C is much more common in Han Chinese. Here we report that the CC genotype is found in 69% of Chinese patients with severe pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 virus infection compared with 25% in those with mild infection. Specifically, the CC genotype was estimated to confer a sixfold greater risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes. More importantly, because the risk genotype occurs with such a high frequency, its effect translates to a large population-attributable risk of 54.3% for severe infection in the Chinese population studied compared with 5.4% in Northern Europeans. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variants could, therefore, have a strong effect of the epidemiology of influenza in China and in people of Chinese descent.","T here is strong evidence that the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) protein is a virus restriction factor mediating cellular resistance to influenza viruses and other viruses that enter cells via the acidic endosome [1] [2] [3] . The importance of IFITM3 in influenza virus infection was determined by Everitt et al. 4 who showed that severity of influenza virus infection was greatly increased in IFITM3 knockout mice compared with wild-type animals. In humans, the rare SNP rs12252-C allele of IFITM3 truncates the protein, leading to reduced restriction of virus replication in vitro 4, 5 . In Northern European patients infected and hospitalized with seasonal influenza or pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 (pH1N1/09) virus, there was an increased homozygosity of the minor C allele of SNP rs12252 in IFITM3 (5.7 versus 0.3%, n ¼ 53). This was the first direct evidence for a host genetic influence on influenza severity in humans. However, because of the rarity of the susceptibility allele (minor allele frequency ¼ 0.034) in people of Northern European descent, the overall effect on the severity of pandemic or seasonal influenza virus in the population is likely to be small. However, the frequency of the IFITM3 rs12252 susceptibility allele is known to be much higher in Han Chinese (minor allele frequency ¼ 0.5)."
Complete viral RNA genome sequencing of ultra-low copy samples by sequence-independent amplification,"RNA viruses are the causative agents for AIDS, influenza, SARS, and other serious health threats. Development of rapid and broadly applicable methods for complete viral genome sequencing is highly desirable to fully understand all aspects of these infectious agents as well as for surveillance of viral pandemic threats and emerging pathogens. However, traditional viral detection methods rely on prior sequence or antigen knowledge. In this study, we describe sequenceindependent amplification for samples containing ultra-low amounts of viral RNA coupled with Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly optimized for viral genomes. With 5 million reads, we capture 96 to 100% of the viral protein coding region of HIV, respiratory syncytial and West Nile viral samples from as little as 100 copies of viral RNA. The methods presented here are scalable to large numbers of samples and capable of generating full or near full length viral genomes from clone and clinical samples with low amounts of viral RNA, without prior sequence information and in the presence of substantial host contamination.","Massively parallel sequencing allows for rapid and low-cost deep sequencing of viral genomes and provides an opportunity to gain greater insight into viral evolution, fitness, emergence and transmission. Currently, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers designed to amplify specific viral RNA sequences is the most common method for amplifying RNA viruses prior to sequencing and other downstream applications. Recent studies have used both 454 (1-11) (Newman et al., manuscript submitted) and Illumina (12) (13) (14) sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons for RNA viruses. However, standard RT-PCR methods are not adequate for the generation of templates suitable for sequencing low-copy viral RNA samples, where labor-intensive methods such as nested PCR (15) or single-genome amplification (SGA) (16, 17) are typically required. Examples of low-copy viral RNA samples include the following: HIV controllers (capable of controlling the virus in the absence of antiretroviral therapy) (18) , dengue virus (DENV) clinical samples collected after peak viremia (19) , and West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance samples (20) . Obtaining genomic sequence from such samples can provide valuable insights into viral attenuation, response to host immune pressure and drug treatment during infection, disease severity, transmission and epidemic spread."
C3P3-G1: first generation of a eukaryotic artificial cytoplasmic expression system,"Most eukaryotic expression systems make use of host-cell nuclear transcriptional and posttranscriptional machineries. Here, we present the first generation of the chimeric cytoplasmic cappingprone phage polymerase (C3P3-G1) expression system developed by biological engineering, which generates capped and polyadenylated transcripts in host-cell cytoplasm by means of two components. First, an artificial single-unit chimeric enzyme made by fusing an mRNA capping enzyme and a DNAdependent RNA polymerase. Second, specific DNA templates designed to operate with the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which encode for the transcripts and their artificial polyadenylation. This system, which can potentially be adapted to any in cellulo or in vivo eukaryotic expression applications, was optimized for transient expression in mammalian cells. C3P3-G1 shows promising results for protein production in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. This work also provides avenues for enhancing the performances for next generation C3P3 systems.","Despite their broad uses in life sciences, transient expression by plasmid-based expression systems has significant drawbacks. First, the transfer of plasmid DNA from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a rate-limiting process in nondividing cells. This limits efficient plasmid-based expression systems to dividing cells, in which this barrier is overcome by temporary disassembly of the nuclear membrane during mitosis (1, 2) . Such limited transfer to the nucleus of exogenous DNA in quiescent cells is a potential drawback for the efficacy of non-viral gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Second, plasmid-based expression depends on host cell nuclear RNA polymerase II (polII), a moderately processive enzyme with a rate of elongation of 25 and 6 nucleotides/second in vitro and in cellulo, respectively (3, 4) . Third, standard plasmid-based eukaryotic expression exploits the host cell transcriptional machinery and thereby competes with the host cell genome for transgene expression (4) . Together, these challenges are thought to limit the efficacy of the standard eukaryotic expression systems."
Predicting Mortality in Patients with Tuberculous Destroyed Lung Receiving Mechanical Ventilation Prognosis for TDL on mechanical ventilation Conflicts of Interest,"Patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to tuberculous destroyed lung (TDL) have a poor prognosis. The aim of the present retrospective study was to develop a mortality prediction model for TDL patients who require mechanical ventilation. Methods: Data from consecutive TDL patients who had received mechanical ventilation at a single university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Korea were reviewed. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. A TDL on mechanical Ventilation (TDL-Vent) score was calculated by assigning points to variables according to β coefficient values. Results: Data from 125 patients were reviewed. A total of 36 patients (29%) died during ICU admission. On the basis of multivariate analysis, the following factors were included in the TDL-Vent score: age ≥65 years, vasopressor use, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <180. In a second regression model, a modified score was then calculated by adding brain natriuretic peptide. For TDL-Vent scores 0 to 3, the 60-day mortality rates were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (p<0.001). For modified TDL-Vent scores 0 to ≥3, the 60-day mortality rates were 0%, 21%, 33%, and 57%, respectively (p=0.001). For both the TDL-Vent score and the modified TDL-Vent score, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were larger than that of other illness severity scores.","Tuberculous destroyed lung (TDL) results from inadequate treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and progressive destruction of one or both lungs 1 . In Korea, TDL is a common cause of pulmonary disability and respiratory failure, and the reported mortality rate is as high as 61% 2 . A previous study by Ryu et al. 3 revealed that TDL was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation."
"Detection of rickettsial DNA in ticks and wild boars in Kyoto City, Japan","The tick is a well-known vector for arthropod-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, Japanese spotted fever and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. It is therefore important to know the tick population and distribution in our environment and wild animals in order to prevent tick-borne diseases. Here, we report the results of tick surveillance from May to September 2011 at 14 geographical points and in 5 wild boars in Kyoto City, Kyoto prefecture, Japan. We collected 3,198 ticks comprising 5 tick species, Haemaphysalis (H.) longicornis, H. flava, H. kitaokai, Amblyomma testudinarium and Dermacentor taiwanensis. Interestingly, the proportion of tick species varied according to geographical region within the city. The ticks collected in the city were reported as potential vectors of pathogens, such as rickettsiosis. We detected rickettsial DNA by PCR in 71.1% of 201 ticks investigated. The ticks that carried rickettsiae were distributed across the whole the city. The sequences of PCR-amplified DNA fragments were determined and showed similarities to spotted fever group rickettsiae. Although their pathogenicity for animals including humans is still unclear, it is important to stay alert and pay attention to tick-borne diseases in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the city as well as that of visitors.","Arthropods transmit zoonotic pathogens to animals including humans [12, 22] . In Japan, tick-borne encephalitis [29] , Lyme disease [17] , Japanese spotted fever [21] and other tick-borne diseases have been classically reported. Additionally, some cases of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), whose etiological agents were potentially transmitted by ticks, were reported in early 2013 in the western region of Japan [28] . Ticks might also harbor unknown pathogens that could cause emerging infections in animals and humans. Therefore, it is important to study tick ecology and to survey the vector-borne pathogens in ticks."
Tumor-Treating Fields Induce RAW264.7 Macrophage Activation Via NK-kB/MAPK Signaling Pathways,"Objective: Tumor-treating fields are currently used to successfully treat various cancers; however, the specific pathways associated with its efficacy remain unknown in the immune responses. Here, we evaluated tumor-treating fields-mediated initiation of the macrophage-specific immune response. Materials and Methods: We subjected RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages to clinically relevant levels of tumor-treating fields (0.9 V/cm, 150 kHz) and evaluated alterations in cytokine expression and release, as well as cell viability. Additionally, we investigated the status of immunomodulatory pathways to determine their roles in tumor-treating fields-mediated immune activation. Results and Discussion: Our results indicated that tumor-treating fields treatment at 0.9 V/cm decreased cell viability and increased cytokine messenger RNA/protein levels, as well as levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, relative to controls. The levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 1b, and interleukin 6 were markedly increased in tumor-treating fields-treated RAW 264.7 cells cocultured with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells compared with those in 4T1 or RAW 264.7 cells with or without tumor-treating fields treatment. Moreover, the viability of 4T1 cells treated with the conditioned medium of tumor-treating fields-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by tumor-treating fields effectively killed the tumor cells. Moreover, tumor-treating fields treatment activated the nuclear factor kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways involved in immunomodulatory signaling. Conclusion: These results provide critical insights into the mechanisms through which tumor-treating fields affect macrophagespecific immune responses and the efficacy of this method for cancer treatment.","Tumor-treating fields (TTFs) therapy, in which small electric fields are pulsed through the skin to disturb mitosis, represents a noninvasive, regional treatment modality that was recently approved for the therapy of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) by the US Food and Drug Administration and gained a CE mark in Europe. [1] [2] [3] The clinical concept is that TTFs therapy delivers low-intensity (0.9-3 V/cm), intermediate-frequency (100-300 kHz), and alternating electric fields to the tumor using transducer arrays placed on the skin around the tumor site. 4 The proposed mechanisms of action involve disruption of the metaphase of tumor cells by interfering with mitotic spindle formation and disruption of anaphase by the dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents, resulting in an overall effect of apoptosis. 3 The antimitotic effect of TTFs treatment has been showed in various cell lines as well as in GBM by tuning the appropriate frequency to specific cancer cell types. [5] [6] [7] A phase III trial of TTFs combined with temozolomide established that this treatment protocol led to minimal toxicity, increased the overall survival rate, and improved patient quality of life with equivalent therapeutic efficacy to chemotherapy. Moreover, in addition to its combination with chemotherapy, synergistic enhancement of the cellular response was reported when TTFs were administered in combination with radiation therapy. Thus, with these merits, ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFs to treat various cancer types, including newly diagnosed GBM, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer."
Unported License October 2018 | 140 | e58110 |,"The Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce inflammation in immunoprivileged organs (e.g., the brain and testis), leading to the Guillain-Barré syndrome and damaging the testes. During an infection with the ZIKV, immune cells have been shown to infiltrate into the tissues. However, the cellular mechanisms that define the protection and/or immunopathogenesis of these immune cells during a ZIKV infection are still largely unknown. Herein, we describe methods to evaluate the virus-specific T-cell functionality in these immunoprivileged organs of ZIKV-infected mice. These methods include a) a ZIKV infection and vaccine inoculation in Ifnar1 -/mice; b) histopathology, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry assays to detect the virus infection and inflammation in the brain, testes, and spleen; c) the preparation of a tetramer of ZIKV-derived T-cell epitopes; d) the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in the monocytes isolated from the brain, testes, and spleen. Using these approaches, it is possible to detect the antigen-specific T cells that have infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs and to evaluate the functions of these T cells during the infection: potential immune protection via virus clearance and/or immunopathogenesis to exacerbate the inflammation. These findings may also help to clarify the contribution of T cells induced by the immunization against ZIKV.","The ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first isolated in 1947 in Uganda from a febrile rhesus macaque. Recently, the ZIKV has become a public health emergency, due to its rapid dissemination in the Americas and its unexpected link to microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome 1, 2, 3 . From epidemiological data, the ZIKV has been suspected to be the cause of the Guillain-Barré syndrome in around 1 per 4,000 infected adults 4 . Moreover, a correlation between the ZIKV and testes infection/damage in the mouse model has been demonstrated, suggesting that the ZIKV infection, under certain circumstances, can bypass the blood-testis barrier and eventually lead to male infertility 5 . These findings highlight the importance of completely understanding the induction of protective or pathologic immune responses during a ZIKV infection."
Characteristics of human infection with avian influenza viruses and development of new antiviral agents,"Since 1997, several epizootic avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been transmitted to humans, causing diseases and even deaths. The recent emergence of severe human infections with AIV (H7N9) in China has raised concerns about efficient interpersonal viral transmission, polygenic traits in viral pathogenicity and the management of newly emerging strains. The symptoms associated with viral infection are different in various AI strains: H5N1 and newly emerged H7N9 induce severe pneumonia and related complications in patients, while some H7 and H9 subtypes cause only conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms. The virulence and tissue tropism of viruses as well as the host responses contribute to the pathogenesis of human AIV infection. Several preventive and therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat AIV infection, including antiviral drugs such as M2 inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, attachment inhibitors and signal-transduction inhibitors etc. In this article, we summarize the recent progress in researches on the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenicity determinants, and available or potential antivirals of AIV.","Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a potential source for the emergence of human influenza pandemics. Historically, several harmful influenza pandemics have originated from AIVs through genetic reassortment between human and avian influenza strains, as happened in the 1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, and 1968 H3N2 pandemics [1, 2] . The unprecedented emergence of H5N1 human infections in 1997 provided the first evidence that AIV could directly transmit from poultry to humans [3] . Since February 2013, there have been cases of severe human infection with H7N9 AIV in China; this AIV strain consists of genes from three AIV strains and is viewed as a pandemic threat [4] ."
An mRNA Vaccine Protects Mice against Multiple Tick- Transmitted Flavivirus Infections HHS Public Access,"Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-transmitted flavivirus that circulates in North America and Russia. Up to 5% of deer ticks now test positive for POWV in certain regions of the northern United States. Although POWV infections cause life-threatening encephalitis, there is no vaccine or counter-measure available for prevention or treatment. Here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding the POWV prM and E genes and demonstrated its immunogenicity and efficacy in mice following immunization with one or two doses. The POWV mRNA vaccine induced high titers of neutralizing antibody and sterilizing immunity against lethal challenge with different POWV strains. The mRNA vaccine also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple other tick-borne flaviviruses and protected mice against the distantly related Langat virus. These data demonstrate the utility of the LNP-mRNA",vaccine platform for the development of vaccines with protective activity against multiple flaviviruses.
Cooperativity Enables Non-neutralizing Antibodies to Neutralize Ebolavirus,Graphical Abstract Highlights d We describe cooperative neutralization and in vivo protection d Cooperativity turns non-neutralizing ebolavirus antibodies into potent neutralizers d A hotspot for antibody cooperativity identified on Ebola virus glycoprotein,"In Brief Howell et al. describe the phenomenon of ''enabling, cooperative neutralization'' where weakly neutralizing and/or nonneutralizing ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies exhibit potent neutralization when combined. The previously identified antibodies m8C4 and FVM09, which are non-protective alone, offer 100% protection against Ebola and Sudan virus challenge in mice when combined."
Detection rate and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease,"The purpose of this prospective case-control study was to survey the detection rate of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) by using multiplex reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to investigate the clinical implications of the prevalence of respiratory viruses during the acute phase of KD. Methods: RT-PCR assays were carried out to screen for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions of 55 KD patients and 78 control subjects. Results: Virus detection rates in KD patients and control subjects were 32.7% and 30.8%, respectively (P=0.811). However, there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 viruses and the incidence of KD. Comparisons between the 18 patients with positive RT-PCR results and the other 37 KD patients revealed no significant differences in terms of clinical findings (including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of the disease) and coronary artery diameter. Conclusion: A positive RT-PCR for currently epidemic respiratory viruses should not be used as an evidence against the diagnosis of KD. These viruses were not associated with the incomplete presentation of KD and coronary artery dilatation.","Respiratory symptoms are frequently observed in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) during the acute phase. The association rate of KD with antecedent respiratory illness has been reported to be 56 to 83% 1, 2) . Laboratory evaluation for detection of respiratory viruses is occasionally performed in febrile children with respiratory symptoms before confirmation of the diagnosis of KD. Recently, molecular diagnostic tests, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been more frequently used as a laboratory method, because molecular diagnostic tests for the detection of all epidemic respiratory tract infection-related viruses allow a thorough etiological assessment and better management of children with respiratory tract infection 3) . However, we propose that identification of respiratory virus during the diagnostic evaluation of febrile children with respiratory symptoms cannot be used as exclusive evidence against the diagnosis of KD. In one study without control subjects, the identification rate of respiratory viruses through multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in children with KD was reported to be 22% 4) ."
Novel insights into endogenous RNA viral elements in Ixodes scapularis and other arbovirus vector genomes,"Many emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand flies. Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya-and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the nonstructural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of nonlong terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","Over 100 million people contract arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) each year (WHO 2014) . Many arboviruses are classified as emerging diseases, meaning their incidence is rapidly increasing; additionally, a large proportion lack preventative measures or treatment (Jones et al. 2008 ; LaBeaud, Bashir, and V C The Author(s) 2019.

Travel-acquired infections and illnesses in Canadians: surveillance report from CanTravNet surveillance data,"Background: Important knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of migration medicine practice and the impact of pathogens imported by Canadian travellers. We present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants.","➢ Canadians represent an inCreasingly mobile population. The more affordable nature of air travel, the globalization of trade and commerce, the greater representation of developing-world immigrants within the Canadian population, and a trend toward ""voluntourism"" and ecotourism have all contributed to a greater number of Canadians crossing international borders than ever before. The stereotypical beachdestination vacationer is increasingly being replaced with off-the-beaten-path backpackers, new Canadian immigrants and their family members returning home to visit friends and relatives, last-minute business travellers, and researchers, missionaries, and volunteers heading to ever more exotic locales. This paradigm shift is supported by data from the World Tourism Organization and Statistics Canada. For example, in 2011, Canadians spent US$33 billion on international tourism, up from US$29.6 billion in 2010. 1 Along with traditional destinations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, tropical and developingworld destinations, including Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, are among the top 10 foreign destinations chosen by Canadian travellers. 2 Travelling to the developing world necessarily puts travellers and migrants at risk for communicable infectious diseases, with 20%-70% of returned travellers suffering some sort of illness. [3] [4] [5] Although single-centre studies in other countries and multinational studies of travel-acquired illness have been conducted, a comprehensive multicentre comparison of the spectrum of illnesses acquired by a broad range of Canadian travellers returning from regions on all continents has been lacking. Understanding of the range and frequency of infectious diseases in Canadian travellers is based primarily on existing synthesized knowledge of travelacquired illness in other populations. Expert references such as the World Health Organization's International Travel and Health 6 and the so-called ""Yellow Book"" published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7 as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada's Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT; www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/catmat -ccmtmv/index-eng.php), provide guidance to practitioners, yet data specifically focusing on Canadian travellers in support of recommendations from these sources are lacking. Furthermore, although many imported communicable diseases are designated as nationally notifiable to the Public Health Agency of Canada, 8 the quality of data accrued is hindered by delayed reporting and underreporting, which have led to ""an incomplete picture of the incidence of communicable diseases in Canada."" 9 We synthesized Canada-specific surveillance data on ill returned travellers with the goal of informing provincial-and national-level public health policy and strategic initiatives to reduce the incidence of preventable infections, increase the efficiency of public health infrastructure, and improve the uptake of preventive pretravel care. In addition, this analysis provides accurate epidemiologic data about travel-associated infectious diseases in travellers returning to Canada, which are necessary to guide clinical decision-making by front-line Canadian practitioners."
Comprehensive viral oligonucleotide probe design using conserved protein regions,"Oligonucleotide microarrays have been applied to microbial surveillance and discovery where highly multiplexed assays are required to address a wide range of genetic targets. Although printing density continues to increase, the design of comprehensive microbial probe sets remains a daunting challenge, particularly in virology where rapid sequence evolution and database expansion confound static solutions. Here, we present a strategy for probe design based on protein sequences that is responsive to the unique problems posed in virus detection and discovery. The method uses the Protein Families database (Pfam) and motif finding algorithms to identify oligonucleotide probes in conserved amino acid regions and untranslated sequences. In silico testing using an experimentally derived thermodynamic model indicated near complete coverage of the viral sequence database.","The capacity of DNA microarrays to simultaneously screen for hundreds of viral agents makes them an attractive supplement to traditional methods in microbiology. Their utility has been demonstrated through detection of papilloma virus in cervical lesions (1) , SARS coronavirus in tissue culture (2) , parainfluenza virus 4 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (3) , influenza from nasal wash and throat swabs (4, 5) , gammaretrovirus in prostate tumors (6) , coronaviruses and rhinoviruses from nasal lavage (7) , metapneumovirus from bronchoalveolar lavage (8) , filoviruses and malarial parasites in blood in hemorrhagic fever (9) , and a wide variety of respiratory pathogens in nasal swabs and lung tissue (10) . Viral microarrays have increased in density and strain coverage as fabrication technologies have improved. cDNA pathogen arrays derived from reference strain nucleic acids (11, 12) have been replaced by oligonucleotide arrays due to their increased flexibility. Oligonucleotide design strategies have focused on pairwise sequence comparisons to identify conserved regions within a variety of viral pathogens (13) (14) (15) . Multiple alignments have been used to design probes for clinically important virus genera, e.g. rotaviruses (16) , orthopoxviruses (17) or influenzaviruses (18) . Viral resequencing arrays have recently been introduced that allow single nucleotide resolution (4, (19) (20) (21) . Although such tiling arrays enable accurate typing, the number of probes required to build a resequencing array for all viral sequences exceeds current art."
"Understanding the canine intestinal microbiota and its modification by pro-, pre-and synbiotics -what is the evidence?","Interest in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and possibilities of its therapeutic modifications has soared over the last decade and more detailed knowledge specific to the canine microbiota at different mucosal sites including the gut is available. Probiotics, prebiotics or their combination (synbiotics) are a way of modifying the intestinal microbiota and exert effects on the host immune response. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways, for example production of antimicrobial peptides, enhancing growth of favourable endogenous microorganisms, competition for epithelial colonisation sites and immunemodulatory functions. Despite widespread use of pro-, pre-and synbiotics, scientific evidence of their beneficial effects in different conditions of the dog is scarce. Specific effects of different strains, their combination or their potential side-effects have not been evaluated sufficiently. In some instances, in vitro results have been promising, but could not be transferred consistently into in vivo situations. Specific canine gastrointestinal (GI) diseases or conditions where probiotics would be beneficial, their most appropriate dosage and application have not been assessed extensively. This review summarises the current knowledge of the intestinal microbiome composition in the dog and evaluates the evidence for probiotic use in canine GI diseases to date. It wishes to provide veterinarians with evidence-based information on when and why these products could be useful in preventing or treating canine GI conditions. It also outlines knowledge about safety and approval of commercial probiotic products, and the potential use of faecal microbial transplantation, as they are related to the topic of probiotic usage.","Microorganisms are found abundantly in association with mammalian hosts; in fact, the number of microbial cells is around 10 times that of host cells (Gibson & Roberfroid 1995) , consisting of around 1000 times more microbial genes (The Human Microbiome Project; www.http://hmpdacc.org). The concept of the microbiome was first suggested by Joshua Lederberg, who coined the term 'microbiome' to 'signify the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space' (Lederberg & McCray 2001) . It is generally accepted that the term 'microbiota' (in the past also referred to as microflora) is used to describe bacterial communities on mucosal surfaces (with or without luminal microorganisms) or on other body sites (e.g. skin). Overlapping, but distinct, the term 'microbiome' is nowadays used to refer to the entire genetic mass ('genome') of microorganisms. It is mostly, but incorrectly, used to describe bacterial genomic communities. One should probably refer specifically to the 'bacteriome', 'virome' (Mansfield 2015) or 'mycobiome' (Foster et al. 2013) , respectively, and use the term microbiome globally for all microorganisms combined (ten Oever & Netea 2014). These microorganisms include eucaryotes, archaea, bacteria, viruses and fungi. Living in such close contact, they usually are not harmful to the host; but considered beneficial in most cases. For example the intestinal microbiota supplies shortchain fatty acids (SCFA) as nutrients for colonocytes (Cummings 1981; R erat et al. 1987; Cummings & Macfarlane 1991) ."
RNA dimerization plays a role in ribosomal frameshifting of the SARS coronavirus,"Messenger RNA encoded signals that are involved in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) are typically two-stemmed hairpin (H)-type pseudoknots (pks). We previously described an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) that stimulated -1 PRF. The conserved existence of a third stem-loop suggested an important hitherto unknown function. Here we present new information describing structure and function of the third stem of the SARS pseudoknot. We uncovered RNA dimerization through a palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3. Further in vitro analysis revealed that SARS-CoV RNA dimers assemble through 'kissing' loop-loop interactions. We also show that loop-loop kissing complex formation becomes more efficient at physiological temperature and in the presence of magnesium. When the palindromic sequence was mutated, in vitro RNA dimerization was abolished, and frameshifting was reduced from 15 to 5.7%. Furthermore, the inability to dimerize caused by the silent codon change in Stem 3 of SARS-CoV changed the viral growth kinetics and affected the levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells. These results suggest that the homodimeric RNA complex formed by the SARS pseudoknot occurs in the cellular environment and that loop-loop kissing interactions involving Stem 3 modulate -1 PRF and play a role in subgenomic and full-length RNA synthesis.","A novel coronavirus was responsible for the sudden epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, in 2003. Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with large genomes [$30 000 nucleotides (nt)] that serve as templates for translation of viral proteins and for replication. The production of proteins from these viral RNAs does not follow the usual rules governing translation. The first polyprotein encoded by open reading frame (ORF)1a, which encodes non-structural proteins, is defined by initiation and termination codons and is translated normally. Signals embedded within the RNA just before the termination codon of ORF1a redirect a fraction of translating ribosomes to bypass the stop codon and continue translation in the -1 reading frame, thus creating the larger ORF1ab polyprotein (1-3). These programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) stimulating signals are typically composed of a heptameric slippery site, on which the ribosome can change register by 1 nt in the 5 0 direction, followed by a pseudoknot. Slippery site sequence requirements have been characterized for several cell types (4) but the range and diversity of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots continues to grow (5) ."
Treating the Host Response to Ebola Virus Disease with Generic Statins and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers,"Treatments targeting the Ebola virus may eventually be shown to work, but they will not have an impact on overall Ebola mortality in West Africa. Endothelial dysfunction is responsible for the fluid and electrolyte imbalances seen in Ebola patients. Because inexpensive generic statins and angiotensin receptor blockers restore endothelial barrier integrity, they can be used to treat the host response in these patients. In Sierra Leone, approximately 100 Ebola patients were treated with this combination, and reports indicate that survival was greatly improved.","T he Ebola outbreak that has devastated West Africa this past year may be receding, but it is far from over. Clinical trials of experimental antiviral agents, antibody preparations, and vaccines have begun, but even if these agents are effective, supplies will be limited and all of them will be costly (1) . By themselves, they will not affect the course of the current outbreak or have much impact on its overall mortality. To improve patient survival, a different approach to treatment will be needed."
NOTE Preparation of a cell line persistently infected with maedi/visna virus and production of viral antigens,"We attempted to prepare a cell line that produces maedi/visna virus (MVV) and is free of contamination by other viruses and mycoplasmas. Three cell lines, which originated from a sheep, goat and bat, were infected with MVV and passaged approximately every 5 days. The cultured cells were then subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis for MVV provirus. As a result, a cell line persistently infected with MVV was established from ZZ-R cells, which originated from the fetal goat tongue. The 50-fold concentrated culture fluid formed a precipitation line against reference antiserum.","Retroviridae that mainly affects domestic sheep [11, 14] . Infected sheep develop fatal and progressive pneumonia and encephalomyelitis after a latent period of several months to years. Most MVVinfected sheep are asymptomatic but produce a specific antibody that persists for life [11, 13] . Therefore, effective and practical sero-diagnostic tests for identification of infected animals are needed for serological surveys. ELISA and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests have been used for the antibody survey [4] , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been employed for pathogen detection [1] . SCP cells, which originate from the sheep brain choroid plexus (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] No. CRL-1700), have been reported to be an MVV-sensitive cell line [15] but contaminated with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [2] . MVV infection is recognized worldwide [16] , but the prevalence of the disease has been unknown in Japan. A recent serological survey revealed that there were seropositive sheep in Hokkaido and Iwate Prefectures according to a test for the MVV antigen [5] , and MVV was isolated from one of the seropositive sheep in Iwate Prefecture [12] . Using this isolate, we attempted to prepare a cell line that is persistently infected with MVV without contamination by other viruses and mycoplasmas."
Gene expression Improved quality control processing of peptide-centric LC-MS proteomics data,"In the analysis of differential peptide peak intensities (i.e. abundance measures), LC-MS analyses with poor quality peptide abundance data can bias downstream statistical analyses and hence the biological interpretation for an otherwise high-quality dataset. Although considerable effort has been placed on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing, to date quality assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation or individual peptide components. Identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics data as many of the downstream statistical analyses [e.g. analysis of variance (ANOVA)] rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and their results are influenced by extreme values. Results: We describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the identification of LC-MS runs with extreme peptide abundance distributions. Comparison with current method (runby-run correlation) demonstrates a significantly better rate of identification of outlier runs by the multivariate strategy. Simulation studies also suggest that this strategy significantly outperforms correlation alone in the identification of statistically extreme liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runs.","The majority of statistical strategies to assess peptide/protein differential abundances from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic experiments are based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) methodologies applied to peak intensities (i.e. abundance measures) of proteolytic peptides (Bukhman et al., 2008; Daly et al., 2008; Karpievitch et al., 2009; Oberg and Vitek, 2009; Oberg et al., 2008) . However, * To whom correspondence should be addressed. the ANOVA approach relies upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and proteomics studies not only have inherent variability associated with the biological samples, but potentially diverse process-based sources of variability. That is, the accurate estimate of sample variances is often difficult to obtain. For example, sample preparation protocols and instrument variations associated with the LC column (particularly important for multi-column platforms) and mass spectrometer can cause variations in peak intensities, as well as peptides identified across MS analyses within an experiment. Data quality is especially important when the number of biological samples is small, often the case in proteomics experiments, and extreme values can negatively influence all subsequent data analysis outcomes."
G-quadruplex-interacting compounds alter latent DNA replication and episomal persistence of KSHV,"KSHV achieves this by tethering its epigenome to the host chromosome by latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which binds in the terminal repeat (TR) region of the viral genome. Sequence analysis of the TR, a GC-rich DNA element, identified several potential Quadruplex G-Rich Sequences (QGRS). Since quadruplexes have the tendency to obstruct DNA replication, we used G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds to examine their effect on latent DNA replication and the persistence of viral episomes. Our results showed that these G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds led to the activation of dormant origins of DNA replication, with preferential bidirectional pausing of replications forks moving out of the TR region, implicating the role of the G-rich TR in the perturbation of episomal DNA replication. Over time, treatment with PhenDC3 showed a loss of viral episomes in the infected cells. Overall, these data show that G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds retard the progression of replication forks leading to a reduction in DNA replication and episomal maintenance. These results suggest a potential role for G-quadruplex stabilizers in the treatment of KSHVassociated diseases.","Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human gamma herpesvirus that has been implicated in several lymphoproliferative diseases and is responsible for AIDS associated morbidities and mortalities (1) (2) (3) . KSHV establishes a life-long latent infection preferentially in Blymphocytes, where the genome is maintained as a multicopy, chromatinized episome tethered to the host chromosome through the interaction of the viral protein, Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen (LANA) (4) (5) (6) (7) . To stably maintain the latent infection in proliferating B cells, the KSHV genome needs to be replicated and faithfully segregated during each cellular division. The terminal repeat (TR) region of KSHV contains a primary origin of latent DNA replication of KSHV and is critical for the stable maintenance of the viral episome in proliferating cells (8) (9) (10) . Apart from LANA, the KSHV TR associates with several components of the cellular replication machinery, including origin recognition complexes (ORCs), mini chromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs), Topoisomerase II␤ (TOPOII␤) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Recruitment of TOPOII␤ by LANA is essential for the initiation of replication in the TRs and the maintenance of the KSHV episome (13) . Recent studies showed that TR-mediated DNA replication is coupled with DNA recombination and the depletion of cellular replication fork protection factors, such as Timeless and Tipin, reduce the genome copies of latently persisting KSHV (15) confirming an important role of replication fork progression in viral DNA replication."
Mycoplasma pneumoniae- associated transverse myelitis presenting as asymmetric flaccid paralysis,"Acute transverse myelitis is a rare spinal cord inflammatory disorder that manifests as sudden onset of motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunctions. Here, we report a case of acute transverse myelitis in a 13year-old boy secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. He presented with left facial palsy and contralateral upper extremity weakness without sensory or autonomic changes. The patient was diagnosed with transverse myelitis based on his magnetic resonance imaging findings, although his presentation was mainly motor dysfunction, which is more consistent with acute flaccid paralysis.","and brachioradialis, but normal on the left side. There was no sensory disturbance or numbness. There were no gait abnormalities and no bladder or bowel incontinence. The rest of his physical examination was normal. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild pleocytosis of 18/mm 3 with 76% lymphocytes and 22% monocytes. CSF protein 52 mg/dL, and glucose 61 mg/dL. Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and cervical spine revealed cord swelling with T2 prolongation and without contrast enhancement extending from the brain stem at the level of middle cerebellar peduncles through the medulla and the cervical spinal cord to the C7 level. No other area of abnormal signal was present (Figures 1 and 2) . These findings are most consistent with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) due to involvement of ≥3 vertebral segments."
Impact of a porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreak on swine productivity in Japan: a retrospective cohort study,"The objective was to investigate porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreak that occurred in 2014 in Japan and its effects on herdlevel productivity using a data recording system (PigINFO). The study herds were selected from farrow-to-finish herds (n=99) that entered in the PigINFO (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on polymerase chain reaction analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining were defined as PED-positive (n=38). They were further classified into those with long PED periods (L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with short PED periods (S-PED-positive; n=10). Herds with no clinical signs of PED were classified as PED-negative (n=61). Herdlevel production data, including preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter, litters per mated female per year and pigs marketed per sow (MP), were calculated every 3 months during study period. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than PED-negative herds, and L-PEDpositive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL. During October-December 2014, L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than PED-negative herds. The PED outbreak increased mortality and consequently reduced the numbers of marketed pigs. The rapid control of an outbreak is important for reducing the financial losses arising from PED infections.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1971 [16] . The clinical signs of PED are acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in significant economic losses [5] . Outbreaks of PED continued in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s [5] . In October 2010, a severe outbreak of PED occurred in >10 provinces in southern China, and >1,000,000 piglets died [13] . PED outbreaks were subsequently reported in other Asian countries, including Korea [6] , Taiwan [7] and Thailand [11] , and were then reported in European countries, including Germany in 2014 [4] and Belgium in 2015 [15] . PED was identified in the United States for the first time in May 2013 [12] and spread rapidly to approximately 50% of the US swine breeding herds from July 2013 to July 2014 [3] . The PED isolates collected in the United States were genetically similar to those obtained in Asian [2, 6, 7, 10] and European countries [4, 15] , indicating potential trans-continental transmission."
,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalization, and morbidity among children worldwide. This study aimed to assess the viral and bacterial causes of ARI morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years in Senegal. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children under 5 years who had ARI. Viruses and bacteria were identified using multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and conventional biochemical techniques, respectively. Adenovirus was the most prevalent virus (50%; n = 81), followed by influenza virus (45.68%, n = 74), rhinovirus (40.12%; n = 65), enterovirus (25.31%; n = 41), and respiratory syncytial virus (16.05%; n = 26), whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae (17%; n = 29), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.43%; n = 25), and Haemophilus influenzae (8.02%; n = 13) were the most commonly isolated bacteria. Virus pathogens seem more likely to be more prevalent in our settings and were often associated with bacteria and S. pneumoniae (6%; 16) coinfection.","Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as acute otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality among children worldwide, particularly in low-income countries. 1 According to World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of hospitalized children under 5 years with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) is estimated to be 20% and 90% of those were due to pneumonia. 2 In addition, the number of childhood deaths annually related to ARIs is very important and is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2 million, and 70% of the deaths took place in Africa and Southeast Asia which are the most. 1, 3 Bacteria and viruses have been reported as the main causes of ARIs. In children under 5 years, ARIs are caused mainly due to viruses; respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), parainfluenza viruses, influenza virus A and B, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are the most common viruses isolated. 4, 5 However, primary infections with viral pathogens can predispose to secondary bacterial infections, and the most frequently isolated bacteria in ARIs include Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae. 6 These bacteria were increasingly resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics for ARI treatment, 7 leading to increase in mortality rates, hospital durations, and health care-associated costs. 8 In resource-limited countries, bacteria have been the main cause of ARIs. This could be explained by the inaccessibility of molecular diagnostic tools thus leading to inadequate antibiotics prescription and consequently contributed to a rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance among bacteria causing RTIs. 9, 10 In Senegal, few studies on viral and bacterial etiologies of RTIs are available in pediatric settings. Respiratory tract infections are mainly empirically treated with antibiotics on a simple suspicion of bacterial infection. Indeed, this could be one of the major causes of high morbidity and mortality rates."
Memory immune responses and protection of chickens against a nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus strain by combining live heterologous and inactivated homologous vaccines,"In this study, we evaluated antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments and protection against challenge with a nephropathogenic Brazilian (BR-I) strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chickens submitted to a vaccination regime comprising a priming dose of heterologous live attenuated Massachusetts vaccine followed by a booster dose of an experimental homologous inactivated vaccine two weeks later. This immunization protocol elicited significant increases in serum and lachrymal levels of anti-IBV IgG antibodies and upregulated the expression of CMI response genes, such as those encoding CD8β chain and Granzyme homolog A in tracheal and kidney tissues at 3, 7, and 11 days post-infection in the vaccinated chickens. Additionally, vaccinated and challenged chickens showed reduced viral loads and microscopic lesion counts in tracheal and kidney tissues, and their antibody and CMI responses were negatively correlated with viral loads in the trachea and kidney. In conclusion, the combination of live attenuated vaccine containing the Massachusetts strain with a booster dose of an inactivated vaccine, containing a BR-I IBV strain, confers effective protection against infection with nephropathogenic homologous IBV strain because of the induction of consistent memory immune responses mediated by IgG antibodies and TCD8 cells in the mucosal and systemic compartments of chickens submitted to this vaccination regime.","ABSTRACT.

Potential implication of new torque teno mini viruses in parapneumonic empyema in children,An unexplained increase in the incidence of parapneumonic empyema (PPE) in pneumonia cases has been reported in recent years. The present study investigated the genetic and biological specifications of new isolates of torque teno mini virus (TTMV) detected in pleural effusion samples from children hospitalised for severe pneumonia with PPE.,"About 1.8 million children aged ,5 years die from pneumonia every year [1] . A wide range of pathogens are recognised as causative agents of pneumonia, but 14-23% of cases remain aetiologically undiagnosed, despite continuing optimisation of diagnostic tests for the detection of respiratory pathogens [2, 3] . Different methods have been developed for the identification of unsuspected, new and divergent pathogens. In recent years, these techniques have led to the discovery of several viruses in respiratory specimens, including human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses, and torque teno virus (TTV) [4] . Some of these have been confirmed subsequently as causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), but the involvement of most of these viruses remains a widely debated issue. TTV belongs to the recently created viral family Anelloviridae, composed of single-stranded circular DNA viruses, such as TTV (Alphatorquevirus), torque teno midi virus (Gammatorquevirus) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) (Betatorquevirus) [5] ."
A questionnaire-based survey on the uptake and use of cattle vaccines in the UK,"To cite: Cresswell E, et al. A questionnaire-based survey on the uptake and use of cattle vaccines in the UK. Vet ABSTRACT Background: Vaccination is a widely used strategy for disease control in cattle in the UK and abroad. However, there has been limited research describing the uptake and use of cattle vaccines on UK farms. Aim: To describe the current uptake and usage of cattle vaccines in the UK.","Vaccines have been used in veterinary medicine since the inoculation of lambs with sheep pox in the 16th century (McVey and Shi 2010) . The administration of vaccines is now commonplace and is considered one of the most important aspects of global disease control (Tizard 2009 ). Strategic implementation of vaccination is important to cattle health and welfare, as vaccination can help to control and eradicate disease, as demonstrated by the global eradication of rinderpest (Normile 2008) , and control of rabies, foot and mouth disease and swine erysipelas (Lombard and others 2007) . In order for disease control to be effectively achieved via vaccination, correct usage is required, which includes administering vaccines via the correct route, at the appropriate time and to a specified target group of animals (Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance (RUMA) 2012). Incorrect administration may lead to breakthrough disease, rendering vaccination a wasteful, rather than beneficial exercise (Salisbury and others 2006) ."
Comparison of cytokine expression profiles in infants with a rhinovirus induced lower respira tory tract infection with or without wheez ing: a comparison with respiratory syn cytial virus,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether infants with rhinovirus (RV) infection-induced wheezing and those with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection-induced wheezing have different cytokine profiles in the acute stage. Methods: Of the infants with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) between September 2011 and May 2012, 88 were confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and hospitalized. Systemic interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Treg-type cytokine (IL-10) responses were examined with multiplex assay using acute phase serum samples. Results: Of the 88 patients, 38 had an RV infection (RV group) and 50 had an RSV infection (RSV group). In the RV group, the IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations were higher in the patients with than in the patients without wheezing (P=0.022 and P=0.007, respectively). In the RSV group, the differences in IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations did not reach statistical significance between the patients with and the patients without wheezing (P=0.105 and P=0.965, respectively). The IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly different between the RV group with wheezing and the RSV group with wheezing (P=0.155 and P=0.801, respectively), in contrast to the significant difference between the RV group without wheezing and the RSV group without wheezing (P=0.019 and P=0.035, respectively). Conclusion: In comparison with RSV-induced LRTI, RV-induced LRTI combined with wheezing showed similar IFN-γ and IL-10 levels, which may have an important regulatory function.","The most common upper respiratory tract infection in infants and children is infection by rhinovirus (RV) 1) . Classically, the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which sometimes causes a severe LRTI, and as such, many infants with RSV infection require hospitalization 2, 3) . Recent studies have demonstrated that the RV is also an important cause of LRTI in infants 4, 5) . Although some reports have described the importance of the RV in causing an LRTI 2, [4] [5] [6] , the data pertaining to the clinical significance of RV infections in infants are inconsistent. Some studies presented the evidences that RV is the main organism in 21% and 29% of infants with bronchiolitis, and other studies concluded that RV respiratory infection was not significantly associated with any age group."
A Single Native Ganglioside GM 1 -Binding Site Is Sufficient for Cholera Toxin To Bind to Cells and Complete the Intoxication Pathway,"Cholera toxin (CT) from Vibrio cholerae is responsible for the majority of the symptoms of the diarrheal disease cholera. CT is a heterohexameric protein complex with a 240-residue A subunit and a pentameric B subunit of identical 103-residue B polypeptides. The A subunit is proteolytically cleaved within a disulfide-linked loop to generate the A1 and A2 fragments. The B subunit of wild-type (wt) CT binds 5 cell surface ganglioside GM 1 (GM 1 ) molecules, and the toxin-GM 1 complex traffics from the plasma membrane (PM) retrograde through endosomes and the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, the enzymatic A1 fragment retrotranslocates to the cytosol to cause disease. Clustering of GM 1 by multivalent toxin binding can structurally remodel cell membranes in ways that may assist toxin uptake and retrograde trafficking. We have recently found, however, that CT may traffic from the PM to the ER by exploiting an endogenous glycosphingolipid pathway (A. A. Wolf et al., Infect. Immun. 76:1476 -1484, 2008, and D. J. F. Chinnapen et al., Dev. Cell 23:573-586, 2012)","dation by the proteasome due to the paucity of lysine residues in its structure. It then forms an allosterically activated complex by binding to an ADP ribosylation factor (ARF), and it ADP ribosylates the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein, leading to constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase. In the human intestinal cell line T84, an increased concentration of cyclic AMP elicits a Clsecretory response which can be measured electrophysiologically in real time as a change in short circuit current, I sc (11) ."
Differences between asthmatics and nonasthmatics hospitalised with influenza A infection,Asthmatics hospitalised because of influenza A infection are less likely to require intensive care or die compared with nonasthmatics. The reasons for this are unknown.,"V iral respiratory tract infections are the commonest cause of exacerbations of asthma, being implicated in ,80% of exacerbations in children and 50% of exacerbations in adults [1] [2] [3] . The most commonly identified virus associated with exacerbations of asthma is rhinovirus, followed by coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus [1, 4] ."
Adenoviral vector-based strategies against infectious disease and cancer,"Adenoviral vectors are widely employed against infectious diseases or cancers, as they can elicit specific antibody responses and T cell responses when they are armed with foreign genes as vaccine carriers, and induce apoptosis of the cancer cells when they are genetically modified for cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics of adenovirus (Ad) and the latest development of Ad vectorbased strategies for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases or cancers. Strategies to circumvent the pre-existing neutralizing antibodies which dampen the immunogenicity of Ad-based vaccines are also discussed.","Ad is non-enveloped, double stranded DNA virus with icosahedral capsids. It was first discovered by Rowe and his colleagues when they tried to culture the adenoid tissue in the laboratory in 1953. Ad infection is usually mild to human beings, but sometimes could be life threatening, especially to the immunocompromised individuals. In the 1970s, the United States army developed live Ad vaccines to prevent acute respiratory disease caused by AdHu4 and AdHu7. 1 In 1991, Rosenfeld et al developed the first in vivo gene transfer using an Ad vector, and demonstrated that human a 1-antitrypsin gene delivered by the E1-E3-deleted Ad could be detected in the lung of a cotton rat. 2 In 1993, the first human gene therapy study based on Ads was performed, a 23-year-old man with cystic fibrosis homozygous received the first in vivo gene therapy with administration of an E1-E3-deleted rAd vector expressing the normal human CFTR, and the subsequent clinical studies were then initiated. In recent two decades, Ads have been widely applied as vaccine carriers since they are capable of eliciting T and B cell responses. Furthermore, Ads can be genetically modified to induce the apoptosis of the cancer cells, which are known as the oncolytic Ads. 3, 4 Ads are not only generally safe and can replicate in almost all the living cells, but also can be expanded easily in HEK293 cells and purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifuge, and administered through oral, intranasal or intramuscular routes without adjuvants. Here, we review the Ads' potential in vaccine development against infectious pathogens or in cancer treatment, and address the latest advances in the field."
-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/),"The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th e 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.","The ongoing epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily affecting mainland China and can be traced back to a cluster of severe pneumonia cases identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 World Health Organization, 2020) . Early cases of the disease have been linked to a live animal seafood market in Wuhan, pointing to a zoonotic origin of the epidemic. However, human-to-human transmission has driven its rapid spread with a total of 37,289 confirmed cases, including 813 deaths, in China and 302 confirmed cases imported in multiple countries as of February 9, 2020 (Chinese National Health Committee). While the early transmission potential of this novel coronavirus appeared similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Riou & Althaus, 2020) , the current tally of the epidemic has already surpassed the total cases reported for the SARS outbreaks in 2002e2003 (W. World Health Organization, 2003; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) ."
Tackling the Global Challenge: Humanitarian Catastrophes,"Humanitarian catastrophes,"" conflicts and calamities generating both widespread human suffering and destructive events, require a wide range of emergency resources. This paper answers a number of questions that humanitarian catastrophes generate: Why and how do the most-developed countries-those with the resources, capabilities, and willingness to help-intervene in specific types of disasters? What ethical and legal guidelines shape our interventions? How well do we achieve our goals? It then suggests a number of changes to improve humanitarian responses, including better NGO-government cooperation, increased research on the best disaster response methods, clarification of the criteria and roles for humanitarian (military) interventions, and development of post-2015 Millennium Development Goals with more accurate progress measures. [West J Emerg Med. 2014;15(2):231-240.]","The phrase ""humanitarian catastrophes"" describes conflicts and calamities that generate both widespread human suffering and destructive events that require a wide range of emergency resources. These catastrophes, which occur with intimidating frequency, present both as acute crises and as chronic or cyclical disasters, each with different etiologies and responses. In both acute and chronic crises, external assistance generally originates from the most-developed countriesthose with the resources, capabilities, and willingness to help. This paper describes what various acute and chronic crises entail and answers the following questions:"
The Journal of Infectious Diseases Evidence for Cross-Protection Against Subsequent Febrile Respiratory Illness Episodes From Prior Infections by Different Viruses Among Singapore Military Recruits,Background. Few studies have evaluated the relative cross-protection conferred by infection with different groups of viruses through studies of sequential infections in humans. We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI).,"Viral interference describes the phenomenon whereby a prior viral infection potentially exerts some effect on subsequent infection with other viruses [1] . Edward Jenner first reported this when herpetic infections were observed to cross-protect against the subsequent development of vaccinia lesions [2] . Then, in the 1950s, Isaacs and Lindenmann discovered the role of interferons in viral interference [3] . Since then, cross-protection has been observed for animal viruses [2] , with possible mechanisms elaborated on in multiple animal models [4] [5] [6] . In human populations, time-series analyses have demonstrated how epidemics involving a particular virus influence the temporality of epidemics involving other families of respiratory viruses [7] [8] [9] [10] . Several case-control and cross-sectional studies also show that co-detection of respiratory viruses is less frequently observed than if the infections caused by different respiratory viruses occur independently of each other [11] [12] [13] . However, evidence from studies of sequential infections in humans would provide more-robust evidence that viral infections can reduce the risk of subsequent infection with a different group of viruses and clarify whether such cross-protective effects differ between different types of viruses."
Applications of gold nanoparticles in virus detection,"Viruses are the smallest known microbes, yet they cause the most significant losses in human health. Most of the time, the best-known cure for viruses is the innate immunological defense system of the host; otherwise, the initial prevention of viral infection is the only alternative. Therefore, diagnosis is the primary strategy toward the overarching goal of virus control and elimination. The introduction of a new class of nanoscale materials with multiple unique properties and functions has sparked a series of breakthrough applications. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely reported to guide an impressive resurgence in biomedical and diagnostic applications. Here, we review the applications of AuNPs in virus testing and detection. The developed AuNP-based detection techniques are reported for various groups of clinically relevant viruses with a special focus on the applied types of bio-AuNP hybrid structures, virus detection targets, and assay modalities and formats. We pay particular attention to highlighting the functional role and activity of each core Au nanostructure and the resultant detection improvements in terms of sensitivity, detection range, and time. In addition, we provide a general summary of the contributions of AuNPs to the mainstream methods of virus detection, technical measures, and recommendations required in guidance toward commercial in-field applications.","Viruses are remarkable pathogens that are causing prominently increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Their highly contagious nature and the absence of immediate and efficient control systems are the main reasons behind their potential health impacts. Currently, viral infections and associated diseases are major causes of death in mankind, and under the present context of industrialization and immigration, they continue to emerge at a rapid pace, causing significant human, social, and financial costs [1] . Additionally, gaps in currently applied detection systems potentially contribute to increasing the likelihood of international incidences and outbreak of viral infections [2] [3] [4] [5] . The implementation of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools has the potential to rapidly identify viral infections, initiate and guide judicious controls, and subsequently curtail their dissemination. Toward this endeavor and beyond the pitfalls of current immunological and molecular techniques commonly applied to virus detection, several new approaches based on nanoparticles (NPs) have recently been developed. AuNPs are widely described to be suitable for numerous biosensing functions and applications. Their unique photonic, electric, and catalytic properties, coupled with the molecular interaction specificity of various biomolecules (e.g., antibodies, single-stranded (ss) DNA, and RNA aptamers, among others), represent the design principles of a wide range of virus detection systems [6] [7] [8] . The advantages of being simple, rapid, and sensitive and facilitating quantitative detection with excellent multiplexing capabilities have greatly promoted these systems to be envisioned as state-of-the-art technologies for virus Ivyspring International Publisher detection [9, 10] . However, there are no available reviews of the applications of bio-AuNP hybrid structures for sensing and detecting viruses. In this article, we provide a current review of AuNP-based virus detection at the level of virus type, including the types and structures of the applied AuNPs. We highlight their role in enhancing sensory and detection performance in comparison with current techniques in terms of analytical sensitivity, detection range, and time. Furthermore, this review specifically summarizes detection designs, formats, functions, and contributions, which are of special importance to both scientific and applied research."
The Amino-Terminal Domain of the Lamin B Receptor Is a Nuclear Envelope Targeting Signal,"The lamin B receptor (LBR) is a polytopic 1. Abbreviations used/n th/spaper: LBR, lamin B receptor; NLS, nuclear localization signal.","protein of the inner nuclear membrane. It is synthesized without a cleavable amino-terminal signal sequence and composed of a nucleoplasmic aminoterminal domain of 204 amino acids followed by a hydrophobic domain with eight putative transmembrane segments. To identify a nuclear envelope targeting signal, we have examined the cellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy of chicken LBR, its amino-terminal domain and chimeric proteins transiently expressed in transfected COS-7. Full-length LBR was targeted to the nuclear envelope. The aminoterminal domain, without any transmembrane segments, was transported to the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus. When the amino-terminal domain of LBR was fused to the amino-terminal side of a transmembrane segment of a type II integral membrane protein of the ER/plasma membrane, the chimeric protein was targeted to the nuclear envelope, likely the inner nuclear membrane. When the aminoterminal domain was deleted from LBR and replaced by ot-globin, the chimeric protein was retained in the ER. These findings demonstrate that the aminoterminal domain of LBR is targeted to the nucleus after synthesis in the cytoplasm and that this polypeptide can function as a nuclear envelope targeting signal when located at the amino terminus of a type II integral membrane protein synthesized on the ER. T HE topology of integral membrane proteins synthesized on the ER is established by signal and stop transfer sequences that determine which domains traverse aqueous pores in the ER membrane and which domains remain localiT~d in the membrane (Blobel, 1980; Simon and Blobel, 1991) . Some of these proteins contain specific sequences that confer retention in the ER (Paabo et al., 1987; Nilsson et al., 1989; Jackson et ai., 1990) . Others are targeted to the cis-C-olgi network by ER-derived membrane vesicles, and some of these integral membrane proteins contain sequences that confer retention in the Golgi membranes (lVlachamer and Rose, 1987; Nilsson et al., 1991; Wong et al., 1992) . Most integral membrane proteins that reach the Golgi complex are sorted into different populations of membrane vesicles that emerge from the TGN to become secretory storage vesicles or to fuse with lysosomes or the plasma membrane (Grifiiths and Simons, 1986; Klausner, 1989; Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Rothman and Orci, 1992) . In epithelial cells, additional sorting mechanisms are operative that target protein-containing membrane vesicles to either the apical or basolateral membranes (Rodriguez-Boulan and Nelson, 1989) ."
Evaluation of an Immunochromatographic Assay for the Rapid and Simultaneous Detection of Rotavirus and Adenovirus in Stool Samples,"Background: We evaluated the analytical and clinical performances of the SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit (SD Rota/Adeno Rapid; Standard Diagnostics, Inc., Korea), an immunochromatographic assay (ICA), for the simultaneous detection of rotaviruses and adenoviruses in human stool samples.","Rotaviruses and adenoviruses are the main causes of severe infectious diarrhea, especially in children under 5 yr of age. They are also responsible for nosocomial infection through fecal to oral transmission [1, 2] . Rotaviruses are the primary cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children during winter months [2, 3] . Among the 7 rotavirus serogroups (A-G), group A rotaviruses are the principal cause of human infections [2, 3] ."
Interaction of the HIV-1 frameshift signal with the ribosome,"Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs relies on the mechanical properties of structural elements, often pseudoknots and more rarely stem-loops, that are unfolded by the ribosome during translation. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5 0 direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8 AE 1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.","The ribosome translocates mRNA and bound tRNA molecules accurately in order to maintain the reading frame. This process results in movement of the ribosome along the mRNA by three nucleotides toward the mRNA's 3 0 -end. Translocation of mRNA and tRNAs is a property of the ribosome itself (1, 2) , however binding of elongation factor G (EF-G) and subsequent hydrolysis of GTP strongly catalyzes it (3) . Although the ribosome acts as its own helicase, stable folded structures within the coding regions of mRNA affect the rate of translocation, and more seriously, may trigger a change of reading frame (4, 5) . Such frameshifting mRNA elements play a crucial role in the translational control of viral proteins via -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) where the reading frame has shifted by one base toward the mRNA 5 0 -end. The -1 PRF requires both the mRNA slippery sequence at the ribosome coding sites as well as a downstream structural element that resists unfolding, representing a physical barrier to the mRNA translocation machinery. While in many cases the downstream barrier constitutes a hairpin (H)-type pseudoknots (6, 7) , on a rare occasion it can also be a simple stem-loop structure (8) (9) (10) (11) . It is of interest to note that although these pseudoknots or stem-loops also trigger ribosomal pausing at the slippery site, consistent with notion of them acting as physical barriers, the extent of pausing shows no correlation with frameshift efficiency (12) ."
Recent Advances Towards the Development of a Potent Antiviral Against the Hepatitis E Virus,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the leading causes of acute viral hepatitis. It also causes acute liver failure and acute-onchronic liver failure in many patients, such as those suffering from other infections/ liver injuries or organ transplant/chemotherapy recipients. Despite widespread sporadic and epidemic incidents, there is no specific treatment against HEV, justifying an urgent need for developing a potent antiviral against it. This review summarizes the known antiviral candidates and provides an overview of the potential targets for the development of specific antivirals against HEV. Citation of this article: Anang S, Kaushik N, Surjit M. Recent advances towards the development of a potent antiviral against the hepatitis E virus.","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus that causes acute and chronic viral hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver failure in infected individuals. 1 It is known to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, transfusion of infected blood products or through the vertical route. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Zoonotic transmission due to consumption of infected meat products, resulting in sporadic cases, is particularly frequent in developed countries. 8 The disease symptoms include jaundice, nausea, vomiting, fever and sore muscles. Though the infection is acute in normal individuals, it becomes chronic in immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients, individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, and patients undergoing chemotherapy. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The disease worsens in pregnancy, with mortality rates reaching as high as 20 to 25%. 6, 15, 16 Recent reports have described extra-hepatic manifestations, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, neurological amyotrophy, arthritis, pancreatitis and glomerulonephritis, in several HEV infected patients.

Clinical Infectious Diseases Malaria Coinfections in Febrile Pediatric Inpatients: A Hospital-Based Study From Ghana,"Background. The epidemiology of pediatric febrile illness is shifting in sub-Saharan Africa, but malaria remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. The present study describes causes of febrile illness in hospitalized children in Ghana and aims to determine the burden of malaria coinfections and their association with parasite densities.","In recent years, studies on causes of nonmalarial fever (NMF) in developing countries revealed a broad spectrum of potentially causative pathogens [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Many of these studies were conducted in the East African region, where a substantial drop in malaria prevalence could be observed [6] . Instead, acute respiratory tract infections of viral origin have been identified as one of the main causes of fever in pediatric outpatients [2] . However, such a remarkable decrease of malaria incidences has never been reported in Western and Central African regions, where Plasmodium falciparum infections are still frequent [7] ."
"Original Article Clinical Chemistry Proenkephalin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin, and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates in Patients With Sepsis",Background: Proenkephalin (PENK) has been suggested as a novel biomarker for kidney function. We investigated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of plasma PENK in comparison with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) in septic patients.,"Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Even a modest degree of organ dysfunction may lead to the further deterioration of septic patients and an overall mortality of approximately 10%; thus, early recognition merits a prompt and appropriate intervention [1] . Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is a potentially life-threatening factor associated with significant morbidity and mortality [2, 3] . Sepsis is the most common precipitating factor in the development of AKI, and sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) is often more acute and severe compared with AKI without sepsis, posing significant clinical challenges [4, 5] ."
H1N1 influenza pandemic in Italy revisited: has the willingness to get vaccinated suffered in the long run?,Background. The aim of the study is to assess the long-term secondary effects of personal experience with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/2010 and the perception of the institutional reaction to it on Italians' willingness to get vaccinated in case of a novel influenza pandemic.,"Influenza is an annually recurring, contagious viral respiratory infection that usually hits countries with temperate climate during the winter season. 1 An influenza infection poses a serious health threat especially to known risk groups such as elderly people and pregnant women. But also the large number of mild to moderate infections cause remarkable economic costs and have a direct impact on the affected peoples' daily life. 1 However, due to different, incomplete or unreliable reporting, the true morbidity and premature mortality caused by influenza epidemics is hard to assess. 2 The prediction of the medical and economic consequences of an influenza pandemic is even more difficult as the level of uncertainty is higher. There are various effective possibilities to prevent an influenza infection such as regular hand washing, the avoidance of larger gatherings of people or air travelling. The most effective prevention tool is, however, vaccination. 1, 3 Although seasonal influenza clearly depicts a burden for a country's health care system it is still relatively well manageable as the time of occurrence is foreseeable and the consequences calculable. Pandemic influenza, in contrast, happens rarely but has the potential to cause considerable damage on a national and global level. That is because of several differences between seasonal and pandemic influenza: Since the latter one only spreads a couple of times during a century most people have little or no immunity against the virus due to the missing previous exposure, whereas most people have at least some immunity against the seasonal influenza virus. 4 Moreover, pandemic influenza cannot only lead to severe complications for at high risk populations such as elderly or people with a weak immune system but also for healthy adults. 4 Due to the rapid spread of pandemic influenza, which has become even faster because of the increased rate of air travelling nowadays, countries have only little time to get prepared for the high number of cases which might likely lead to an overwhelming of their health care system. While there is mostly an effective flu vaccine against the seasonal influenza available, the strain of a pandemic influenza cannot be foreseen. Thus, it takes some time to develop a vaccine and in the meantime health authorities have to rely on nonpharmaceutical preventive measures which results in a longer timeperiod needed for the virus's containment. The combination of these factors and a usually high number of cases further causes considerable public concern -often heated up by intense media coverage. Thus, the management of pandemic influenza represents a high challenge for governments and health authorities and calls for a solid preparedness plan in order to meet the needs of the population."
The Functional Properties of Preserved Eggs: From Anti-cancer and Anti-inflammatory Aspects,"Preserved egg, a kind of alkaline-fermented food, is a traditional egg product in China. Here, we investigated the nutritional functions of preserved eggs by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results of in vivo studies showed that the levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) were significantly decreased (p<0.05) in the liver of rats treated with preserved eggs. Meanwhile, the levels of two important cancer markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were also significantly decreased (p<0.05) in treated rats. In vitro studies were performed on Caco-2 cells, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. It demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) digests of preserved eggs significantly accelerated (p<0.05) the apoptosis by upregulating caspase-3 in the Caco-2 cells. Besides, after treated with preserved eggs, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of preserved eggs digests to Caco-2 cells was 5.75 mg/mL, indicating the significant inhibition of cell proliferation provided by preserved eggs (p<0.05). The results shown in this study demonstrated that preserved eggs may be a novel functional food involved with antilipemic, anti-inflammatory activity as well as the effect on accelarating the apoptosis of Caco-2 cells.","inhibit the growth and invasion of tumor cell in vitro (Corder et al., 2001) . Studies have shown that preserved egg white hydrolysates show anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo experiments and can significantly decrease the expression levels of IL-8 and TNF-α (Zhao et al., 2017) . In addition, ACE-inhibitory peptides isolated from preserved eggs proved their antioxidant activity in vitro (Yang, 2016) . Numerous studies have indicated that alkaline foods, such as kelp (Yuan and Walsh, 2006) , grape (Renaud and De, 1992) , and bitter gourd (Rajasekhar et al., 2012) , can inhibit the growth of various human cancer cell lines. The results showed that the algae polyphenols extracted from kelp can inhibit the rancidity of fish oil and the antioxidant efficiency was 2.6-fold higher than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Yan et al., 1996) . Researchers found that seaweed polyphenols can significantly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and the inhibition effect was linearly correlated to the total level of phenol in seaweed (Yuan and Walsh, 2006) . Resveratrol in grapes was shown to have inhibitory effects on cancer cell initiation, proliferation and development (Corder et al., 2001) ."
Analysis of mortality prognostic factors using model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium classification for liver cirrhosis complications A retrospective cohort study,"Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancement of the quality of life and expectation of life in patients. The use of model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) with physiological indicators can be used to assess severity and differentiate therapeutic interventions.","Liver cirrhosis is the end-stage of chronic liver disease, and with the progress of liver cirrhosis, hepatocyte necrosis is presented widely, as well as fibrosis, which destroys the normal structure of the liver. [1] Liver cirrhosis ranks as the 14th leading cause of mortality in adults in the world and in Korea, liver diseases rank as the 8th leading cause of mortality, accounting for 13.3 deaths per 100,000. [2, 3] The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates of patients with cirrhosis are 68%, 57%, and 43%, respectively. Liver cirrhosis is one of the major diseases leading to mortality in Korea in which the incidence rate of hepatitis B is high. [4] There are a variety of causes, including chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, consumption of a large amount of alcohol, and autoimmunity, while hepatitis B is the most common, with 48% to 70% of cases. [5] Depending on the presence of complications in the progress of liver cirrhosis, it is classified into decompensated cirrhosis, with complications, and compensated cirrhosis, without complications. [6] The progress rate of compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is approximately 58% and once it progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, its mortality rate within 5 years becomes 85% without liver transplantation. [7] Complications could cause a high difference in the progress of the disease. Most common complications are ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and varicose veins. [8] Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancing the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients. [7] With the recent diversification of chronic diseases, the incidence rate of complications has also risen; so, the management of complications has a higher influence over the quality of life. [7] [8] [9] Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that in patients with liver cirrhosis, the presence of complications and its treatment are critical factors for anticipating the degradation of the quality of life and the mortality."
Identification of an ideal adjuvant for receptor-binding domain-based subunit vaccines against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an emerging infectious disease caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has garnered worldwide attention as a consequence of its continuous spread and pandemic potential, making the development of effective vaccines a high priority. We previously demonstrated that residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing potent neutralization antibody responses. In this study, we sought to identify an adjuvant that optimally enhanced the immunogenicity of S377-588 protein fused with Fc of human IgG (S377-588-Fc). Specifically, we compared several commercially available adjuvants, including Freund's adjuvant, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and MF59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the immunogenicity of this subunit vaccine. In the absence of adjuvant, S377-588-Fc alone induced readily detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in immunized mice. However, incorporating an adjuvant improved its immunogenicity. Particularly, among the aforementioned adjuvants evaluated, MF59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and neutralizing antibodies. The addition of MF59 significantly augmented the immunogenicity of S377-588-Fc to induce strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses as well as protection against MERS-CoV infection in mice, suggesting that MF59 is an optimal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines.","A newly emerged infectious disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 1 and has now been reported in at least 20 countries in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and North America (http://www.cdc.gov/CORONAVIRUS/MERS/), raising worldwide concerns about its pandemic potential. By 26 December 2014, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the causative agent of MERS, had infected 941 people and caused at least 347 related deaths (mortality rate ,37%) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 26-december-2014-mers/en/). MERS-CoV utilizes bat and camels as natural reservoirs and intermediate transmission hosts, respectively. 2-6 MERS-CoV can spread through close contact or airborne transmission, causing serious public health problems. 7, 8 As such, the development of effective vaccination strategies to prevent MERS-CoV infection and disease is urgently needed. 9, 10 The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein plays important roles in virus attachment and subsequent entry into permissive cells expressing functional receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)). 11, 12 The receptor-binding domain (RBD), which resides within the S1 subunit of the S protein, mediates virus-receptor binding, thereby serving as an important target for vaccine development against MERS-CoV infection and disease. [13] [14] [15] Of the previously identified RBD-encoding residues which include residues 358-588, 367-588, 377-588 and 367-606, the fragment composed of 377-588 residues has been shown to contain critical neutralization epitopes. [13] [14] [15] [16] Specifically, we recently demonstrated that recombinant protein containing 377-588 residues fused with Fc of human IgG, designated S377-588-Fc, is particularly potent in eliciting neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits. 15, 17 Additionally, incubation of permissive Vero E6 cells with this recombinant protein effectively prevented MERS-CoV infection. 15 Together, these results suggest that the S377-588-Fc protein is an ideal subunit vaccine candidate worthy of further development as a MERS vaccine."
Distinct Molecular Mechanisms For Protein Sorting within Immature Secretory Granules of Pancreatic B-cells,"In the/S-cells of pancreatic islets, insulin is stored as the predominant protein within storage granules that undergo regulated exocytosis in response to glucose. By pulse-chase analysis of radiolabeled protein condensation in B-cells, the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein lags behind the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Condensation occurs within immature granules (IGs), accounting for passive protein sorting as demonstrated by constitutivelike secretion of newly synthesized C-peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat, R., and P. Arvan. J. Cell Biol. 1992. 118:521-529). Experimental manipulation of condensation conditions in vivo reveals a direct relationship between sorting of regulated secretory protein and polymer assembly within IGs. By contrast, entry from the trans-Golgi network into IGs does not appear especially selective for regulated secretory proteins. Specifically, in normal islets,","lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulusdependent secretory pathway with comparable efficiency to that of proinsulin. However, within 2 h after synthesis (the same period during which proinsulin processing occurs), newly synthesized hydrolases are fairly efficiently relocated out of the stimulusdependent pathway. In tunicamycin-treated islets, while entry of new lysosomal enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway continues unperturbed, exit of nonglycosylated hydrolases from this pathway does not occur. Consequently, the ultimate targeting of nonglycosylated hydrolases in/S-cells is to storage granules rather than lysosomes. These results implicate a post-Golgi mechanism for the active removal of lysosomal hydrolases away from condensed granule contents during the storage process for regulated secretory proteins. T HE past decade has witnessed considerable debate regarding the mechanism(s) used by specialized neuroendocrine and exocrine cells for sorting polypeptide hormones and other content proteins into storage (secretory) granules. Protein sorting during intracellular transport is well established for newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, which are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors and conveyed via clathrin-coated vesicles from the TGN to an endosomal compartment, en route to lysosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Trowbridge et al., 1993) . By analogy, the ""sorting for entry"" model of protein targeting to storage granules proposes that through specific mechanisms, regulated secretory proteins (and not other proteins) are selected from the mixed contents of the TGN (Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Orci et al., 1987a; Tooze et al., 1987a; Moore et al., 1989; Tooze and Huttner, 1990 ) and conveyed to immature granules (IGs) ~, the first organelle in the biosynthetic path-way able to undergo stimulus-dependent exocytosis (Arvan et al., 1991; Tooze et al., 1991b) . It has recently been recognized that regulated secretory protein condensation into insoluble aggregates plays a role in the sorting process (Gerdes et al., 1989; Wagner et al., 1991) . Consequently, Huttner and colleagues have hypothesized that sorting receptors in the TGN (Bauerfeind and Huttner, 1993) may direct selected protein aggregates (Chanat and Huttuer, 1991) from TGN to IGs, while denying similar access to nongranule content proteins."
"Emerging Microbes and Infections (2012) 1, e46","Emerging virus diseases are a major threat to human and veterinary public health. With new examples occurring approximately one each year, the majority are viruses originating from an animal host. Of the many factors responsible, changes to local ecosystems that perturb the balance between pathogen and principal host species is one of the major drivers, together with increasing urbanization of mankind and changes in human behavior. Many emerging viruses have RNA genomes and as such are capable of rapid mutation and selection of new variants in the face of environmental changes in host numbers and available target species. This review summarizes recent work on aspects of virus emergence and the current understanding of the molecular and immunological basis whereby viruses may cross between species and become established in new ecological niches. Emergence is hard to predict, although mathematical modeling and spatial epidemiology have done much to improve the prediction of where emergence may occur. However, much needs to be done to ensure adequate surveillance is maintained of animal species known to present the greatest risk thus increasing general alertness among physicians, veterinarians and those responsible for formulating public health policy.","Over the past two decades, there has been mounting interest in the increasing number of viruses causing unexpected illness and epidemics among humans, wildlife and livestock. All too often outbreaks have seriously stretched both local and national resources at a time when health-care spending in the economically developed world has been constrained. Importantly, capacity to identify and control emerging diseases remains limited in poorer regions where many of these diseases have their origin."
NOTE Antibody response to equine coronavirus in horses inoculated with a bovine coronavirus vaccine,"A vaccine for equine coronavirus (ECoV) is so far unavailable. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is antigenically related to ECoV; it is therefore possible that BCoV vaccine will induce antibodies against ECoV in horses. This study investigated antibody response to ECoV in horses inoculated with BCoV vaccine. Virus neutralization tests showed that antibody titers against ECoV increased in all six horses tested at 14 days post inoculation, although the antibody titers were lower against ECoV than against BCoV. This study showed that BCoV vaccine provides horses with antibodies against ECoV to some extent. It is unclear whether antibodies provided by BCoV vaccine are effective against ECoV, and therefore ECoV challenge studies are needed to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine in the future.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. first isolated in the United States in 1999 [4, 17] . Two-fold serial dilutions of serum were mixed with an equal volume of viral suspensions containing two hundred 50% tissue culture infective doses per 0.1 ml and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Then, 0.1 ml of each mixture was applied to HRT-18G cells on 96-well plates and incubated for 6 to 7 days. Virus-neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited viral cytopathic effects."
Evaluation of equine coronavirus fecal shedding among hospitalized horses,"Background: Currently, diagnosis of equine coronavirus (ECoV) relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease along with molecular detection of ECoV in feces or tissue.","Equine coronavirus (ECoV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a single-stranded, positive sense, enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus associated with outbreaks of enteric disease in adult horses. 1, 2 Infection with ECoV reportedly causes fever, lethargy, colic, or diarrhea of variable severity in adult horses. 1, 3 Hyperammonemic encephalopathy also has been reported. 3 Morbidity and mortality range from 10% to 83% [1] [2] [3] [4] and from 7% to 27%, [1] [2] [3] [4] respectively. Historically, electron microscopy (EM) was considered the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus in feces. 5, 6 Because of the expertise and equipment required for this technique and its inability to characterize viruses beyond the family level, EM has been augmented in clinical settings by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as this test provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool to document the presence of ECoV in feces of horses. 1 Epidemiological information regarding ECoV is limited, 7 and as a result, definitive diagnosis of ECoV in adult horses remains challenging."
Association of common comorbidities with osteonecrosis: a nationwide population-based case-control study in Denmark,"Objective To examine recent time trends in the incidence of osteonecrosis (ON) in Denmark and to investigate different common comorbidities association with ON in a population-based setting. Methods Using Danish medical databases, we included all patients with a first-time hospital diagnosis of ON during 1995-2012. Each ON case was matched with 10 randomly selected population control subjects from general population. For all participants, we obtained a complete hospital history of comorbidities included in the CharlsonComorbidity Index 5 years preceding the inclusion date. results 4107 ON cases and 41 063 controls were included. The incidence of ON increased from 3.9 in 1995 to 5.5 in 2012 per 100 000 inhabitants. Solid cancer was the most common comorbidity, associated with an adjusted OR (aOR) for ON of 2.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.2). For advanced metastatic cancer, leukaemia and lymphoma, aORs of ON were 3.4 (95% CI 2.5 to 4.5), 4.3 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.0) and 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.8), respectively. Among other chronic conditions, aORs were 3.5 (95% CI 3.0 to 4.1) for connective tissue diseases and 2.3 (95% CI 2.0 to 2.7) for chronic pulmonary diseases. aORs were also increased at 2.8 (95% CI 1.9 to 4.1) and 4.5 (95% CI 2.5 to 8.2) for mild and moderate-to-severe liver disease, respectively, and 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.2) for renal disease. Conclusion This large population-based study provides evidence for an increasing ON incidence in the general population and documents an association between several common comorbid conditions and risk of ON.","The exact incidence of osteonecrosis (ON), a rare disorder with severe clinical outcomes, remains unknown in most countries and reported risk estimates vary substantially. [1] [2] [3] [4] In Great Britain, annual ON incidences ranged from 1.4 to 3.0 per 100 000 inhabitants between 1989 and 2003, 2 while incidence rates lower than 1.0 per 100 000 inhabitants were reported in the Netherlands in [2003] [2004] . 3 For femoral ON, reportedly comprising around 80% of all ON events, 2 5 up to 6.3 episodes per 100 000 inhabitants have been predicted to occur in the USA 4 ; while other authors suggested more than 15 ON cases per 100 000 inhabitants when evaluating total joint arthroplasties. 1 From Asia, a non-traumatic femoral ON incidence of 2.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants has been reported in the Fukuoka Prefecture of Japan. 6 Among patients with cancer, 7 8 pulmonary diseases, 5 9-11 immunological conditions, 8 11 12 renal diseases 13 or organ transplantation, 8 14 15 corticosteroid therapy has been associated with increased risk of ON. Further, important lifestyle factors, including tobacco use 16 17 and high alcohol consumption, [16] [17] [18] may increase ON risk."
Knowledge and awareness of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus among Saudi and Non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims Original Article,The current study was intended to evaluate the knowledge and awareness toward Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and from different Arabian countries.,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks. 1 MERS-CoV was firstly detected in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and responsible for at least 1864 laboratoryconfirmed cases with approximately 35% case fatality. Although the disease was detected in about 27 countries, >80% of cases were detected in Saudi Arabia. 2 MERS-CoV is classified as lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. 3 Insecteating bats are currently the known potential reservoir host for MERS-CoV 4,5 while dromedary camels are the known potential animal host. 6, 7 Consumption of raw camel products and direct contact with camels may constitute a possible role of disease transmission. 8 MERS-CoV affects all ages. The clinical epidemiology of MERS-CoV cases showed similarity to the seasonal flu; however, severe cases have been reported in elderly individuals and immune compromised patients with underlying conditions. 9 Health-care workers are among the risk groups 2 and asymptomatic health-care workers spread illness among hospitalized patients. 10 Annually, Saudi Arabia hosts at least three million Muslims from different nationalities at the same time in Mekkah during the pilgrimage season. Pilgrims also visit Medinah after finishing the pilgrimage rituals. Accordingly, there is a possibility of transmission of different diseases among pilgrims. Interestingly, no notification of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases during pilgrimage seasons was reported; however, several imported MERS-CoV cases were recorded among returning individuals who visited Mekkah and Medinah in different countries including the Netherlands, UK, Algeria, Tunisia, and Malaysia. [11] [12] [13] Appropriate public health responses are dependent on highquality knowledge and awareness about important aspects International Journal of Health Sciences Vol. 11, Issue 5 (November -December 2017) of the disease. Whenever facing an outbreak, there is always a need for health education programs to raise the public awareness with regular evaluation of the level of knowledge to fill gaps of deficient or lack of information. MERS-CoV is a good case in point that constituted a real panic to populations. Preparing population adequately for this threat involves action on many fronts, including enhancing the public awareness toward the basic knowledge about the disease that is one key pillar of an enhanced outbreak investigation, response, and control system. We argue that our thinking should converge on the public awareness and we should address the gaps of all disciplines of the disease. The initial public health response to the MERS-CoV have been poorly calibrated owing to early estimates of the case fatality rate. 14 What was initially thought to be a potential threat and severe novel coronavirus turned out to be no more severe than an average respiratory infection. 15, 16 The current study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge and awareness of the Saudi and non-Saudi-Arabian pilgrims regarding the MERS-CoV."
"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor divergent viruses, including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses using an alternative genetic code","Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from wildlife and bats are a major reservoir of viruses, a few of which have been highly pathogenic to humans. In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families. Finally, the results of the phage community analyses of these bats indicate a very diverse geographically distinct bat phage population, probably reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems.","Emerging infectious diseases have a serious impact on human health and our economy and unfortunately, their upward trend has not yet been halted (Mackey et al. 2014) . About 60-80% of these emerging infections originate from wildlife including bats (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001) . Some bats (Order Chiroptera) have been implicated as a major reservoir of pathogenic zoonotic viruses such as rabies virus, Marburg virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses (CoVs), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Rupprecht et al. 1995; Chua et al. 2002; Lau et al. 2005; Leroy et al. 2005; Towner et al. 2007; Memish et al. 2013) . Bats make up more than 20% of the $5,500 known terrestrial species of mammals (Nowak 1991; Vaughan and Ryan 2000) and have a combination of features that is believed to enhance their ability to facilitate virus evolution and transmission such as longevity, migratory activity, large and dense roosting communities, and close social interactions (Prendergast et al. 2002; Luis et al. 2013) . Additionally, it has been speculated that some viruses which evolved with bats may use cellular receptors and biochemical pathways which are conserved in mammals that evolved later, thus enhancing their ability to transmit these viruses to other mammals including humans (Calisher et al. 2006) . Apart from human behavioral changes (driven by increasing human populations) and spatial expansion of agriculture, direct contact with bats through hunting, selling, and/or eating might provide great opportunity for such zoonotic transmissions (Morse 2001) , which is the case in Lysoka, Limbe and Moyuka in the Southwest Region of Cameroon."
Non-lytic antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia does not attenuate inflammation: the PRISTINE trial,Background: The inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is primarily driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components [lipoteichoic acid (LTA)]. An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with b-lactam antibiotics.,"The host inflammatory response in pneumococcal disease contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. 1 As in other infections with Gram-positive bacteria, the inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is primarily driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components [lipoteichoic acid (LTA)] or the release of intracellular proteins. 2 LTA is recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor on macrophages. Binding of LTA to TLR2 induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) and neutrophil influx. 3, 4 Bacterial cell wall components are released when bacteria are killed by autolysis or host immune cells, and are important determinants of the severity of inflammation. 5 An acute breakdown of the bacterial cell wall occurs upon exposure to b-lactam antibiotics, 6 the first-line treatment for pneumococcal infections in many guidelines. 7, 8 Reduction of release of bacterial cell wall products may decrease inflammation, reduce tissue damage and, ultimately, reduce morbidity and mortality. Strategies to dampen the host inflammatory response have been studied extensively. Currently, dexamethasone adjunctive treatment in patients with pneumococcal meningitis is used in high-income countries to diminish inflammatory responses and, consequently, neurological sequelae. 9 In community-acquired pneumonia, macrolides seem to have an immune modulatory effect by enhancing the antibacterial effect of neutrophils and by quashing the immune response after bacterial killing. 10 However, in a clinical trial, b-lactam monotherapy was non-inferior to macrolide with b-lactam combination therapy. 11 Another potential approach is to kill the bacteria without immediately lysing them, thus preventing the release of pro-inflammatory cell wall products. 12 This would reduce the complete inflammatory trigger by interfering at the beginning of the inflammation cascade."
Matrix stiffness modulates infection of endothelial cells by Listeria monocytogenes via expression of cell surface vimentin,"Extracellular matrix stiffness (ECM) is one of the many mechanical forces acting on mammalian adherent cells and an important determinant of cellular function. While the effect of ECM stiffness on many aspects of cellular behavior has been studied previously, how ECM stiffness might mediate susceptibility of host cells to infection by bacterial pathogens is hitherto unexplored.","The extracellular environment of cells provides both chemical and mechanical stimuli to influence cell behavior and function (Chien et al., 2005; Geiger et al., 2009) . Extracellular matrix stiffness (ECM), one of the many mechanical forces acting on cells, is an important determinant of cellular behavior for most adherent mammalian cells (Wells, 2008; Gattazzo et al., 2014) . Cells can sense the stiffness of their matrix, which can vary over many orders of magnitude, and accordingly alter their motility, adhesion, growth, and differentiation (Discher et al., 2005; Birukova et al., 2013) . Yet the exact pathways by which cells sense mechanical signals and transduce them to generate biological signal cascades and specific cellular responses are not yet fully understood (Trepat et al., 2008) ."
IMG/VR: a database of cultured and uncultured DNA Viruses and retroviruses,"Viruses represent the most abundant life forms on the planet. Recent experimental and computational improvements have led to a dramatic increase in the number of viral genome sequences identified primarily from metagenomic samples. As a result of the expanding catalog of metagenomic viral sequences, there exists a need for a comprehensive computational platform integrating all these sequences with associated metadata and analytical tools. Here we present IMG/VR (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr/), the largest publicly available database of 3908 isolate reference DNA viruses with 264 413 computationally identified viral contigs from >6000 ecologically diverse metagenomic samples. Approximately half of the viral contigs are grouped into genetically distinct quasi-species clusters. Microbial hosts are predicted for 20 000 viral sequences, revealing nine microbial phyla previously unreported to be infected by viruses. Viral sequences can be queried using a variety of associated metadata, including habitat type and geographic location of the samples, or taxonomic classification according to hallmark viral genes. IMG/VR has a user-friendly interface that allows users to interrogate all integrated data and interact by comparing with external sequences, thus serving as an essential resource in the viral genomics community.","Viruses are key players in nature able to infect organisms from the three domains of life and found across all known ecological niches (1) therefore affecting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . However, due to limitations primarily related to identifying and culturing them, the detection of environmental viruses remained very limited until the advent of metagenomic approaches (6) . Since then, a number of environmental viromes have been scrutinized providing a broader view of the diversity and distribution of viruses (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Unfortunately, this information usually remains scattered across different repositories -such as general data repository databases (e.g. GenBank (14) or EMBL (15)), or virus-specific databases (e.g. virus pathogen resource (16) ), recombinant virus database (17) , and hepatitis B database (18) ). Furthermore, metadata such as isolation source or habitat where the virus was originally identified, or information about its putative host, often remains elusive or not available in several of these databases. More recent works are making a great progress towards an effort to provide a centralized resource for viral data and associated tools (19) . However, despite the excellent existing resources, we still lack a data management and visualization environment integrating viral genes, genomes, clusters, functions, associated host and habitat with analytical tools that would enable large-scale comparative analysis of the global virome."
Vaccines for emerging pathogens: from research to the clinic,"In this two-part series of reviews, we have invited experts in their fields to contribute articles on the status of vaccine research and development for emerging pathogens. This topic has been brought into sharp focus in recent years following significant outbreaks of viral diseases such as those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as devastating outbreaks of diseases caused by the Ebola, Marburg, Zika and Lassa fever viruses, to name only a few examples. Additionally, bacterial infections leading to bubonic and pneumonic plague, most notably in Madagascar in 2018, as well as malaria in many tropical countries, melioidosis in south east Asia and tularaemia in northern Europe and North America, have incurred significant morbidity and mortality. In this review series, the life cycle of these pathogens and the epidemiology of disease have been reviewed in the context of potential points of intervention for the prevention of human infection. Many of the emerging pathogens are zoonoses and, as such, there is scope for intervention at the animal/insect/environmental reservoir. Other pathogens covered in this review series are considered to be re-emerging, such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.","Historically, vaccines have had enormous impact on human health, eradicating smallpox, polio and many other childhood and adult infections of public health concern. Worldwide, attention is now turning to the task of vaccines for these emerging and re-emerging pathogens, with renewed interest and support from international governments, the World Health Organization (WHO) and organizations such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and philanthropic organizations such as the Gates Foundation. This review series sets out to survey the progress to date. In their article, Afrough, Dowall and Hewson [1] review a range of emerging viruses and make the case for applying molecular techniques to understand viral pathogenesis. The authors discuss the exploitation of vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non-replicating viral vectors; they suggest that the use of viral vector platforms should accelerate progress, as the insertion of a gene for a new antigen allows rapid targeting of newly emerging diseases. They point out, however, that despite 50 years of research and the preclinical evaluation of many vaccine candidates for the Lassa fever virus, for example, that no vaccine has yet been approved and suggest that economic factors such as the lack of a commercial market have impeded progress. There needs to be concerted international action to overcome the regulatory hurdles to bring vaccines for these emerging pathogens into clinical use."

Surgical Transplantation of Mouse Neural Stem Cells into the Spinal Cords of Mice Infected with Neurotropic Mouse Hepatitis Virus,"Mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) develop pathological and clinical outcomes similar to patients with the demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We have shown that transplantation of NSCs into the spinal cords of sick mice results in a significant improvement in both remyelination and in clinical outcome. Cell replacement therapies for the treatment of chronic neurologic diseases are now a reality and in vivo models are vital in understanding the interactions between the engrafted cells and host tissue microenvironment. This presentation provides an adapted method for transplanting cells into the spinal cord of JHMV-infected mice. In brief, we provide a procedure for i) preparation of NSCs prior to transplant, ii) pre-operative care of mice, iii) exposure of the spinal cord via laminectomy, iv) stereotactic injection of NSCs, and iv) post-operative care.","1. Frequently change and/or sterilize gloves throughout the procedure. Position the mouse dorsal side up with head pointing to the left (if you are right handed). Drape animal to ensure sterility and that only the shaved area is exposed. Make a vertical incision (˜1.3cm) over the laminecomy site spanning from about thoracic vertebrae T8 to T12. 2. With the graefe forceps held in the left hand, firmly secure the spinal column at T9 ( Figure 1A) and lift the mouse up to exaggerate the spinal curvature. 3. Use the scalpel to score the junction between T10 and T11, the space between the two spiny protrusions. Further expose the junction by carefully scrapping the muscle layer away to expose the bone (see Figure 1B ,C). 4. Use the scissors to further clear muscle away from the lamina and around the pedicle with small snips. This will open up a small space between the vertebrae. Slowly and delicately insert one blade of the scissors into this gap and snip the pedicle. Make sure the curvature of the scissors is always positioned laterally, away from the cord. Repeat on the other side. (see Figure 1D ,E) 5. Lift the lamina to expose the cord and carefully snip it off. Be sure not to leave any free or jagged bone fragments behind. (see Figure 1F ) 6. Prior to injection, clean any blood away with sterile cotton swabs."
EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of levodopa (LEV) on cellular apoptosis in a rabbit model of steroid-associated necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH). A total of 44 healthy adult Chinese rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: Group A (n=15), administered a combination of lipopolysaccharide and hormone to establish the SANFH animal model; group B (n=15), SANFH animal model as in group A orally administered LEV (0.4 g/kg/day) on the day of injection; and group C (n=14), the control group. On the 6th and 8th week of modeling, seven rabbits from each group were sacrificed to harvest bilateral femoral head specimens for hematoxylin and eosin staining and apoptosis detection by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay analysis, as well as for observing pathological changes and analyzing cellular apoptosis. Eight weeks after modeling, the serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels of the three groups were measured. The empty lacunae rate and apoptosis index of bone cells in the treatment group were significantly lower than that of the model group (P<0.01). Eight weeks after treatment, the serum levels of IGF-1 were significantly higher than that of the model group (P<0.01). These findings suggested that LEV was able to reduce steroid-induced bone cellular apoptosis, reduce the occurrence of necrosis of the femoral head and, through in vivo metabolism, it may promote the synthesis and release of IGF-1, which could be one of its biological pathways to prevent and treat SANFH.","Since the 1950s, glucocorticoids had been widely used in clinical practice as an effective means of treating diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and those caused by kidney transplantation, resulting in an increase in the number of steroid-associated necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) cases (1) (2) (3) . SANFH is the most common cause of non-traumatic osteonecrosis (2) . For the past 40 years, Chinese and foreign researchers have investigated SANFH; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. There are a variety of theories as to what is associated with the pathogenesis SANFH, including dyslipidemia, intravascular coagulation, immune complex deposition-induced arterial inflammation, osteoporosis, venous stasis-induced intra-bone high pressure and hormonal toxicity of bone cells. The above theories also did not clearly prove that the bone cells exhibited necrosis, because no necrosis-specific inflammatory responses cell swelling were found (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Therefore, SANFH lacks effective prevention and early treatment strategies (9) . Previous studies have shown that hormones not only promote the apoptosis of bone cells, osteoblasts and cartilage cells, but are involved in the pathological process of femoral head necrosis (10, 11) . The present study utilized single low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus methylprednisolone (MPS) to establish a rabbit model of SANFH. The roles of levodopa (LEV) in cellular apoptosis were observed in the rabbit model of SANFH, with the aim of providing a basis for the prevention and early treatment of femoral head necrosis."

They are widespread and can be found in many species of mice, horses, whales, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, and humans (1) . Development of the infection, can lead to additional complications, including respiratory tract disease and organ dysfunction, particularly renal failure and immune suppression, enteric, neurologic or hepatic diseases (2, 3) . The majority of patients have typical symptoms, such as fever with or without cough, and breathing difficulties (4) . Mid-dle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new and unknown origin respiratory virus with genotypic and phenotypic diversity; thus, this virus can mutate, increasing its virulence and even causing tissue tropism. There is a high-frequency mortality rate around > 50% and median age of the majority of identified cases affected with this virus is 56 years. Very little is known about its behavior (5, 6) . Humans are known to maintain circulation of four different human coronaviruses (hCoVs) at a global population level. These are a part of the spectrum of agents that cause the common cold. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV constitutes the fifth hCoV, which was in circulation for a limited time during 2002 and 2003, when a virus appeared in humans and caused an outbreak affecting at least 8,000 people. Symptoms matched the clinical picture of acute primary viral pneumonia. MERS-CoV, a novel coronavirus, was detected for the first time in September of 2012 in Saudi Arabia, an area heavily impacted by this virus at present. Between April and June 2013, 81 cases of infection by this hCoV were reported in Saudi Arabia. Of those, 49 patients died, so fatality rate is high (2) . This virus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory infection in humans (7) . Subsequently MERS-CoV has been reported in other countries, including Tunisia, United Arab, Emirates, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Qatar (2, (8) (9) (10) (11) . The first cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Iran were two cases in Kerman, a city in southeast Iran. The virus killed one of them, a 53-year-old woman. With the appearance of new cases, in view of the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to humans (6) , and because of severe infections that have been observed among the elderly, there is considerable concern about this virus (5) . Although few cases have been reported annually (around 34 case as of 12 May 2013), the morbidity and mortality rate of this infection is alarming (7) . Unfortunately, at present, there are no specific treatments or effective drugs for this deadly disease, and no vaccine. In the absence of an effective treatment, the appropriate infection controls include rapid diagnostics and isolation of patients, useful strategies for preventing further transmission and spread of this infectious agent (5) . Currently, real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are used for detection of MERS-CoV in respiratory, blood, and stool samples of patients. Real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and is able to detect viruses even in low copy numbers (12, 13)."
Ebola Emergency Preparedness: Simulation Training for Frontline Health Care Professionals,"Introduction: At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we identified the need for a comprehensive training program designed to prepare frontline staff to safely manage a patient with Ebola viral disease (EVD). The primary goal of this program was to ensure the safety of staff, patients, and the general public by training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) before, during, and after care of patients with EVD. Methods: We delivered a 4-hour experiential training program to frontline health care professionals who would be expected to care for a patient with EVD. The program occurred in a simulation center with multiple flexible spaces and consisted of demonstration, multiple skills practice sessions, and a patient simulation case. We analyzed completed pre-and posttraining questionnaires. The questionnaire assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: donning and doffing PPE, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and management of a contamination breach. Results: This program was effectively deployed in the STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation over a 4-month period, with 220 health care professionals participating in the training and 195 participants completing the pre-/posttraining questionnaires. Our intervention significantly increased the confidence of participants on each primary objective (p = .001 for all three stations). Discussion: This interprofessional simulation-based program has been shown to be a well-received method of training clinicians to manage patients collaboratively during an EVD outbreak. Our intent is that the skills taught in this training program would also be transferable to management of other infectious diseases in the clinical setting.","training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Many hospital-wide drills and training sessions were implemented in response to the recent Ebola epidemic. Here, we describe a simulation laboratory-based program that was used as the foundation training for frontline staff in the correct use of PPE for clinical care activities."
Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays,"There is an increasing recognition that detailed nucleic acid sequence information will be useful and even required in the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of many significant pathogens. Because generating detailed information about pathogens leads to significantly larger amounts of data, it is necessary to develop automated analysis methods to reduce analysis time and to standardize identification criteria. This is especially important for multiple pathogen assays designed to reduce assay time and costs. In this paper, we present a successful algorithm for detecting pathogens and reporting the maximum level of detail possible using multipathogen resequencing microarrays. The algorithm filters the sequence of base calls from the microarray and finds entries in genetic databases that most closely match. Taxonomic databases are then used to relate these entries to each other so that the microorganism can be identified. Although developed using a resequencing microarray, the approach is applicable to any assay method that produces base call sequence information. The success and continued development of this approach means that a non-expert can now perform unassisted analysis of the results obtained from partial sequence data.","For both surveillance and diagnostic applications, fine-scale pathogen identification and near-neighbor discrimination is important; therefore, an assay that monitors at this very specific level is desirable for many types of samples such as clinical and environmental (1) (2) (3) . To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data. Several well-established techniques use PCR to amplify individual target pieces of sequenced genomes to provide detection of organisms (4) . These methods can roughly be divided into approaches that target individual short sequence lengths or probes (<40 bp) and methods that examine longer probes. The advantage of using short probes is that when the uniqueness of the probe has been assured and unique primers are also selected, this method gives good specificity. This approach is capable of providing fine-scale identification of several genetically close organisms by selecting a sufficient number of probes. However, this can rapidly lead to a very large number of total probes being required to detect all organisms of interest. In addition these selected probes, which in the initial selection process were determined to be unique, are often later found to be less specific as more organisms are sequenced or are less specific under conditions that differ from the original conditions. This is particularly a problem for organisms belonging to a family with a high mutation rate and also for pathogens that have relatively few neighboring pathogens sequenced. In addition, PCR approaches focused on short unique probes are not capable of detecting the presence of new significant mutations nor can they easily resolve base sequence details. Approaches that use longer individual probes avoid many of these issues at the cost of being less specific. This issue means most of these approaches are not suitable for providing the information desired, providing impetus to this work."
"Full Paper Design, Synthesis, and Antiviral Activity of Novel Ribonucleosides of 1,2,3-Triazolylbenzyl-aminophosphonates","A novel series of ribonucleosides of 1,2,3-triazolylbenzyl-aminophosphonates was synthesized through the Kabachnik-Fields reaction using I 2 as catalyst followed by copper-catalyzed cycloaddition of the azide-alkyne reaction (CuAAC). All structures of the newly prepared compounds were characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and HRMS spectra. The structures of 2e, 2f, 3d, and 3g were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. These compounds were tested against various strains of DNA and RNA viruses; compounds 4b and 4c showed a modest inhibitory activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and compound 4h displayed modest inhibitory activity against Coxsackie virus B4.","Currently, most of the human beings in the world suffer from different kinds of diseases caused by DNA and RNA viruses. These diseases are mostly diagnosed but difficult to cure. Vaccination is a reliable tool to fight viral diseases, but it is only available against few viruses. The difficulties associated with national or worldwide vaccination programs make antiviral chemotherapy an even more practical approach in the fight against epidemic viral infections. Nucleoside analogs are synthetic compounds that are structurally similar to natural nucleosides and can serve as building blocks of DNA and RNA. They can act as competitive inhibitors of viral and cellular DNA and RNA polymerases or alternatively can be incorporated into growing DNA and RNA strands causing chain termination [1] ."
Retention of p63 in an ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment Depends on the Presence of All Three of Its Domains and on Its Ability to Form Oligomers,The type H membrane protein p63 is a resi-,"dent protein of a membrane network interposed between rough ER and Golgi apparatus. To study the retention of p63, mutant forms were expressed in COS cells and the intracellular distribution determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Investigation of chimeric constructs between p63 and the plasma membrane protein dipeptidylpeptidase IV showed that protein sequences from all three domains of the p63 protein are required to achieve complete intracellular retention. Mutational analysis of the 106-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of p63 revealed that the NH2-terminal 23 amino acids are necessary for retention. When Igi3 was solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g, it formed large, insoluble oligomers, particularly at neutral pH and below. A comparison of the behavior of wildtype and mutant p63 proteins in this assay revealed a perfect correlation between the formation of large oligomers and correct intracellular retention. These results suggest that self-association may be a major mechanism by which p63 is retained between the rough ER and the Golgi apparatus."
European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine Severe Immune Thrombocytopenia Complicated by Intracerebral Haemorrhage Associated with Coronavirus Infection: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder that causes isolated thrombocytopenia. Many viruses have been identified as triggering the autoimmune process, including HIV, MCV, EBV, parvovirus, rubella and measles. However, ITP in association with coronavirus infection has not previously been reported. We describe the case of a healthy man who presented with severe ITP complicated by intracranial haemorrhage following upper respiratory tract infection. An infection screen revealed coronavirus infection.","Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a rare haematological disorder formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura before the autoimmune mechanism was identified and found to be triggered by many, mostly viral, infectious agents.

We present a case of severe thrombocytopenia complicated by intracranial haemorrhage following infection with a coronavirus, which has not previously been reported."
Human Mig Chemokine: Biochemical and Functional Characterization,"Mig is a chemokine of the CXC subfamily that was discovered by differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from lymphokine-activated macrophages. The mig gene is inducible in macrophages and in other cells in response to interferon (IFN)-% We have transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with cDNA encoding human Mig and we have derived CHO cell lines from which we have purified recombinant human Mig (rHuMig). rHuMig induced the transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) and in cultured, activated human peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. No responses were seen in human neutrophils, monocytes, or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines. rHuMig was chemotactic for TIL by a modified Boyden chamber assay but rHuMig was not chemotactic for neutrophils or monocytes. The CHO cell lines, IFN-~/-treated human peripheral-blood monocytes, and IFN-~/-treated cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 all secreted multiple and identical HuMig species as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Using the CHO-derived rHuMig, we have shown that the species' heterogeneity is due to proteolytic cleavage at basic carboxy-terminal residues, and that the proteolysis occurs before and not after rHuMig secretion by the CHO cells. The major species of secreted rHuMig ranged from 78 to 103 amino acids in length, the latter corresponding to the full-length secreted protein predicted from the HuMig cDNA. Carboxy-terminal-truncated forms ofrHuMig were of lower specific activity compared to full-length rHuMig in the calcium flux assay, and the truncated species did not block the activity of the full-length species. It is likely that HuMig plays a role in T cell trafficking and perhaps in other aspects of the physiology of activated T cells.","man basophils (13) ; the CXC chemokine IL-8 is an angiogenic factor (14) ; and other CXC chemokines, platelet factor 4 (15) and , can inhibit angiogenesis."
Cell-penetrating peptides as transporters for morpholino oligomers: effects of amino acid composition on intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity,"Arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising transporters for intracellular delivery of antisense morpholino oligomers (PMO). Here, we determined the effect of L-arginine, D-arginine and non-a amino acids on cellular uptake, splicecorrection activity, cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 CPP2PMOs. Insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) or b-alanine (B) residues into oligoarginine R 8 decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice-correction activity of the resulting compound, with a greater increase for the sequences containing more X residues. Cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10 kM. Up to 60 kM, only the conjugates with 5 5 Xs exhibited time-and concentration-dependent toxicity. Substitution of L-arginine with D-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. High concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing X or B. In summary, incorporation of X/B into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of CPPÀPMO. Toxicity of X/B-containing conjugates was affected by the number of Xs, treatment time and concentration. More active, stable and less toxic CPPs can be designed by optimizing the position and number of R, D-R, X and B residues.","Steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are considered potential therapeutics for genetic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and b-thalassemia. For their potential to be realized, however, the AOs must be effectively delivered to cell nuclei."
"Cyclosporin A and Its Analogs Inhibit Hepatitis B Virus Entry Into Cultured Hepatocytes Through Targeting a Membrane Transporter, Sodium Taurocholate Cotransporting Polypeptide (NTCP)","Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. Although nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase are clinically available as anti-HBV agents, emergence of drug-resistant viruses highlights the need for new anti-HBV agents interfering with other targets. Here we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) can inhibit HBV entry into cultured hepatocytes. The anti-HBV effect of CsA was independent of binding to cyclophilin and calcineurin. Rather, blockade of HBV infection correlated with the ability to inhibit the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). We also found that HBV infection-susceptible cells, differentiated HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes expressed NTCP, while nonsusceptible cell lines did not. A series of compounds targeting NTCP could inhibit HBV infection. CsA inhibited the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Evaluation of CsA analogs identified a compound with higher anti-HBV potency, having a median inhibitory concentration <0.2 lM. Conclusion: This study provides a proof of concept for the novel strategy to identify anti-HBV agents by targeting the candidate HBV receptor, NTCP, using CsA as a structural platform. (HEPATOLOGY 2014;59:1726-1737 ","H epatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a substantial public health problem, affecting 350 million people worldwide. 1-3 HBV-infected patients have an elevated risk for developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, clinical treatment for HBV infection includes interferon alpha (IFN-a) and nucleos(t)ide analogs. IFN-a therapy yields long-term clinical benefit in only less than 40% of patients and can cause significant side effects. Nucleos(t)ide analog treatment can suppress HBV replication and is accompanied by substantial biochemical and histological improvement; however, it may select for drug-resistant viruses, which limit the efficacy of long-term treatment. To overcome these problems, the development of new anti-HBV agents targeting a different step of the HBV life cycle is urgently needed."
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Dovepress virus-induced secondary bacterial infection: a concise review,"Respiratory diseases are a very common source of morbidity and mortality among children. Health care providers often face a dilemma when encountering a febrile infant or child with respiratory tract infection. The reason expressed by many clinicians is the trouble to confirm whether the fever is caused by a virus or a bacterium. The aim of this review is to update the current evidence on the virus-induced bacterial infection. We present several clinical as well in vitro studies that support the correlation between virus and secondary bacterial infections. In addition, we discuss the pathophysiology and prevention modes of the virus-bacterium coexistence. A search of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases was carried out for published articles covering bacterial infections associated with respiratory viruses. This review should provide clinicians with a comprehensive idea of the range of bacterial and viral coinfections or secondary infections that could present with viral respiratory illness.","Viral respiratory tract infections (VRTIs) are very common in children and their presentations vary from simple colds to life-threatening infections. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The detection of a respiratory virus does not necessarily infer that the child has only a viral infection, 6 since outbreaks of VRTIs are being linked to increased incidence of bacterial coinfections. 7 The human body is usually capable of eliminating respiratory viral infections with no sequelae; however, in some cases, viruses bypass the immune response of the airways, causing conceivable severe respiratory diseases. 8 Robust mechanical and immunosuppressive processes protect the lungs against external infections, but a single respiratory tract infection might change immunity and pathology. 9 Health care providers often face a dilemma when encountering a febrile infant or child with respiratory tract infection. The reason expressed by many clinicians is the challenge to confirm whether the fever is caused by a virus or bacterium. 10 Acute otitis media (AOM) is a usual bacterial coinfection that occurs in 20%-60% of cases of VRTIs. [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition, almost 60% of children with VRTI have changes in the maxillary, ethmoidal, and frontal sinuses. 11, 12 Moreover, in the year 1918, it was estimated that 40-50 million individuals died from the influenza pandemic, many of which were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae. 15"
"Ceramide Accumulation Uncovers a Cycling Pathway for the cis -Golgi Network Marker, Infectious Bronchitis Virus M Protein","The M glycoprotein from the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), contains information for localization to the cis -Golgi network in its first transmembrane domain. We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-","1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms. Further, ceramide accumulation reveals this cycle by upsetting the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic and/ or disrupting retention by altering bilayer dynamics."
Brief Communication,"Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.","A 54-year-old Korean man living in Wuhan, China entered Korea on January 20, 2020 and felt the first symptoms of chills and muscle pain on January 22.

Successful Treatment of Disseminated Nocardiosis Caused by Nocardia veterana in a Dog,"A 5-year-old male castrated Lhasa Apso cross was evaluated for a 1-month history of inappetence, lethargy, gagging, and progressive right thoracic limb lameness. Synovial fluid analysis revealed nonseptic suppurative inflammation, and a diagnosis of immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) was made. After 3 months of treatment with prednisone and later cyclosporine, the dog developed multiple firm cutaneous and subcutaneous masses and a focal mass within the jejunum. Cultures of blood, urine, skin lesions, and the jejunal mass identified Nocardia veterana by matrix-absorption laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and allowed for earlier identification of the organism compared to more traditional secA1 gene sequencing. Immunosuppressive drug treatment was discontinued, and the dog was treated for 3 months by administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS). No recurrence of clinical signs was reported 1 year later. This case report highlights the clinical utility of MALDI-TOF MS, particularly for the rapid identification of slow-growing, fastidious organisms.","Northern California was evaluated at the William R.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus suppresses post-transcriptionally the protein expression of IFN-β by upregulating cellular microRNAs in porcine alveolar macrophages in vitro,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized to inhibit the response of type I interferon (IFN) both in vivo and in vitro. However, the post-transcriptional mechanism by which PRRSV suppresses type Ⅰ IFN induction in virus-infected host cells remains unclear. The present study first demonstrated that PRRSV inhibited post-transcriptionally the protein induction of IFN-β in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) during early infection, and the inhibition effect mediated by the Chinese highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV was stronger. Next, we analyzed the cellular microRNA (miRNA)-modulated protein expression of porcine IFN-β by dual firefly/Renilla luciferase reporter assay, transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitor assay and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment of PAMs, showing that porcine miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 are able to inhibit IFN-β protein expression in primary PAMs by directly targeting sequences within the porcine IFN-β 3'UTR locating at 160-181, 9-31, 27-47 and 12-32 bp, respectively. Finally, we confirmed that let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, were upregulated in PRRSV-infected PAMs early in vitro, and the expression level of these miRNAs in HP-PRRSV JXwn06-infected PAMs were higher than those in low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9infected PAMs. The endogenous cellular miRNA-mediated inhibition of IFN-β induction in PRRSV-infected PAMs early could be relieved by miRNA antagonists. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time that PRRSV can suppress post-transcriptionally protein expression of IFN-β by upregulating cellular miRNAs in PAMs in vitro, providing novel insight into mechanisms in relation to the PRRSV-mediated immunomodulation of porcine innate immunity.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is characterized by reproductive disorders in pregnant sows and respiratory diseases in growing pigs, is a viral disease caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) (1, 2) .

Ebola virus VP35 has novel NTPase and helicase-like activities,"is recognized as one of the most lethal pathogens in the planet. For RNA viruses, cellular or virusencoded RNA helicases play pivotal roles in viral life cycles by remodelling viral RNA structures and/or unwinding viral dsRNA produced during replication. However, no helicase or helicase-like activity has ever been found to associate with any NNSV-encoded proteins, and it is unknown whether the replication of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral or cellular helicase. Here, we show that despite of containing no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs, EBOV VP35 possesses the NTPase and helicase-like activities that can hydrolyse all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices in an NTP-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, guanidine hydrochloride, an FDAapproved compound and inhibitor of certain viral helicases, inhibited the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 as well as the replication/transcription of an EBOV minigenome replicon in cells, highlighting the importance of VP35 helicase-like activity during EBOV life cycle. Together, our findings provide the first demonstration of the NTPase/helicase-like activity encoded by EBOV, and would foster our understanding of EBOV and NNSVs.","Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filamentous, enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA virus, belonging to the genus Ebolavirus in the family Filoviridae of the order Mononegavirales.

A sensitive and specific antigen detection assay for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Since its emergence in 2012, more than 900 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been reported with a fatality rate of more than 30%. However, no antigen detection assay for commercial use is available for diagnosis. In this study, the full-length nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A MERS-CoV NP capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using two MERS-CoV-NP-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated was developed. The ELISA was evaluated using 129 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) positive for various respiratory viruses and simulated positive NPAs by adding serial dilutions of MERS-CoV. Using a cutoff OD of 0.19, all 129 NPAs positive for respiratory viruses showed very low OD, with a specificity of 100%. For the two simulated MERS-CoV-positive NPAs with serial dilutions of live MERS-CoV, all samples with o10 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/0.1 mL showed positive results. For the 10 additional NPAs with 20 and 200 TCID 50 /0.1 mL of live MERS-CoV added, all were positive. A highly sensitive and specific MAbs-based antigen capture ELISA has been developed for MERS. This sensitive and specific antigen capture ELISA should be useful for detection of MERS-CoV in human and dromedaries and in field studies.","Since its emergence in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected more than 20 countries globally with a total of more than 900 laboratory-confirmed cases and a fatality rate of over 30%.

The persistence of the epidemic may be partly due to the difficulty to control the contact between the people and dromedary camels, a major zoonotic source of MERS-CoV.

"Origin, Evolution, and Virulence of Porcine Deltacoronaviruses in the United States","A novel porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCV) was first discovered in Ohio and Indiana in February 2014, rapidly spread to other states in the United States and Canada, and caused significant economic loss in the swine industry. The origin and virulence of this novel porcine coronavirus are not known. Here, we characterized U.S. PdCV isolates and determined their virulence in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets. Genome analyses revealed that U.S. PdCV isolates possess unique genetic characteristics and share a close relationship with Hong Kong and South Korean PdCV strains and coronaviruses (CoVs) of Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret-badgers. The PdCV-positive intestinal content (Ohio CVM1) and the cell culture-adapted PdCV Michigan (MI) strain were orally inoculated into gnotobiotic and/or conventional piglets. Within 1 to 3 days postinfection, profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration were observed. Clinical signs were associated with epithelial necrosis in the gastric pits and small intestine, the latter resulting in severe villous atrophy. Mild interstitial pneumonia was identified in the lungs of PdCVinfected piglets. High levels of viral RNA (8 to 11 log RNA copies/g) were detected in intestinal tissues/luminal contents and feces of infected piglets, whereas moderate RNA levels (2 to 5 log RNA copies/g) were detected in blood, lung, liver, and kidney, indicating multisystemic dissemination of the virus.","The Deltacoronavirus genus has been only recently defined by genomic sequence analysis of both pig and avian isolates (15) . Since 2009, avian deltacoronaviruses have been detected in a wide range of domestic and wild birds (15) (16) (17) . The porcine deltacoronaviruses (PdCV) Hong Kong (HK) strains HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 were recently detected in rectal swabs from pigs (15) . The potential of the HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 PdCVs to cause significant clinical disease in swine is not known. In mid-January 2014, PdCV was identified in fatal cases of PEDV-negative diarrhea in Ohio piglets (18) . Field reports document a history and clinical presentation (vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration) typical of TGEV and PEDV; like for the other swine enteric CoVs, morbidity and mortality rates at PdCV-infected farms are high (18) (19) (20) (21) . In some instances, PdCV is the only virus recovered from these diarrhea outbreaks; in others, it may be present as a coinfection with PEDV. To date, outbreaks have been documented in more than 20 states in the United States. In April 2014, a PdCV strain (KOR/KNU14-04/2014) was also identified in feces from diarrheic piglets in South Korea (22) ."
Complement-Mediated Neutralization of Dengue Virus Requires Mannose-Binding Lectin,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key soluble pathogen recognition protein of the innate immune system that binds specific mannose-containing glycans on the surfaces of microbial agents and initiates complement activation via the lectin pathway. Prior studies showed that MBL-dependent activation of the complement cascade neutralized insect cell-derived West Nile virus (WNV) in cell culture and restricted pathogenesis in mice. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of MBL in infection by dengue virus (DENV), a related flavivirus. Using a panel of naïve sera from mouse strains deficient in different complement components,","and member of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. DENV infection continues to spread globally with an estimated 70 to 100 human million infections, 2.1 million clinically severe cases, and 21,000 deaths per year (1) . Following mosquito inoculation, DENV infection in humans can be clinically silent (asymptomatic) or cause syndromes ranging from a febrile illness (classic dengue fever [DF] ) to a life-threatening hemorrhage and vascular permeability syndrome (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [DHF/DSS]) (2) . Although the pathogenesis of DENV infection remains controversial, antibodydependent enhancement of DENV infection in Fc-␥ receptorbearing cells, effects of virulent strains, a proinflammatory cytokine storm secondary to exuberant activation of poorly lytic cross-reactive T cells, and excessive complement activation have been suggested as possible mechanisms (reviewed in reference 3)."
The First Membrane Spanning Region of the Lamin B Receptor Is Sufficient for Sorting to the Inner Nuclear Membrane,"The lamin B receptor (LBR) is a polytopic integral membrane protein localized exclusively in the inner nuclear membrane domain of the nuclear envelope. Its cDNA deduced primary structure consists of a highly charged amino-terminal domain of 205 residues that faces the nucleoplasm followed by a hydrophobic domain with eight potential transmembrane segments. To identify determinants that sort LBR from its site of integration (RER and outer nuclear membrane) to the inner nuclear membrane, we prepared full-length, truncated, and chimeric cDNA constructs of chick LBR, transfected these into mammalian cells and detected the expressed protein by immunofluorescence microscopy using appropriate antibodies. Surprisingly, we found that the determinants for sorting of LBR to the inner nuclear membrane reside in a region comprising its first transmembrane sequence plus flanking residues on either side. The other transmembrane regions as well as the nucleoplasmic domain are not required for sorting. We propose that the first transmembrane segment of LBR interacts specifically with another transmembrane segment and consider several mechanisms by which such specific interaction could result in sorting to the inner nuclear membrane.","U 'SING solution and solid state binding assays, isolated lamin B from turkey nuclei has previously been shown to bind to an integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope termed the lamin B receptor (LBR) 1 or p58 (because of its apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE) 0Vorman et al., 1988) . Cell fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy (Yuan, J., H. J. Worman, and G. Blobel, unpublished results) revealed that LBR is exclusively localized in the inner nuclear membrane. LBR's eDNA deduced primary structure showed a protein of 637 amino acid residues with two major domains: an amino terminal hydrophilic and basic domain of 205 residues followed by a predominantly hydrophobic region with eight putative transmembrane segments . The amino terminal domain of 205 residues is likely located on the nucleoplasmic (rather than the cisternal) side of the inner membrane because it contains all of LBR's consensus sites for various kinases (Feramisco et al., 1980; Moreno and Nurse, 1990) and LBR has been shown to be a phosphoprotein (Applebaum et al., 1990) . The amino terminal nucleoplasmic domain of LBR also contains SPXX motifs that are characteristic of nucleic acid binding proteins (Suzuki, 1989) . It is not known, however, whether LBR interacts with nucleic acids."
Crystal structure and activity-based labeling reveal the mechanisms for linkage-specific substrate recognition by deubiquitinase USP9X,"USP9X is a conserved deubiquitinase (DUB) that regulates multiple cellular processes. Dysregulation of USP9X has been linked to cancers and X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we report the crystal structure of the USP9X catalytic domain at 2.5-Å resolution. The structure reveals a canonical USP-fold comprised of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains, as well as an unusual β-hairpin insertion. The catalytic triad of USP9X is aligned in an active configuration. USP9X is exclusively active against ubiquitin (Ub) but not Ub-like modifiers. Cleavage assays with di-, tri-, and tetraUb chains show that the USP9X catalytic domain has a clear preference for K11-, followed by K63-, K48-, and K6-linked polyUb chains. Using a set of activity-based diUb and triUb probes (ABPs), we demonstrate that the USP9X catalytic domain has an exo-cleavage preference for K48-and endo-cleavage preference for K11-linked polyUb chains. The structure model and biochemical data suggest that the USP9X catalytic domain harbors three Ub binding sites, and a zinc finger in the fingers subdomain and the β-hairpin insertion both play important roles in polyUb chain processing and linkage specificity. Furthermore, unexpected labeling of a secondary, noncatalytic cysteine located on a blocking loop adjacent to the catalytic site by K11-diUb ABP implicates a previously unreported mechanism of polyUb chain recognition. The structural features of USP9X revealed in our study are critical for understanding its DUB activity. The new Ub-based ABPs form a set of valuable tools to understand polyUb chain processing by the cysteine protease class of DUBs. deubiquitinase | activity-based probes | zinc finger | linkage specificity |","D eubiquitinases (DUBs) remove a key posttranslational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) from target proteins. Of the seven classes of DUBs, Ub-specific proteases (USPs) comprise the largest subfamily and account for over half of the DUBs encoded by the human genome (1) . The USPs are cysteine proteases characterized by a conserved USP catalytic domain (CD) fold, which resembles an overall hand-like structure with fingers, thumb, and palm subdomains. The core fold can be divided into six conserved boxes, where the N-terminal box 1 contains a Cys of the catalytic triad, and the C-terminal boxes 5 and 6 contain a His and an Asp/Asn residue, respectively (2) . The USP CD architecture is structurally conserved, although insertions at the loop regions between the boxes can drastically alter the size of the USP CDs (300-800 residues) (1-3)."
Molecular Characterization of Transcriptome-wide Interactions between Highly Pathogenic Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus and Porcine Alveolar Macrophages in vivo,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infects mainly the porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Previous studies have analyzed the global gene expression profiles of lung tissue in vivo and PAMs in vitro following infection with PRRSV, however, transcriptome-wide understanding of the interaction between highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) and PAMs in vivo has not yet been established. In this study, we employed Affymetrix microarrays to investigate the gene expression patterns of PAMs isolated from Tongcheng piglets (a Chinese indigenous breed) after infection with HP-PRRSV. During the infection, Tongcheng piglets exhibited typical clinical signs, e.g. fever, asthma, coughing, anorexia, lethargy and convulsion, but displayed mild regional lung damage at 5 and 7 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed that HP-PRRSV infection has affected PAMs in expression of the important genes involved in cytoskeleton and exocytosis organization, protein degradation and folding, intracellular calcium and zinc homeostasis. Several potential antiviral strategies might be employed in PAMs, including upregulating IFN-induced genes and increasing intracellular zinc ion concentration. And inhibition of the complement system likely attenuated the lung damage during HP-PRRSV infection. Transcriptomic analysis of PAMs in vivo could lead to a better understanding of the HP-PRRSV-host interaction, and to the identification of novel antiviral therapies and genetic components of swine tolerance/susceptibility to HP-PRRS.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) which belongs to the genus Arterivirus of the family Arteriviridae, is the most economically significant disease effecting commercially bred pigs world-wide [1] . This disease is characterized by anorexia, increased late-term Ivyspring International Publisher abortions, increased number of stillborn pigs, mummified fetuses, weak live-born piglets, increased pre-weaning mortality, and delayed return to estrus [2] . In vivo, PRRSV productive infection occurs predominately in alveolar macrophages of the lung [3] , followed by viremia and subsequent interstitial pneumonia within 3 days [4] . It was hypothesized that respiratory pathology, especially lung damage during PRRSV infection, results from an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs [5] ."
Risk factors for severe bronchiolitis caused by respiratory virus infections among Mexican children in an emergency department,Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization among children younger than 2 years. This study analyzed the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory virus infection and the risk factors for hospitalization of Mexican children with severe bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department.,"Bronchiolitis causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants and young children worldwide and is one of the most common clinical conditions treated by practicing pediatricians. [1] Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization of pediatric patients. This condition causes acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells; increased mucus production; and inadequate oxygenation of tissues, which can permanently damage the respiratory structures. In high-income countries, such as the United States, the number of hospitalizations for severe bronchiolitis have been estimated at 120,000 cases per year among infants, [2] and the proportion of hospitalizations have tripled between 1980 and 1996, from 5% to 16%. [3] In Spain, the incidence of bronchiolitis is estimated at 7%, and hospital admissions is estimated at 1.79% annually in children younger than 2 years. [4] However, in low/middle-income countries, the data on admissions of children with severe bronchiolitis and their outcomes are seldom up to date."
Article history: Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with COVID-19,"South Korea, and attempts have been made to isolate the pathogen from these patients. Methods: Upper and lower respiratory tract secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells to isolate the virus. Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to identify the virus. Results: The virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic effects were observed. Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homology of more than 99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated from patients from other countries, for instance China. Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively. Coronavirus-specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy in virus-infected Vero cells. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from putative patients with unexplained pneumonia and intermittent coughing and fever. The isolated virus was named BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020.","Coronavirus is an RNA virus consisting of positive-sense single-stranded RNA of approximately 27-32 kb.

Chloroquine use improves dengue-related symptoms,"Dengue is the most important arboviral disease in the world. As chloroquine, an antimalarial agent, has shown some antiviral effects, this study evaluated its effect in patients with dengue. A randomised, double-blind study was performed by administering chloroquine or placebo for three days to 129 patients with dengue-related symptoms. Of these patients, 37 were confirmed as having dengue and completed the study; in total, 19 dengue patients received chloroquine and 18 received placebo. There was no significant difference in the duration of the disease or the degree and days of fever. However, 12 patients (63%) with confirmed dengue reported a substantial decrease in pain intensity and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily activities (p = 0.0004) while on the medication and the symptoms returned immediately after these patients stopped taking the medication. The same effect was not observed in patients with diseases other than dengue. Therefore, this study shows that patients with dengue treated with chloroquine had an improvement in their quality of life and were able to resume their daily activities. However, as chloroquine did not alter the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever, further studies are necessary to confirm the clinical effects and to assess the side effects of chloroquine in dengue patients.","online | memorias.ioc.fiocruz.br Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Vol. 108(5) : 596-599, August 2013 Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral infection of humans and represents an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas.

It is reported that over 100 million people are infected with dengue viruses (DENV) every year; of these individuals, 500,000 develop a severe form, leading to approximately 20,000 deaths annually (Pinheiro & Corber 1997) ."
From the Ministry of Health,"To identify and describe the hospital disaster preparedness (HDP) in major private hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","which emergency medical services resources, such as personnel and equipment, are overwhelmed by the number and severity of casualties. 1 During recent decades, major emergencies, crises, terrorist attacks, and disasters are becoming a possibility in any community including Saudi community. These emergency incidents are affecting many people and causing MCIs. This can disrupt the health sector programs and essential services in the community. 2 Many lives could be saved if the affected communities were better prepared, with an organized scalable response system and emergency plans. Riyadh is not an exception and might be vulnerable to different types of MCIs. Riyadh is the capital of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and also its largest city with over 7 million populations that accounts for more than 22% of the population of the whole country. There are 11 governmental hospitals with more than 100 beds capacity in Riyadh. It is considered a strategic and economic requirement to make our hospitals and health facilities, including the private sector, prepared to emergency situations. 3 In Saudi Arabia most hospitals in Jeddah faced a critical situation in 2009 due to floods. This raised many questions in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and higher authorities about the preparedness of hospitals not in Jeddah area only, but also in the entire Kingdom. The role and importance of hospitals during disasters is essential to save as many lives as possible. 4 Emergency preparedness in the hospitals is a key success factor for any effective emergency and MCI management practices. In fact, hospitals play a significant role in health care infrastructure in a community. 5 Recently, Saudi Arabia has become a typical region for natural hazards (floods, storms, earthquake, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), landslides, and so forth) and/or human-made hazards (fires, explosives, structural collapse, transportation event, and so forth) that markedly could affect a large number of people. The MOH realized that making hospitals and health facilities safe from disasters is an essential strategic and economic requirement. The failure of hospitals to face disasters and MCIs and save lives cost KSA too high as compared to the cost of making hospitals safe and well prepared to face MCI. 6 The aim of this work was to investigate the hospital disaster preparedness (HDP) in 13 major Riyadh private hospitals in case of MCIs. Although there are controversies on the difference between disasters and MCI, the present study focused on having many casualties as sudden casualties of trauma only in urban healthcare system. Since there are no Saudi national standards for disaster management, this study was carried out as a part of MOH supervising the private hospitals to assess the current situation. This research was carried out as part of Master of Public Health (MPH) requirements and sponsored by the MOH. This study endeavored to establish a better knowledge about the capabilities of private hospitals in Riyadh to respond to MCIs that might occur."
Systems Biology-Based Platforms to Accelerate Research of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a major threat to public health and security. Given the dynamic nature and significant impact of EIDs, the most effective way to prevent and protect against them is to develop vaccines in advance. Systems biology approaches provide an integrative way to understand the complex immune response to pathogens. They can lead to a greater understanding of EID pathogenesis and facilitate the evaluation of newly developed vaccine-induced immunity in a timely manner. In recent years, advances in high throughput technologies have enabled researchers to successfully apply systems biology methods to analyze immune responses to a variety of pathogens and vaccines. Despite recent advances, computational and biological challenges impede wider application of systems biology approaches. This review highlights recent advances in the fields of systems immunology and vaccinology, and presents ways that systems biology-based platforms can be applied to accelerate a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immunity against EIDs.","Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are defined as newly appearing infections in a population or diseases that have previously existed, but are rapidly emerging in incidence or geographic range. 1, 2 EIDs are often initiated by pathogens with a change in pathogenicity, and these emerging pathogens are highly likely to be zoonotic, with a broad range of hosts or vector-borne. [3] [4] [5] New human pathogens are especially likely to continue emerging, mainly from mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, an effective global surveillance system for novel pathogens is needed. Due to the diverse nature of antigenic variation of emerging pathogens and their various strategies to evade the immune system, EIDs continue to pose difficult challenges to clinicians, public health profes-sionals, and researchers globally."
"Practice of Epidemiology Assessing Zika Virus Transmission Within Households During an Outbreak in Martinique, 2015-2016","Since 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused large epidemics in the Americas. Households are natural targets for control interventions, but quantification of the contribution of household transmission to overall spread is needed to guide policy. We developed a modeling framework to evaluate this contribution and key epidemic features of the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique in 2015-2016 from the joint analysis of a household transmission study (n = 68 households), a study among symptomatic pregnant women (n = 281), and seroprevalence surveys of blood donors (n = 457). We estimated that the probability of mosquito-mediated within-household transmission (from an infected member to a susceptible one) was 21% (95% credible interval (CrI): 5, 51), and the overall probability of infection from outside the household (i.e., in the community) was 39% (95% CrI: 27, 50). Overall, 50% (95% CrI: 43, 58) of the population was infected, with 22% (95% CrI: 5, 46) of infections acquired in households and 40% (95% CrI: 23, 56) being asymptomatic. The probability of presenting with Zika-like symptoms due to another cause was 16% (95% CrI: 10, 23). This study characterized the contribution of household transmission in ZIKV epidemics, demonstrating the benefits of integrating multiple data sets to gain more insight into epidemic dynamics. asymptomatic infections; final size model; household transmission; Zika virus Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; CrI, credible interval; ZIKV, Zika virus.","Initially submitted August 6, 2018; accepted for publication March 27, 2019."
A Global Perspective on Hepatitis B- Related Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Evolution During Human Migration,"Genome-wide association studies have indicated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP and HLA-DQ play roles in persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Asia. To understand the evolution of HBV-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to correlate these SNPs with chronic HBV infection among different populations, we conducted a global perspective study on hepatitis-related SNPs. We selected 12 HBV-related SNPs on the HLA locus and two HBV and three hepatitis C virus immune-related SNPs for analysis. Five nasopharyngeal carcinoma-related SNPs served as controls. All SNP data worldwide from 26 populations were downloaded from 1,000 genomes. We found a dramatic difference in the allele frequency in most of the HBV-and HLA-related SNPs in East Asia compared to the other continents. A sharp change in allele frequency in 8 of 12 SNPs was found between Bengali populations in Bangladesh and Chinese Dai populations in Xishuangbanna, China (P < 0.001); these areas represent the junction of South and East Asia. For the immune-related SNPs, significant changes were found after leaving Africa. Most of these genes shifted from higher expression genotypes in Africa to lower expression genotypes in either Europe or South Asia (P < 0.001). During this two-stage adaptation, immunity adjusted toward a weak immune response, which could have been a survival strategy during human migration to East Asia. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Africa is as high as in Asia; however, the HBV-related SNP genotypes are not present in Africa, and so the genetic mechanism of chronic HBV infection in Africa needs further exploration. Conclusion: Two stages of genetic changes toward a weak immune response occurred when humans migrated out of Africa. These changes could be a survival strategy for avoiding cytokine storms and surviving in new environments","C hronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global disease. The majority of carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are inhabitants of Africa and Asia. (1, 2) Immune tolerance is a hallmark of persistent HBV infection. (3) Typically, patients with chronic hepatitis B are infected through their parents in the early stage of life. (4) Remarkably, the immune system of the host may respond to the HBV (5) but does not produce the immune clearance of HBV. HBV may replicate in host cells peacefully until they enter immune clearance phases 2-4 decades later. (3) If the HBV can be eradicated, HBV replication will be terminated, and ultimately 50% of hosts may clear HBsAg by 80 years of age. (6) Genome-wide association studies from Asia have revealed that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP and HLA-DQ loci play roles in persistent HBV infection. (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) Our objective is to understand the evolution of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were responsible for HBV-related immune tolerance during human migration and to correlate the HBV-related SNPs with a prevalence of chronic HBV infection among global populations. Based on the data from 1,000 genomes collected worldwide, we conducted a global perspective study on the allele frequency of hepatitis-related SNPs."
Prevalence of diabetes in the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Over the past two decades a number of severe acute respiratory infection outbreaks such as the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have emerged and presented a considerable global public health threat. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that diabetic subjects are more susceptible to these conditions. However, the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV has not been systematically described. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV and compare its frequency in the two viral conditions. Meta-analysis for the proportions of subjects with diabetes was carried out in 29 studies for H1N1 (n=92,948) and 9 for MERS-CoV (n=308). Average age of H1N1 patients (36.2±6.0 years) was significantly younger than that of subjects with MERS-CoV (54.3±7.4 years, P<0.05). Compared to MERS-CoV patients, subjects with H1N1 exhibited 3-fold lower frequency of cardiovascular diseases and 2-and 4-fold higher prevalence of obesity and immunosuppression, respectively. The overall prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 was 14.6% (95% CI: 12.3-17.0%; P<0.001), a 3.6-fold lower than in P<0.001). The prevalence of diabetes among H1N1 cases from Asia and North America was ~two-fold higher than those from South America and Europe. The prevalence of diabetes in MERS-CoV cases is higher than in H1N1. Regional comparisons suggest that an etiologic role of diabetes in MERS-CoV may exist distinctive from that in H1N1.","For the past two decades, pandemics of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) have been serious threats to global health, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Reassorted novel strains of influenza viruses and coronaviruses continue to arise, rendering vaccinations -if developed -less useful and posing increased risks to humans. Two prominent viruses -2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -have markedly affected humans. H1N1, since the 2009 pandemic, has caused about 284,500 deaths, both directly via respiratory infections and indirectly from the cardiovascular diseases secondary to bacterial infections. 1 In addition, MERS-CoV, since its first emergence in 2012, has infected 1600 individuals, causing 574 deaths and was reported in 26 countries although the vast majority of reported cases originated from the Arabian Peninsula. 2 H1N1 and MERS-CoV both target the respiratory tract, and share many similar clinical symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat 3-8 followed always by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 3, [7] [8] [9] Both diseases often lead to complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, organ failure, and even death. 4, 6, 9 Complications mostly lie within the respiratory system with organ failure commonly noted in the respiratory system, followed by renal and cardiovascular systems. 5 Individuals infected with H1N1 usually belong to those aged between 21 and 50 years, 4, 5 and have a mean age in the early 40s. 3, 5 MERS-CoV, on the other hand, mostly infects older adults with a median age of 50 years. 10 This difference was hypothesized to be related to the development of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza viruses from previous exposures to seasonal influenza in elder people. 5 Another difference between H1N1 and MERS-CoV relates to the length of the incubation period. H1N1 has a short incubation period between 1 and 2 days, 11 whereas MERS-CoV has a much longer period of ~5 days. 10 Many infected individuals exhibit comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and obesity), rendering them more susceptible to complications. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Diabetes is one of the known documented contributing host-related risk factor in both H1N1 and MERS-CoV severe cases, and is frequent in individuals developing fatal disease complications. [4] [5] [6] [7] This observation may suggest an etiological relationship between diabetes and acute viral respiratory infections. Diabetes and its related conditions downregulate the innate and humoral immune systems by reducing the function of T cells and neutrophils. 12 Hyperglycemia impairs critical components of innate immunity in vitro, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages and lead to secondary infections. 13 The direct influence of diabetes, however, on acute respiratory infections"
MRPrimerV: a database of PCR primers for RNA virus detection,"To understand viral disease, detection and identification of these viruses are essential. Although PCR is widely used for rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, very few online database resources have compiled PCR primers for RNA viruses. To effectively detect viruses, the MRPrimerV database (http://MRPrimerV.com) contains 152 380 247 PCR primer pairs for detection of 1818 viruses, covering 7144 coding sequences (CDSs), representing 100% of the RNA viruses in the most up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database. Due to rigorous similarity testing against all human and viral sequences, every primer in MRPrimerV is highly target-specific. Because MR-PrimerV ranks CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer, users need only use the first primer pair for a single-phase PCR or the first two primer pairs for two-phase PCR. Moreover, MRPrimerV provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, covering 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses. We believe that the public availability of MRPrimerV will facilitate viral metagenomics studies aimed at evaluating the variability of viruses, as well as other scientific tasks.","Several fatal infectious diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), Ebola and Zika virus, have recently emerged around the world, and mortality rates are very high in patients who contract these illnesses (1) . Many infectious diseases are caused by viral infections, and in particular by RNA viruses. Detection and identification of these viruses are essential for understanding viral disease, and the accuracy and availability of tools designed for this purpose are crucial for effective and efficient virological studies."
A DNA biochip for on-the-spot multiplexed pathogen identification,"Miniaturized integrated DNA analysis systems have largely been based on a multi-chamber design with microfluidic control to process the sample sequentially from one module to another. This microchip design in connection with optics involved hinders the deployment of this technology for pointof-care applications. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of sample preparation, DNA amplification, and electrochemical detection in a single silicon and glass-based microchamber and its application for the multiplexed detection of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells. The microdevice has a thin-film heater and temperature sensor patterned on the silicon substrate. An array of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes was constructed within the microchamber as the transduction element. Oligonucleotide probes specific to the target amplicons are individually positioned at each ITO surface by electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and pyrroleÀprobe conjugate. These immobilized probes were stable to the thermal cycling process and were highly selective. The DNA-based identification of the two model pathogens involved a number of steps including a thermal lysis step, magnetic particle-based isolation of the target genomes, asymmetric PCR, and electrochemical sequence-specific detection using silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles. The microchamber platform described here offers a cost-effective and sampleto-answer technology for on-site monitoring of multiple pathogens.","Decentralized medical testing plays a vital role in today's health care system. The blood glucose meter, which was the first commercial handheld device for medical diagnostics and developed three decades ago, is by far one of the most successful examples in point-of-care testing (POCT). In the years to come, driven by the ever-growing threats from emerging infectious diseases (e.g. avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome), the development of small-size instruments for on-the-spot pathogen detection is expected to be an important segment of the POCT market. This trend has already commenced with a few companies having launched self-test products for hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus detection based on antibody-antigen interactions (e.g. OraSure Technologies and ACON Laboratories). These systems give a visual readout indicating the presence or absence of the target virus in $15 min. One of the main shortcomings of these immunological techniques is their limited sensitivity. To address this issue, there have been significant efforts to develop nucleic acid (NA)-based analyzers (1) (2) (3) . The miniaturization of NA analytical platforms has many advantages over the conventional bench-top counterparts. These include low sample/reagent consumption (volume of micro-down to picoliter) as well as short assay time (minutes rather than days). Most importantly, they permit the integration of a number of functions including sample preparation, target amplification, and product detection, thus enabling a fully automated operation that can be used by untrained individuals."

Concern over escape from a laboratory of a deadly human-contagious virus (e.g., influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] viruses) prompted the U.S. Government to hold back funding for this research ""until a robust and broad deliberative process (2) is completed that results in the adoption of a new USG gain-of-function research policy."" This discussion is now under way in the United States and is to be completed in 2016."
CD8 + T cells in Leishmania infections: friends or foes?,"Host protection against several intracellular pathogens requires the induction of CD8 + T cell responses. CD8 + T cells are potent effector cells that can produce high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and kill infected target cells efficiently. However, a protective role for CD8 + T cells during Leishmania infections is still controversial and largely depends on the infection model. In this review, we discuss the role of CD8 + T cells during various types of Leishmania infections, following vaccination, and as potential immunotherapeutic targets.","CD8 + T cells play a major role in protective immunity to a wide variety of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites. However, the protective role of CD8 + T cells during Leishmania infections has been controversial, mainly because of the discrepancy among infections with different Leishmania species. Different Leishmania species have different tropisms and their diversity is reflected in the various clinical manifestations they induce. Hence, it is not surprising that the contribution of CD8 + T cells to the immune response against the parasite depends on the clinical form and the species that is causing it. Here, we discuss the literature on the contribution of CD8 + T cells to the immune response against Leishmania, taking into account the various clinical forms and experimental models."
and Primary Health Care,"Background: Hand hygiene is one of the essential means to prevent the spread of infections. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of hand hygiene in primary care settings. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a self-reported questionnaire was conducted in primary care settings located in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, under the service of King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). The Institutional Review Board of KAMC Research Centre approved the study. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software. Results: A total of 237 participants were included in the analysis. Participants who received hand hygiene training within the last 3 years (2012Á2014) scored higher on a knowledge scale. Generally, there was an overall positive attitude from participants toward hand hygiene practice. In total, 87.54% acknowledged that they routinely used alcohol-based hand rub, 87.4% had sufficiently decontaminated hands even under high work pressure, and 78.6% addressed that this practice was not affected by less compliant colleagues. Conclusion: Practicing hand hygiene was suggested to be influenced by variables related to the environmental context, social pressure, and individual attitudes toward hand hygiene. We believe that addressing beliefs, attitudes, capacity, and supportive infrastructures to sustain hand-hygiene routine behaviors are important components of an implementation strategy in enhancing health care workers' KAP of hand hygiene.","H ealth care-associated infections are one of the most important public health problems in many countries, resulting in an increase in the morbidity, mortality, and additional costs in health care settings (1Á3). Hand hygiene is one of the essential means to prevent the spread of such infections. In 1983, Semmelweis highlighted that cleansing contaminated hands with antiseptic products before and after contact with patients may reduce health care-associated infections (4) . Thereafter, CDC published the first formal guidelines on handwashing practices in hospitals (5) , followed by guidelines from the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) (6) ."

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Tertiary health care hospital in central Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A self-administered survey was utilized to collect data from ED physicians and nurses. The questionnaire was divided into 5 sections viz; demographics, knowledge about disaster management and preparedness, attitudes about disaster planning, current role and practices, and familiarity towards emergency.","D isaster refers to a significant functional deterioration or loss of life, material, economy or environmental resources. 1 The magnitude, frequency, and type of disaster events vary as per to the geographical location, ethnicities, and economic capacities. 2 Natural and human-induced disasters befall every day throughout the biosphere and cause catastrophic impacts on public health in terms of injuries, sufferings, deaths, destruction of infrastructure, and facility. 2 Conferring to the World Disasters Report (2016), earthquakes, landslides, floods, and heat waves led to 574 reported disasters and had resulted of 32,550 human deaths. In 2015, the majority if disasters' deaths (67% of the global deaths) were in Asia, and it was beyond 50.5% of the decade's annual average. 3 The occurrence of multiple casualty incidents (MCIs), such as swine flu pandemics had transformed healthcare workers' perception towards disaster preparedness. Countries were encouraged to respond to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) request to take up major steps to ensure safe health care facilities during the emergency. Such response must include evaluation of hospital safety; training and protection of health personnel for emergencies; planning a strategy to handle an emergency; designing and building durable hospitals; adopting national programs and policies; and protecting medical and ordinary equipment, materials, and supplies. 4, 5 During and after the catastrophic disasters, hospitals are considered as the safest environment for people as they provide vital care to the casualties. The unpredictable disasters and the multifacet damages warrant the healthcare providers to be prepared and handle the victims with various capabilities and care, to lessen the impact of disasters. 6, 7 Moreover, they need to play a crucial role in emergency preparedness and disaster response plan. This would confirm their personnel readiness for disaster from the beginning. Such a readiness may be achieved throughout the periodic training and mock codes, in addition to being aware of any changes or updates in the standing disaster management guidelines. 8 Despite improved public awareness towards the MCIs, threat and various guidelines recommended for hospital disaster plans by several agencies, the emphasis on preparing healthcare workforce for such disasters is inadequate. 9, 10 Specifically, the majority of the reported data on disaster preparedness is based on the literature of systems-level responses rather than institutional and individual responses. 10 Physicians and nurses comprise the highest percentage of health and medical workforce. They must understand the national disaster management cycle. Without their integration at every phase, communities and clients lose a critical part of prevention network. A previous study assessing the knowledge and skills among emergency nurses showed that they were confident in terms of disaster handling, but they were not trained for the same. 11 Another study was performed on nurses reported average percentage scores in the domains of knowledge, attitudes and practice towords disaster and emergency preparedness. 12 A growing number of studies in the literature reported facts about Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's disaster management and preparedness. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Bajow et al, 20 evaluated hospital disaster preparedness in Jeddah region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and showed that although study hospital had the tools and quality indicators for emergency preparedness, staff are lacking the proper training and management of disaster. Moreover, quite a few studies have reported variety in staff knowledge, training and education regarding preparedness for disaster emergency incidents. [14] [15] [16] 19, 21 Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, practices, and attitudes regarding disaster and emergency preparedness among ED staff at a tertiary health care hospital."

Type I interferon protects neurons from prions in in vivo models,"Infectious prions comprising abnormal prion protein, which is produced by structural conversion of normal prion protein, are responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Prions are infectious agents that do not possess a genome and the pathogenic protein was not thought to evoke any immune response. Although we previously reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, suggesting the protective role of host innate immune responses mediated by IRF3 signalling, this remained to be clarified. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interactions of type I interferon evoked by IRF3 activation and prion infection and found that infecting prions cause the suppression of endogenous interferon expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant interferons in an ex vivo model was able to inhibit prion infection. In addition, cells and mice deficient in type I interferon receptor (subunit interferon alpha/beta receptor 1), exhibited higher susceptibility to 22L-prion infection. Moreover, in in vivo and ex vivo prion-infected models, treatment with RO8191, a selective type I interferon receptor agonist, inhibited prion invasion and prolonged the survival period of infected mice. Taken together, these data indicated that the interferon signalling interferes with prion propagation and some interferon-stimulated genes might play protective roles in the brain. These findings may allow for the development of new strategies to combat fatal diseases.","Human prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders for which no effective treatment is currently available. Prions are proteinaceous infectious pathogens distinct from bacteria or viruses. Accumulation of the structurally abnormal prion protein (PrP Sc ) causes pathological changes such as neuronal death in the brain, resulting in rapidly progressive cognitive disorders. PrP Sc , which is highly enriched in b-sheet secondary structures, causes misfolding of normal cellular PrP (PrP C ) (Prusiner, 1998; Weissmann et al., 2002) . In a widely-accepted model of the molecular mechanism of prion pathogenesis, following the expression or introduction of PrP Sc , the pathogenic proteins accumulate in and on neurons; subsequently, various inflammatory responses occur and induce neuronal death (Tamguney et al., 2008; Aguzzi et al., 2013) . One pathological feature associated with prion infection is widespread diffuse gliosis. However, the host-pathogen interaction in these diseases remains incompletely understood."
Cloning whole bacterial genomes in yeast,"Most microbes have not been cultured, and many of those that are cultivatable are difficult, dangerous or expensive to propagate or are genetically intractable. Routine cloning of large genome fractions or whole genomes from these organisms would significantly enhance their discovery and genetic and functional characterization. Here we report the cloning of whole bacterial genomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as single-DNA molecules. We cloned the genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium (0.6 Mb), M. pneumoniae (0.8 Mb) and M. mycoides subspecies capri (1.1 Mb) as yeast circular centromeric plasmids. These genomes appear to be stably maintained in a host that has efficient, well-established methods for DNA manipulation.","DNA cloning is a defining technique of modern molecular biology. Generally, cloned DNA contains no more than a few genes. Recently, there has been increasing interest in cloning much larger pieces of DNA, including whole genomes. For example, several organelle genomes have been cloned. The 16-kb mouse mitochondrial genome has been cloned in Escherichia coli (1, 2) , Bacillus subtilis (1,3) and yeast (4) . The 139-kb maize chloroplast genome has been cloned in yeast (5) , and the 135-kb rice chloroplast genome has been cloned in B. subtilis (1) . Viral genomes have been cloned in E. coli, including those from a number of herpesviruses (6) as well as baculoviruses (7) (8) (9) , coronaviruses (10) and a poxvirus (11) . A 36-kb human adenovirus type 2 genome (12) and a 178-kb fragment of the human cytomegalovirus genome (13) have been cloned in yeast.

PGHN Case Report Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis Associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infection in a Child,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 20% to 30% of community-acquired pneumonia, and is well known for its diverse extrapulmonary manifestations. However, acute necrotizing pancreatits is an extremely rare extrapulmonary manifestation of M. pneumoniae infection. A 6-year-old girl was admitted due to abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, and confused mentality. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was diagnosed according to symptoms, laboratory test results, and abdominal computed tomography scans. M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed by a 4-fold increase in antibodies to M. pneumoniae between acute and convalescent sera by particle agglutination antibody assay. No other etiologic factors or pathogens were detected. Despite the occurrence of a large infected pseudocyst during the course, the patient was able to discharge without morbidity by early aggressive supportive care. This is the first case in Korea of a child with acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with M. pneumoniae infection.","Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can cause a number of extrapulmonary manifestations, even in the absence of pneumonia. Extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection notably involve the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, heart, joints, skin, and blood cells. Especially, gastrointestinal manifestations account for 25% of M. pneu-moniae infections, which produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. However, acute pancreatitis is rarely associated with M. pneumoniae infection, with scarce reports and studies in literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . We report the first case in Korea of a child with acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with M. pneumoniae infection."
Global Health and Foreign Policy,"Health has long been intertwined with the foreign policies of states. In recent years, however, global health issues have risen to the highest levels of international politics and have become accepted as legitimate issues in foreign policy. This elevated political priority is in many ways a welcome development for proponents of global health, and it has resulted in increased funding for and attention to select global health issues. However, there has been less examination of the tensions that characterize the relationship between global health and foreign policy and of the potential effects of linking global health efforts with the foreign-policy interests of states. In this paper, the authors review the relationship between global health and foreign policy by examining the roles of health across 4 major components of foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. For each of these aspects of foreign policy, the authors review current and historical issues and discuss how foreign-policy interests have aided or impeded global health efforts. The increasing relevance of global health to foreign policy holds both opportunities and dangers for global efforts to improve health.","Global health issues have long been a concern for foreignpolicy-makers. From sanitary cordons instituted to prevent plague from entering Croatia's Dalmatian Coast to the international sanitary conventions, which began in 1851, to the victories over malaria and yellow fever that permitted the construction of the strategic Panama Canal, health and disease have been intertwined with the pursuit of foreignpolicy interests. However, over the last 2 decades, globalization has made global health more relevant across multiple aspects of foreign policy than ever before. Fidler calls this a ''revolution'' in the political status of global health, noting that ''nothing in the prior history of national and international efforts on public health compares to the political status public health has reached today'' (1, p. 45) ."

Yet the effects of cortisone, cytoxan, and epierythrozoon in vitro are minimal or absent. However, experiments reported here have shown that certain substances (lymphokines) in supernatant fluid from allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) rendered the macrophages of C3H mice susceptible to MHV. Fluid derived from congenic MLC did not change the resistance of C3H macrophages to the virus.",Experiments were designed to test whether substances elaborated by MLC into the culture fluid would influence the susceptibility of resistant macrophages to MHV-PRI and whether direct cell-to-cell contact was necessary.
The Importance of Virology at a Time of Great Need and Great Jeopardy,"Citation Imperiale MJ, Casadevall A. 2015. The importance of virology at a time of great need and great jeopardy. mBio 6(2):e00236-15.","A s we enter 2015, one needs to look no farther than the daily news reports to appreciate the ongoing burden of viral diseases. Last year, Ebola reemerged in West Africa, claiming thousands of lives and affecting many thousands more. Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) continue to be reported, with the possibility of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like epidemic ever present. Chikungunya virus has spread to the Western Hemisphere, and the infection is now epidemic in the Caribbean and southern United States. We are also living in a world in which hundreds of millions of people are chronically infected with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively). The rate of new HIV infections has declined, but millions remain infected, and it, too, has already cut short far too many lives. Viruses account for up to 20% of all human cancers, and although a large percentage of new human papillomavirus (HPV) and HBV infections can now be prevented by vaccination, many are already infected, and the vaccines are not being used to their full potential. We are in the middle of our annual encounter with influenza virus, never knowing when the next strain to which there is little or no preexisting immunity will arise. In 2014-2015, a mismatch between the H3N2 strain in the influenza vaccine and the circulating virus has led to a poorly protective vaccine, which highlights the need for new vaccines. In recent months, there has been a recurrence of measles in the United States associated with a refusal by some parents to vaccinate their children, and the outbreak continues at the time of this writing (1). This accounting is of only some viruses and is limited to those that infect humans! There can be no argument that humankind's best hope of preventing and treating these diseases comes from a vigorous research enterprise. Vannevar Bush recognized this after World War II in the landmark report ""Science, the Endless Frontier,"" in which he convinced the U.S. government that investment in basic research at universities would yield tremendous dividends (https:// www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm). Indeed, we have now almost eliminated polio due to the development of vaccines and have converted HIV infection from a certain death sentence to a largely manageable state, and, as mentioned above, we have our first anticancer vaccines by preventing some viral infections. The tremendous reduction in mortality from such diseases as variola, measles, and rubella came about only because the causative viruses were identified, cultivated, attenuated, and made into effective vaccines by biomedical research. In addition to having applied these practical findings, we have gained important fundamental insights into the biology not only of viruses but also of the cells that they infect, and that information is being applied to find cures against other diseases, such as cancer. All these advances, and more, have come about because of public trust in science and investment in scientific research."
Genomic Characterization of a Newly Discovered Coronavirus Associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Humans,"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC/2012) was isolated from a man with acute pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012. This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/ 2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome",". Coronaviruses are assigned to a genus on the basis of rooted phylogeny and calculation of pairwise evolutionary distances for seven highly conserved domains in the replicase polyprotein (1, 21) (C. Lauber and A. E. Gorbalenya, unpublished data). HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are viruses belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus (1) . Four monophyletic lineages (A through D) with no formal taxonomic standing, some of them encompassing multiple virus species, are commonly recognized within the genus Betacoronavirus. Lineage A includes HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 and lineage B SARS-CoV, all of which belong to different species. Lineages C and D include viruses detected only in bats, such as Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (BtCoV-HKU9) (lineage D), Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4), and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5) (both lineage C) (1) . The genetic diversity of coronaviruses is likely facilitated by a high frequency of RNA recombination and the ability of their unusually large RNA genomes to both gain and lose domains (1, 22, 23) . These factors are believed to have promoted the emergence of viruses with novel traits that are able to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches, sometimes causing zoonotic events."
"PtK1 Cells Contain a Nonditfusible, Dominant Factor That Makes the Golgi Apparatus Resistant to Brefeldin A","Brefeldin A (BFA) was shown in earlier studies of numerous cell types to inhibit secretion, in-","Abstract. Brefeldin A (BFA) was shown in earlier studies of numerous cell types to inhibit secretion, induce enzymes of the Golgi stacks to redistribute into the ER, and to cause the Golgi cisternae to disappear. Here, we demonstrate that the PtKt line of rat kangaroo kidney cells is resistant to BFA. The drug did not disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex in PtKt cells, as judged by immunofluorescence using antibodies to 58-(58K) and l l0-kD (B-COP) Golgi proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy of live cells labeled with C6-NBD-ceramide. In addition, BFA did not inhibit protein secretion, not alter the kinetics or extent of glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G-protein) in VSV-infected PtKt cells. To explore the mechanism of resistance to BFA, PtKt cells were fused with BFA-sensitive CV-1 cells that had been infected with a recombinant SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G-protein and, at various times following fusion, the cultures were exposed to BFA. Shortly after cell fusion, heterokaryons contained one Golgi complex associated with each nu-cleus. Golgi membranes derived from CV-1 cells were sensitive to BFA, whereas those of PtKt origin were BFA resistant. A few hours after fusion, most heterokaryons contained a single, large Golgi apparatus that was resistant to BFA and contained CV-1 galactosyltransferase. In unfused cells that had been perforated using nitrocellulose filters, retention of/3-COP on the Golgi was optimal in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and GTE In perforated cell models of the BFAsensitive MA104 line, BFA caused 3-COP to be released from the Golgi complex in the presence of nucleotides, and either MA104 or PtK~ cytosol. In contrast, when perforated PtKl cells were incubated with BFA, nucleotides, and cytosol from either cell type, ~-COP remained bound to the Golgi complex. We conclude that PtKl cells contain a nondiffusible factor, which is located on or very close to the Golgi complex, and confers a dominant resistance to BFA. It is possible that this factor is homologous to the target of BFA in cells that are sensitive to the drug."
trans-Golgl Retention of a Plasma Membrane Protein: Mutations in the Cytoplasmic Domain of the Asialoglycoprotein Receptor Subunit H1 Result in trans-Golgl Retention,"Unlike the wild-type asialoglycoprotein receptor subunit H1 which is transported to the cell surface, endocytosed and recycled, a mutant lacking residues 4-33 of the 40--amino acid cytoplasmic domain was found to be retained intracellularly upon expression in different cell lines. The mutant protein accumulated in the trans-Golgi, as judged from the acquisition of trans-Golgi-specific modifications of the protein and from the immunofluorescence staining pattern. It was localized to juxtanuclear, tubular structures that were also stained by antibodies against galactosyltransferase and -y-adaptin. The results of further mutagenesis in the cytoplasmic domain indicated that the size rather than the specific sequence of the cytoplasmic domain deter-mines whether H1 is retained in the trans-Golgi or transported to the cell surface. Truncation to less than 17 residues resulted in retention, and extension of a truncated tail by an unrelated sequence restored surface transport. The transmembrane segment of H1 was not sufficient for retention of a reporter molecule and it could be replaced by an artificial apolar sequence without affecting Golgi localization. The cytoplasmic domain thus appears to inhibit interaction(s) of the exoplasmic portion of H1 with trans-Golgi component(s)","T RANSPORT of proteins through the secretory pathway appears to occur by default (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . In contrast, localization to individual compartments (by retention or retrieval) requires specific signals (Pelham and Munro, 1993) , such as the carboxy-terminal sequence KDEL and the cytoplasmic motif K(X)KXX for retrieval to the ER of lumenal and membrane proteins, respectively. The determinants for retention in Golgi compartments have so far been shown to comprise the transmembrane domain with or without flanking sequences. Proteins leaving the Golgi apparatus are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) largely by signal-dependent mechanisms into specific transport vesicles to secretory granules, apical or basolateral plasma membrane, or endosomes."
UA information,"Viral respiratory infections are frequently eliminated from human bodies without any sequelae. Secondary serious bacterial infection (SBI) in children with acute bronchiolitis has been an apprehension expressed by health care providers.

However, the proposed mechanism by which a virus can induce UTIs is not yet known. The aim of this commentary is to update the current evidence of risk of UTI in children with bronchiolitis. We present several clinical studies related to the topic as well as a brief review of the potential pathophysiology of secondary infections that could present with viral respiratory illness.","Viral respiratory infections are frequently eliminated from human bodies without any sequelae. Nevertheless, in some occasions viruses can evade the immune reaction of the airways, leading to austere respiratory diseases. 1 Potent mechanical and immunosuppressive methods protect the lungs against external infections, but a solitary respiratory tract infection can change immunity and pathology. 2 Secondary serious bacterial infection (SBI) in children with acute bronchiolitis has been an apprehension expressed by health care providers. 3 Several published studies have shown an association between acute bronchiolitis and secondary bacterial infection, including urinary tract infections (UTI).

Article Critical role of phospholipase A 2 group IID in age-related susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV infection,"Oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation in the lungs are associated with aging and may contribute to age-related immune dysfunction. To maintain lung homeostasis, chronic inflammation is countered by enhanced expression of proresolving/antiinflammatory factors. Here, we show that age-dependent increases of one such factor in the lungs, a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) group IID (PLA 2 G2D) with antiinflammatory properties, contributed to worse outcomes in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Strikingly, infection of mice lacking PLA 2 G2D expression (Pla2g2d / mice) converted a uniformly lethal infection to a nonlethal one (>80% survival), subsequent to development of enhanced respiratory DC migration to the draining lymph nodes, augmented antivirus T cell responses, and diminished lung damage. We also observed similar effects in influenza A virus-infected middle-aged Pla2g2d / mice. Furthermore, oxidative stress, probably via lipid peroxidation, was found to induce PLA 2 G2D expression in mice and in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Thus, our results suggest that directed inhibition of a single inducible phospholipase, PLA 2 G2D, in the lungs of older patients with severe respiratory infections is potentially an attractive therapeutic intervention to restore immune function.","Aging is associated with a decline in immune function, generally termed immunosenescence (Caruso et al., 2009; Cannizzo et al., 2011) , which in turn is often linked to age-related increases in oxidative stress (De La Fuente and Miquel, 2009) . Oxidative stress associated with aging has been attributed to the initiation and maintenance of chronic low-grade inflammation (""inflammaging""; Cannizzo et al., 2011) . A consequence of immunosenescence is that many viral infections are more severe in aged individuals (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Assiri et al., 2013; Saad et al., 2014; Alsolamy, 2015) . Agedependent changes in susceptibility are especially striking in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses (SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV). In the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, all patients under 24 yr of age survived, whereas 6, 15, and >50% of patients aged 25-44, 45-64, and >65 yr of age, respectively, succumbed to the infection, with many developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (Donnelly et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003; Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . This marked age-dependent increase in mortality is also observed in mice and nonhuman primates infected with SARS-CoV (Nagata et al., 2008; Day et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2012) . For example, 6-10-wk-old C57BL/6 mice are highly resistant to SARS-CoV and remain asymptomatic even in the absence of interferon signaling (Frieman et al., 2010) , whereas as mice age from for maintaining lung homeostasis and for prostaglandin production, we initially examined CD11c + cells harvested from young and middle-aged mice for global changes in gene expression. Expression levels of 186 genes changed during aging, with many involved in antigen presentation and inflammation ( Fig. 1 B and Table S1 ). Many of these were predicted to contribute to a chronic inflammatory response. However, our previous study showed that levels of a prostaglandin with antiinflammatory properties, PGD 2 , were elevated in aged mice (confirmed in Fig. 1 A) and contributed to poor outcomes after SARS-CoV infection (Zhao et al., 2011) . Therefore, we next focused on genes involved in the AA pathway, including several phospholipases, cyclooxygenases, and synthases, which could modulate PGD 2 levels in the lungs. Of all the genes in the AA cascade, only levels of secreted phospholipase A 2 group IID (PLA 2 G2D) were significantly higher in CD11c + cells in the lungs of middle-aged compared with young mice (using twofold differences as a cutoff; Fig. 1 , C and D). We confirmed these results by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses of CD11c + cell RNA by separating CD11c + and CD11c  cells from the lungs of naive young and middle-aged mice using magnetic beads and quantifying the expression of PLA 2 G2D mRNA (Fig. 2 A) . We observed 25-30 fold higher expression of PLA 2 G2D mRNA in lung CD11c + compared with CD11c  cells from middle-aged mice. Comparison of CD11c + cells from young and middle-aged mice revealed that PLA 2 G2D was expressed at levels >50-fold higher in middleaged mice (Fig. 2 A) . Flow cytometric analysis also showed higher expression of PLA 2 G2D in CD11c + compared with CD11c  cells on a per cell basis in both young and middle-aged mice, as measured by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI; Fig. 2 B ). In addition, middle-aged mice harbored a higher frequency of CD11c + cells expressing PLA 2 G2D compared with young mice (Fig. 2 C) ."
"PEX19 Binds Multiple Peroxisomal Membrane Proteins, Is Predominantly Cytoplasmic, and Is Required for Peroxisome Membrane Synthesis","Peroxisomes are components of virtually all eukaryotic cells. While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.","The elaborate architecture of eukaryotic cells allows for the concentration of integrated biochemical functions, the segregation of competing metabolic processes, and the creation of unique chemical environments. How the cell assembles and maintains this complex array of subcellular organelles is a central issue in cell biology. It is also a critical subject of evolutionary biology given that the genesis of each organelle represents a watershed event in the evolution of eukaryotic life. The peroxisome is a ubiquitous organelle of eukaryotic cells that participates in a wide variety of metabolic processes (Wanders and Tager, 1998) . However, the mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis has yet to be elucidated, and there is no cogent model for the genesis of this organelle."
"Emerging Microbes and Infections (2012) 1, e13","A number of emerging and re-emerging viruses have caused epidemics or pandemics of infectious diseases leading to major devastations throughout human history. Therefore, developing effective and safe vaccines against these viruses is clearly important for the protection of at-risk populations. Our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a key target for the development of SARS vaccines. In this review, we highlight some key advances in the development of antiviral vaccines targeting the RBDs of spike proteins of emerging and re-emerging viruses, using SARS-CoV, influenza virus, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) as examples. Figure 1 The interaction between the receptor-binding domain in the spike of an emerging virus and the corresponding receptor on the target cell.","Epidemics and pandemics of emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 1-3 influenza virus, 4 Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), 5, 6 have posed a great threat to public health, human safety and economic stability worldwide. Therefore, development of effective and safe vaccines to prevent these diseases is urgently needed."
Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism Is a Disease Related to Infection and Immune Dysfunction,"The characteristics of human genomics and cellular immune function between clinically symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and controls were systematically compared to explore the immunologic pathogenesis of VTE. Microarray assay showed the mRNA expressions of genes related to non-specific cellarer immune and cytokines were significantly down-regulated. Abnormal expressions of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK marker CD16+56+, CD19 and aberrant CD4+/CD8+ ratio were detected in 54 among 56 patients. In PE patients, microarray assay revealed the imbalance in the expressions of genes related to the immune system. The expressions of genes related to non-specific immune cells and cytokines were markedly up-regulated and those associated with cellular immune were dramatically down-regulated. In VTE patients, cytological examination indicated the functions of NK cells were significantly compromised, and the antigen recognition and killing function of T cells markedly decreased. The consistence between genomic and cytological examination suggests the symptomatic VTE is closely associated with the infection and immune dysfunction.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including acute pulmonary embolism (APE), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a global disease. The high morbidity, high misdiagnosis rate and high mortality render PE as a worldwide health problem (1) . In 1965, Egeberg et al first described a parentage with inherited antithrombin deficiency, a member of which repeatedly developed DVT. The antithrombin deficiency is an autosomal dominant genetic disease and they first proposed the concept of thrombophilia (2) . However, evidence on the genetic pathogenesis of VTE is rarely identified in a majority of VTE patients (3) . According to the pathogenesis, VTE is classified into genetic VTE and acquired VTE which is frequently found in clinical practice. The symptomatic VTE is an entity of hereditary VTE and acquired VTE."
Inhibition of HIV-1 by multiple siRNAs expressed from a single microRNA polycistron,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful approach to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. However, HIV-1 can escape from RNAimediated antiviral therapy by selection of mutations in the targeted sequence. To prevent viral escape, multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against conserved viral sequences should be combined. Ideally, these RNA inhibitors should be expressed simultaneously from a single transgene transcript.","RNAi is an evolutionary conserved and sequence-specific gene silencing mechanism in eukaryotes (1, 2) . RNAi can be induced by double-stranded RNA that is processed by the RNase III-like enzyme Dicer into 21-25 bp siRNAs (3) (4) (5) . The siRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm and directs RISC to degrade an mRNA that is perfectly complementary to one (guide) strand of the siRNA (5) ."
Lectin Switching During Dengue Virus Infection,"Dengue virus receptors are relatively poorly characterized, but there has been recent interest in 2 C-type lectin molecules, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its close homologue liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN), which can both bind dengue and promote infection. In this report we have studied the interaction of dengue viruses produced in insect cells, tumor cell lines, and primary human dendritic cells (DCs) with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Virus produced in primary DCs is unable to interact with DC-SIGN but remains infectious for L-SIGNexpressing cells. Skin-resident DCs may thus be a site of initial infection by insect-produced virus, but DCs will likely not participate in large-scale virus replication during dengue infection. These results reveal that differential glycosylation of dengue virus envelope protein is highly dependent on cell state and suggest that studies of virus tropism using virus prepared in insect cells or tumor cell lines should be interpreted with caution.","The global prevalence of the dengue virus (DENV) has grown dramatically in recent decades, and it is now endemic in .100 countries, with some 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. Dengue is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that can be subdivided into the 4 major serotypes (DEN-1-DEN-4). Most dengue infections either are asymptomatic or lead to a self-limiting febrile illness, dengue fever. In some cases the illness is more severe, leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with severe plasma leakage and bleeding that can be life threatening."
Stem-loop structures can effectively substitute for an RNA pseudoknot in À1 ribosomal frameshifting,"À1 Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) in synthesizing the gag-pro precursor polyprotein of Simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) is stimulated by a classical H-type pseudoknot which forms an extended triple helix involving base-base and base-sugar interactions between loop and stem nucleotides. Recently, we showed that mutation of bases involved in triple helix formation affected frameshifting, again emphasizing the role of the triple helix in À1 PRF. Here, we investigated the efficiency of hairpins of similar base pair composition as the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot. Although not capable of triple helix formation they proved worthy stimulators of frameshifting. Subsequent investigation of $30 different hairpin constructs revealed that next to thermodynamic stability, loop size and composition and stem irregularities can influence frameshifting. Interestingly, hairpins carrying the stable GAAA tetraloop were significantly less shifty than other hairpins, including those with a UUCG motif. The data are discussed in relation to natural shifty hairpins.","Ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding event in which a certain percentage of ribosomes are forced to shift to another reading frame in order to synthesize an alternative protein. This switch occurs at a specific position on the mRNA, called the slip site or slippery sequence, and can be either forwards (+1) or backwards (À1). The nature and efficiency of frameshifting depends on several factors, including tRNA availability and modifications, and mRNA primary and secondary structure (1, 2) ."
Genome-Wide Gene Expression Analysis Identifies the Proto-oncogene Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Src as a Crucial Virulence Determinant of Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus in Chicken Cells,"Given the side effects of vaccination against infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), novel strategies for ILT control and therapy are urgently needed. The modulation of host-virus interactions is a promising strategy to combat the virus; however, the interactions between the host and avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) are unclear. Using genome-wide transcriptome studies in combination with a bioinformatic analysis, we identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) to be an important modulator of ILTV infection. Src controls the virulence of ILTV and is phosphorylated upon ILTV infection. Functional studies revealed that Src prolongs the survival of host cells by increasing the threshold of virus-induced cell death. Therefore, Src is essential for viral replication in vitro and in ovo but is not required for ILTV-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results identify a positive-feedback loop between Src and the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is necessary for the phosphorylation of either Src or FAK and is required for Src to modulate ILTV infection. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify a key host regulator controlling host-ILTV interactions. We believe that our findings have revealed a new potential therapeutic target for ILT control and therapy.","I nfectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a major respiratory disease of chickens that is induced by avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV; also known as gallid herpesvirus 1). ILTV belongs to the Iltovirus genus within the Herpesviridae family. Infection with ILTV can induce a mild to severe upper respiratory tract disease in chickens, depending on the virulence of the virus, and it causes large economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide annually. Vaccination using live attenuated virus has been the most commonly used method to control ILT outbreaks since the mid-20th century. Vaccination infects naive chickens with live attenuated virus, thereby establishing latent viral carriers; however, it is not recommended that this vaccine be used in regions where ILT outbreaks are absent (1) (2) (3) (4) . The majority of currently used live attenuated virus vaccines can induce successful protection in chickens (5) . New outbreaks of ILT are continually being identified in many countries, especially in regions where live attenuated vaccines have been extensively administered (6) . A growing body of evidence from molecular typing data collected worldwide has revealed that the currently used live attenuated vaccine strains could generate, via recombination, a virulent virus that could be the cause of current outbreaks (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Increasing concerns regarding the biosafety of live attenuated ILTV vaccines have triggered the development of recombinant vaccines using viral vectors, and these have been released in some countries (6) . However, none of the currently available recombinant vaccines are able to clear latent virus from an infected host. As a consequence, a residual latent infection can induce new outbreaks under certain conditions when host immunity is compromised, such as under stress and at the onset of egg laying (13, 14) . Therefore, novel strategies that are independent of the host immune system, such as tighter farm biosecurity and anti-ILTV breeding, are required to control ILT outbreaks. It is hoped that these new strategies that are being developed will improve the control of ILT and reduce the extensive use of live attenuated virus as vaccines."
Article EndoU is a novel regulator of AICD during peripheral B cell selection,"Balanced transmembrane signals maintain a competent peripheral B cell pool limited in selfreactive B cells that may produce pathogenic autoantibodies. To identify molecules regulating peripheral B cell survival and tolerance to self-antigens (Ags), a gene modifier screen was performed with B cells from CD22-deficient C57BL/6 (CD22 /[B6] ) mice that undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD) and fail to up-regulate c-Myc expression after B cell Ag receptor ligation. Likewise, lysozyme auto-Ag-specific B cells in Ig Tg hen egg lysozyme (HEL) transgenic mice inhabit the spleen but undergo AICD after auto-Ag encounter. This gene modifier screen identified EndoU, a single-stranded RNA-binding protein of ancient origin, as a major regulator of B cell survival in both models. EndoU gene disruption prevents AICD and normalizes c-Myc expression. These findings reveal that EndoU is a critical regulator of an unexpected and novel RNA-dependent pathway controlling peripheral B cell survival and Ag responsiveness that may contribute to peripheral B cell tolerance.","Molecules that regulate lymphocyte homeostasis, proliferation, and survival operate in concert to enable robust adaptive immune responses to foreign antigens (Ags). For the B cell lineage, the optimal outcome of these processes is a diverse antibody (Ab) repertoire purged of pathological (self-reactive) B cells. The elimination of pathological B cells occurs either through clonal deletion or receptor editing during B lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow, or in the periphery through the induction of anergy (Goodnow et al., 1988; Nemazee and Bürki, 1989; Gay et al., 1993; Tiegs et al., 1993) . Anergic B cells primarily inhabit the spleen, are short-lived, and undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD) in response to B cell Ag receptor (BCR) stimulation (Goodnow et al., 1995; Shlomchik, 2008) ."
Effect of isolation practice on the transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus among hemodialysis patients A 2-year prospective cohort study,"Hemodialysis (HD) patients had a high rate of infection transmission and mortality during the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Saudi Arabia. A standardized guideline on isolation technique for exposed HD patients is not available. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different isolation strategies on the prevention of secondary viral transmission and clinical outcomes among exposed HD patients.","In 2012, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, which is a fatal disease, has caused panic worldwide because it spread within a short period of time in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, most fatality cases included patients in the intensive care unit and hemodialysis (HD) unit. [1] In 2015, the MERS-CoV outbreak also occurred in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases and 36 deaths. [2] During the outbreak, some dialysis patients in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to other patients or healthcare workers with confirmed MERS-CoV infection."
Risk factors for detection failures of chest radiography in diagnosing pneumonia,Little is known about clinical factors associated with undetectable pneumonic shadows on chest radiographs (CRs) for diagnosing pneumonia in the primary care setting.,"Radiographic examination has an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of pneumonia. According to Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society Consensus Guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia, a demonstrable infiltrate by chest radiograph (CR) or other imaging technique is required for the diagnosis of pneumonia in addition to a constellation of suggestive clinical features. 1 Although computed tomography (CT) is much more sensitive than chest radiography and can detect pneumonic shadows, which are difficult to identify on CRs, the greater cost and higher radiation exposure limit its use as a screening modality. There is little evidence to support the role of CT in diagnosing pneumonia."
Viral adaptation to host: a proteome-based analysis of codon usage and amino acid preferences,"Viruses differ markedly in their specificity toward host organisms. Here, we test the level of general sequence adaptation that viruses display toward their hosts. We compiled a representative data set of viruses that infect hosts ranging from bacteria to humans. We consider their respective amino acid and codon usages and compare them among the viruses and their hosts. We show that bacteriainfecting viruses are strongly adapted to their specific hosts, but that they differ from other unrelated bacterial hosts. Viruses that infect humans, but not those that infect other mammals or aves, show a strong resemblance to most mammalian and avian hosts, in terms of both amino acid and codon preferences. In groups of viruses that infect humans or other mammals, the highest observed level of adaptation of viral proteins to host codon usages is for those proteins that appear abundantly in the virion. In contrast, proteins that are known to participate in host-specific recognition do not necessarily adapt to their respective hosts. The implication for the potential of viral infectivity is discussed.","Viruses show appreciable variation in the selectivity with which they infect host organisms. Some viruses infect a broad range of species, whereas others infect only a single host. A successful viral infection requires that the virus possess the capability to enter the host cell and take over cellular functions and direct them toward the efficient production of new viruses. Most viruses recognize their respective hosts through membrane receptors that have a role in host physiology. Examples of such receptors are gangliosides, heparan sulfate moieties, and integrins (Garrigues et al, 2008) , which act as the cell receptors for simian virus 40 (SV40), human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), respectively. In stark contrast, for some viruses, host range is not limited to the recognition stage (McFadden, 2005) . For example, poxviruses bind to and enter a wide range of mammalian cells, but a fruitful replication cycle occurs only in a restricted set of hosts. Replication of poxviruses involves the host cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription factors, phosphatases, and interferon-induced mediators. Therefore, the features that govern the host range for poxvirus seem to involve a rich collection of host genes (McFadden, 2005) ."
In Situ Tolerance within the Central Nervous System As a Mechanism for Preventing Autoimmunity,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be an autoimmune disease in which autoreactive T cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS). Animal models of MS have shown that CNS-specific T cells are present in the peripheral T cell repertoire of healthy mice and cause autoimmune disease only when they are activated by immunization. T cell entry into the CNS is thought to require some form of peripheral activation because the blood-brain barrier prohibits trafficking of this tissue by naive cells. We report here that naive T cells can traffic to the CNS without prior activation. Comparable numbers of T cells are found in the CNS of both healthy recombinase activating gene (Rag) Ϫ / Ϫ T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice even when the transgenic TCR is specific for a CNS antigen. Transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for non-CNS antigens are phenotypically naive and proliferate robustly to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Strikingly, transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) are also primarily phenotypically naive but are unresponsive to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Mononuclear cells from the CNS of MBP TCR transgenic but not nontransgenic mice can suppress the response of peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. These results indicate that naive MBP-specific T cells can traffic to the CNS but do not trigger autoimmunity because they undergo tolerance induction in situ.","Activation of self-reactive T cells is one of the first steps in the development of autoimmune disease. The pool of autoreactive T cells available for activation is limited to a large extent by mechanisms of tolerance induction that eliminate self-reactive T cells (1) . Animal models of autoimmune disease, however, demonstrate that some self-reactive T cells remain in the periphery. These T cells are described as ""ignorant"" because they do not cause autoimmune disease when encountering self-antigen in vivo unless the self-antigen is presented in an immunostimulatory context (2, 3) . Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), 1 an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), illustrates this phenomenon. EAE is induced by immunization with central nervous system (CNS) antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) in CFA (4) . Recognition of MBP in this context activates naive T cells circulating in the periphery, which then enter the CNS and initiate destruction of myelin (5) . In the absence of experimental intervention, the MBP-specific T cells are not activated and do not induce EAE."

The analysis includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. For each patient, potential risk factors were collected. The main outcome of this study was the mortality during the stay in ICU after receiving mechanical ventilation Results: A total of 262 adults and 175 pediatric patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation during the study period. For adult patients, the overall mortality was 37%, with a median survival time of 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-20 days). The main risk factors independently associated with the increased mortality rate were being aged 51-60 (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-1.0) and factors related to ICU admission. For the pediatric population, the mortality rate was 17%, with a median survival time of 16 days (IQR 7-37 days)","M echanical ventilation is considered an important aspect of the supportive management of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Many studies have reported an increased rate of using mechanical ventilation over the last 7 years. This increase is attributable to increases in demand for acute and critical care delivery in many health care systems. This demand is being caused by an increasingly aging population, an increase in the survival of patients with comorbidity and cancer, an increase in the number of ICU beds, and the advancements in therapy management. [1] [2] [3] Thus, many observational studies have examined the use of mechanical ventilation and its associated outcomes, some of which have focused on estimating the mortality rate and identifying the factors related to the survival of patients who received mechanical ventilation. [4] [5] [6] [7] Data on the survival of patients admitted to ICUs and requiring mechanical ventilation, therefore, are varied. The variability in survival data reflects differences in ICU patients' selection criteria, patient care standards, and the characteristics of the population. In 2002, Esteban et al 8 evaluated the outcomes of adult patients admitted to ICUs and showed that the overall mortality rate was 52% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Another study by the same research group showed that crude mortality rate in ICUs had been decreased in 2010 compared to that in 1998 (31% versus 28%). 9 This improvement was related to the improvement in clinical practices over the period. Additionally, studies have reported that many factors related to the initiation of mechanical ventilation as well as other factors related to the management plan and complication during the course of mechanical ventilation affect the survival of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. 8, 10 In Saudi Arabia, many studies have examined the mortality outcome of patients admitted to ICUs; however, some of those studies have evaluated the outcome of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for specific indications, such as with severe respiratory conditions, 11, 12 or have focused on a specific population such as that with a hematological malignancy. [11] [12] [13] [14] However, the survival of patients admitted to an ICU and received mechanical ventilation with various indications and among heterogenous population has not been reported in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study; therefore, was to estimate the survival of adult and pediatric patients admitted to ICU and received mechanical ventilation, and to determine the associated factors influencing the survival. The results of this study will help in identifying patients at risk and planning appropriate preventive measures."
ACE/ACE2 Ratio and MMP-9 Activity as Potential Biomarkers in Tuberculous Pleural Effusions,"Objective: Pleural effusion is common problem, but the rapid and reliable diagnosis for specific pathogenic effusions are lacking. This study aimed to identify the diagnosis based on clinical variables to differentiate pleural tuberculous exudates from other pleural effusions. We also investigated the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of pleural exudates. Experimental design: The major components in RAS and extracellular matrix metabolism, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, were measured and compared in the patients with transudative (n = 45) and exudative (n = 80) effusions. The exudative effusions were come from the patients with tuberculosis (n = 20), pneumonia (n = 32), and adenocarcinoma (n = 28). Results: Increased ACE and equivalent ACE2 activities, resulting in a significantly increased ACE/ACE2 ratio in exudates, were detected compared to these values in transudates. MMP-9 activity in exudates was significantly higher than that in transudates. The significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 activity that was found in transudates was not found in exudates. Advanced analyses showed significantly increased ACE and MMP-9 activities, and decreased ACE2 activity in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with those in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. The results indicate that increased ACE and MMP-9 activities found in the exudates were mainly contributed from a higher level of both enzyme activities in the tuberculous pleural effusions. Conclusion: Interplay between ACE and ACE2, essential functions in the RAS, and abnormal regulation of MMP-9 probably play a pivotal role in the development of exudative effusions. Moreover, the ACE/ACE2 ratio combined with MMP-9 activity in pleural fluid may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy.","Pleural effusion is a common medical problem in the chest and involves accumulation of an abnormal amount of pleural fluid in the pleural space. Several diseases such as congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, adenocarcinoma, and pneumonia are common diseases that cause pleural effusions, but there is no rapid and accurate diagnostic method for pleural effusion. Conventional diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy is based on pleural fluid cytology, culture of pleural effusions, and pleural biopsy tissue culture, but these methods have very low sensitivity and recognised limitations in clinical use, and they usually require weeks for a positive culture report [1] . Therefore, a reliable clinical marker providing simple, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is required for patients with pleural effusion."
Site of Addition of N-Acetyl-galactosamine to the E1 Glycoprotein of Mouse Hepatitis Virus-A59,"By pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine and long-term labeling with 3H-sugars, the E1 glycoprotein of coronavirus MHV-A59 has been shown to acquire O-linked oligosaccharides in a two-step process. About 10 min after synthesis of the E1 protein, N-acetyl-galactosamine was added. This was followed ~10 min later by the addition of both galactose and sialic acid to give the mature oligosaccharides. This sequence of additions was confirmed by analyzing the 3H-labeled oligosaccharides bound to each of the El forms using gel filtration on P4 columns. The intracellular location of the first step was determined by ex-","ploiting the temperature sensitivity of virus release. The virus normally buds first into a smooth membrane compartment lying between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the cis side of the Golgi stack (Tooze et al., 1984) . At 31°C the virus is assembled but does not appear to enter the Golgi stacks. The addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine is unaffected although the addition of galactose and sialic acid is inhibited. These results strongly suggest that addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine occurs in this budding compartment, the morphology of which is similar to that of transitional elements and vesicles. p ROTEINS exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)' move through each of the cisternae of the Golgi stack before they are directed to their correct destination either inside or outside the cell (Rothman, 1981; Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . Many proteins undergo a series of posttranslational modifications during this transport including the addition of oligosaccharides which are either N-linked to asparagine or O-linked to serine or threonine. The sequence of modifications to these covalently bound oligosaccharides reflects the movement of the protein from one compartment to the next on the transport pathway. The addition and modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides has been extensively investigated (reviewed by Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1980) but much less is known about the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides. For the simplest and most common type there is indirect evidence that construction of the O-linked glycans is a two-step process, the addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc) preceding that of galactose (Gal) and sialic acid (NANA). The addition of the last two sugars almost certainly occurs in the trans part of the Golgi stack (Cummings et al., 1983; Elhammer and Kornfeld, 1984) . Proposals for the site of addition of the first sugar, however, range from the rough ER (Strous, 1979) , where the proteins are assembled, to the 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Gal, galactose; GalNAc, N-acetyl-galactosamine; MEM-met, methionine-free modified Eagle's medium; MHV-A59, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59; NANA, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (sialic acid); Tx-114, Triton X-tI4. cis part of the Golgi stack which is the entry point for proteins that have left the ER (Cummings et al., 1983; Roth, 1984) , to the medial part (Niemann et al., 1982; Elhammer and Kornfeld, 1984) , and finally to the trans-Golgi cisternae (Johnson and Spear, 1983) . Most of the evidence supports the idea that GalNAc is added either just before or just after the protein leaves the ER. There are several reasons why it has proven so difficult to locate the site of this first sugar addition, of which the absence of a combined biochemical and morphological study of the O-glycosylation of a single protein must rank as the most important."
SEASONALITY OF VIRAL RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN SOUTHEAST OF BRAZIL: THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND AIR HUMIDITY Viral respiratory infections,"Viruses are the major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in childhood and the main viruses involved are Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), Influenzavirus A and B (FLUA and FLUB), Human Parainfluenza Virus 1, 2 and 3 (HPIV1, 2 and 3) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV). The purposes of this study were to detect respiratory viruses in hospitalized children younger than six years and identify the influence of temperature and relative air humidity on the detected viruses. Samples of nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized children between May/2004 and September/2005. Methods of viral detection were RT-PCR, PCR and HRV amplicons were confirmed by hybridization. Results showed 54% (148/272) of viral positivity. HRSV was detected in 29% (79/272) of the samples; HRV in 23.1% (63/272); HPIV3 in 5.1% (14/272); HMPV in 3.3% (9/272); HPIV1 in 2.9% (8/272); FLUB in 1.4% (4/272), FLUA in 1.1% (3/272), and HPIV2 in 0.3% (1/272). The highest detection rates occurred mainly in the spring 2004 and in the autumn 2005. It was observed that viral respiratory infections tend to increase as the relative air humidity decreases, showing significant association with monthly averages of minimal temperature and minimal relative air humidity. In conclusion, viral respiratory infections vary according to temperature and relative air humidity and viral respiratory infections present major incidences it coldest and driest periods.

Data on relative air humidity were obtained from SOMAR Meteorology through daily measures of REDEMET (Air Command Meteorological Network) at Sao Jose do Rio Preto Airport.","Brazil is a country where several studies revealed viruses as the main causes of respiratory infections in Fortaleza, in Rio de Janeiro, in São Paulo and in Curitiba (18, 35, 36) , as reported by Arruda et al.

These viruses cause illness that can range from a brief upper respiratory tract infection, as a common cold, to a severe systemic illness, like bronchiolitis and pneumonia, resulting in death (11) ."
Complexity and Diversity of the Mammalian Sialome Revealed by Nidovirus Virolectins HHS Public Access,"Sialic acids (Sias), 9-carbon-backbone sugars, are among the most complex and versatile molecules of life. As terminal residues of glycans on proteins and lipids, Sias are key elements of glycotopes of both cellular and microbial lectins and thus act as important molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Their functions in such interactions can be regulated by postsynthetic modifications, the most common of which is differential Sia-O-acetylation (O-Ac-Sias). The biology of O-Ac-Sias remains mostly unexplored, largely because of limitations associated","addition and removal through sialate-O-acetylesterases (SOAEs) and sialate-O-transferases (SOATs) may thus act as a molecular switch to control downstream processes and events. This principle is illustrated by the regulation of peripheral B cell tolerance. Repression of antigen receptor signaling through Sia-dependent binding of Siglec 2/CD22 to the B cell receptor is modulated by Sia-9-O-acetylation/de-O-acetylation (Cariappa et al., 2009) , and defects in SOAE expression may be associated with autoimmunity (Pillai, 2013; Surolia et al., 2010) . Defective (de-)O-acetylation of Sias has also been implicated in cancer to correlate with metastatic potential, escape from apoptosis and drug resistance (Büll et al., 2014; Ghosh et al., 2007; Mukherjee et al., 2008; Parameswaran et al., 2013) ."
Incorporating uracil and 5-halouracils into short peptide nucleic acids for enhanced recognition of A-U pairs in dsRNAs,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures form triplexes and RNA-protein complexes through binding to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) regions and proteins, respectively, for diverse biological functions. Hence, targeting dsRNAs through majorgroove triplex formation is a promising strategy for the development of chemical probes and potential therapeutics. Short (e.g., 6-10 mer) chemicallymodified Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) have been developed that bind to dsRNAs sequence specifically at physiological conditions. For example, a PNA incorporating a modified base thio-pseudoisocytosine (L) has an enhanced recognition of a G-C pair in an RNA duplex through major-groove L·G-C base triple formation at physiological pH, with reduced pH dependence as observed for C + ·G-C base triple formation. Currently, an unmodified T base is often incorporated into PNAs to recognize a Watson-Crick A-U pair through major-groove T·A-U base triple formation. A substitution of the 5-methyl group in T by hydrogen and halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, and I) causes a decrease of the pK a of N3 nitrogen atom, which may result in improved hydrogen bonding in addition to enhanced base stacking interactions. Here, we synthesized a series of PNAs incorporating uracil and halouracils, followed by binding studies by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, and thermal melting. Our results suggest that replacing T with uracil and halouracils may enhance the recognition of an A-U pair by PNA·RNA 2 triplex formation in a sequence-dependent manner, underscoring the importance of local stacking interactions. Incorporating bromouracils and chlorouracils into a PNA results in a significantly reduced pH dependence of triplex formation even for PNAs containing C bases, likely due to an upshift of the apparent pK a of N3 atoms of C bases. Thus, halogenation and other chemical modifications may be utilized to enhance hydrogen bonding of the adjacent base triples and thus triplex formation. Furthermore, our experimental and computational modelling data suggest that PNA·RNA 2 triplexes may be stabilized by incorporating a Br UL step but not an L Br U step, in dsRNAbinding PNAs.","RNAs often form complex secondary and tertiary structures, and in turn, interact with proteins and metabolites for diverse regulatory and catalytic functions (1) (2) (3) . Doublestranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are essential components of RNA secondary structures (4) (5) (6) (7) . RNA triplex structures, formed between dsRNA regions and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) regions, are emerging as an important tertiary structure motif (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . It is thus of great potential to develop ligands that can selectively and sequence-specifically recognize viral and cellular dsRNA regions as chemical probes and therapeutics."
Bronchiolitis needs a revisit: Distinguishing between virus entities and their treatments,"Current data indicate that the ""bronchiolitis"" diagnosis comprises more than one condition. Clinically, pathophysiologically, and even genetically three main clusters of patients can be identified among children suffering from severe bronchiolitis (or first wheezing episode): (a) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis, characterized by young age of the patient, mechanical obstruction of the airways due to","Bronchiolitis is most often described as a virus-induced inflammation of small bronchioles and their surrounding tissue. According to different guidelines, its upper age limit varies from 6 or 12 months, 12 months being preferred by many European countries, to 2 years, used in the United States 1-3 Clinically, bronchiolitis is characterized by expiratory breathing difficulty in infants."
Frequent Asymptomatic Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections During an Epidemic in a Rural Kenyan Household Cohort,"Background. The characteristics, determinants, and potential contribution to transmission of asymptomatic cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have not been well described.","Determination of the incidence of infection is key in studying respiratory disease epidemiology and transmission patterns and, hence, in designing appropriate interventions. However, most studies rely on the clinical presentation of the illness to initiate diagnostic procedures [1] . Unrecognized asymptomatic infections are likely to form important links in transmission of respiratory viruses in the community. Few community studies have attempted diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection irrespective of symptoms [2] [3] [4] . Consequently, estimates of the proportion of RSV infections that are without symptoms are limited, and their contribution to transmission patterns at the community level has not been characterized. This may be especially important in older children and adults, in whom virus shedding (both amount and duration) is less than for younger individuals [5, 6] . These issues find focus in this article."
A Specific Transmembrane Domain of a Coronavirus E1 Glycoprotein Is Required for Its Retention in the Golgi Region,"The E1 glycoprotein of the avian coronavims infectious bronchitis virus contains a short, glycosylated amino-terminal domain, three membranespanning domains, and a long carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. We show that E1 expressed from cDNA is targeted to the Golgi region, as it is in infected cells. E1 proteins with precise deletions of the first and second or the second and third membranespanning domains were glycosylated, thus suggesting that either the first or third transmembrane domain can function as an internal signal sequence. The mutant protein with only the first transmembrane domain accumulated intracellulady like the wild-type protein, but the mutant protein with only the third transmembrane domain was transported to the cell surface. This result suggests that information specifying accumulation in the Golgi region resides in the first transmembrane domain, and provides the first example of an intracellular membrane protein that is transported to the plasma membrane after deletion of a specific domain.","T hE intracellular transport and targeting of proteins from their site of synthesis to their correct destination is a process instrumental to malntainence of cellular integrity. Membrane-bound and secreted proteins are sorted from cytoplasmic proteins and those destined for the nucleus or mitochrondria by virtue of a signal or leader sequence which directs insertion into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Walter et al., 1984) . Plasma membrane and secreted proteins follow a similar pathway through the cell, from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex en route to the plasma membrane (Sabatini et al., 1982) . Other proteins in this exocytic pathway are retained at points along the way, such as cytochrome P-450 in the endoplasmic reticulum (Brands et al., 1985) and galactosyl transferase in the Golgl complex (Roth and Berger, 1982) . Lysosomal enzymes are sorted to lysosomes after passage through the Golgi complex. Some lysosomal enzymes are sorted via a specific marker, a mannose-6-phosphate modification of asparagine-linked (N-linked) 1 oligosaccharides of these enzymes, which is recognized by a receptor (Sly and Fischer, 1982) ."
Human metapneumovirus in Pediatric Patients with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in the Aseer Region of Saudi Arabia,"Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a Paramyxovirus known to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children and young adults. To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. Results: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%).","Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus, recently classified in the order Mononegavirales, family Pneumoviridae, genus Metapneumovirus and species hMPV. It was first isolated in the Netherlands by van den Hoogen et al., [1, 2] and is now a known causative agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults. hMPV infections have been reported in Australia, [3] Canada, [4] the United States, [5] the United Kingdom, [6] Hong Kong, [7] South Africa, [8] Mexico, [9] Spain [10] and Peru. [11] However, in the Middle East, there have only been few reports of hMPV infections, mainly as sporadic infections in Egypt, [12] Jordan, [13] Kuwait [14] and Saudi Arabia. [15] Along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, hMPV is now recognized as a primary etiologic agent for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in pediatrics. [16, 17] In a study from Mexico, it was found that the number of hMPV infections increased in children aged 24-36 months as compared with those in younger age groups, whereas RSV infections were inversely proportional to increase in age. [9] Co-infection with both viruses can also occur, resulting in a more complicated and serious clinical disease. [3, 18] In addition to the pediatric population, studies have also found hMPV to infect adults [19] and elderly people. [20] In terms of transmission, hMPV spreads through contact with contaminated secretions, i.e., droplet, aerosol or fomites. Hospital-acquired hMPV infections have also been reported. [5] In young children, infections are usually not asymptomatic, and bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonia, is the most common associated presentation. [18, 20, 21] Other reported conditions include bronchial asthma exacerbation, otitis media, pneumonitis, flu-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. [9] In adults, hMPV has been associated with bronchitis, pneumonia and exacerbations of both bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [22, 23] In terms of detection, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive and commonly used method to detect hMPV. [5] Real-time RT-PCR is also commonly used for detecting hMPV in clinical specimens with many genomic target sequences. [24, 25] A touch-down genomic amplification protocol for the diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections has also been used previously. [26] The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hMPV diagnosis is a simple and specific serological test for anti-hMPV antibodies detection. [27] Immunofluorescence using specific antibodies is routinely used for detecting hMPV antigens, particularly in epidemiological studies. [28] However, cell culturing techniques have a low sensitivity in detecting hMPV from respiratory tract secretions, as the virus exhibits extremely limited types of cell tropism. [2, 10, 29, 30] In Saudi Arabia, there is a paucity of data regarding the occurrence of hMPV and its role in complicated clinical cases of commonly reported respiratory infections. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the role of hMPV in the respiratory tract infections' severity and complications among hospitalized children in the Aseer region, where no such study has previously been conducted."
Chest Radiographic and CT Findings of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Analysis of Nine Patients Treated in Korea,"Objective: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in Korea. Materials and Methods: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.","https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0132 kjronline.org COVID-19 patient was identified in South Korea (hereafter, Korea) on January 20, 2020. As of February 16, there were 29 COVID-19 patients in Korea, placing Korea in fifth place internationally in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients, after China, Singapore (72 patients), Japan (53 patients), and Thailand (34 patients). Deaths have almost exclusively occurred in China (1666 patients; 3.3%), rather than outside China (3 patients; 0.4%). The discrepancy in the death rate between China and other countries might be due to differences in the disease manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia or in other countries' capacity to manage a limited number of cases, in contrast to the overwhelming numbers of cases in China."

Packaging of Rift Valley fever virus pseudoviruses and establishment of a neutralization assay method,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute, febrile zoonotic disease that is caused by the RVF virus (RVFV). RVF is mainly prevalent on the Arabian Peninsula, the African continent, and several islands in the Indian Ocean near southeast Africa. RVFV has been classified by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as a category A pathogen. To avoid biological safety concerns associated with use of the pathogen in RVFV neutralization assays, the present study investigated and established an RVFV pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. This study used the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lentiviral packaging system and RVFV structural proteins to successfully construct RVFV pseudoviruses. Electron microscopy observation and western blotting indicated that the size, structure, and shape of the packaged pseudoviruses were notably similar to those of HIV lentiviral vectors. Infection inhibition assay results showed that an antibody against RVFV inhibited the infective ability of the RVFV pseudoviruses, and an antibody neutralization assay for RVFV detection was then established. This study has successfully established a neutralization assay based on RVFV pseudoviruses and demonstrated that this method can be used to effectively evaluate antibody neutralization.","Certain viruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and H5N1 subtype avian influenza virus, are highly infectious and highly pathogenic, presenting tremendous difficulties and dangers during research [8, 13, 19] . In contrast, pseudovirus technology is a very safe and effective research tool [18] . Briefly, a pseudovirus is a type of retrovirus that can integrate with the envelope glycoprotein of another type of virus to form a new virus with an exogenous viral envelope and a genome that maintains the characteristics of the retroviral genome. Compared with natural viruses, pseudoviruses integrate with the envelope protein of another virus by using an envelope protein-encoding gene within a modified nucleic acid molecule; pseudoviruses can only accomplish one infection cycle because they lose their self-replicating ability. Thus, pseudoviruses are more biologically safe than infectious viruses. Pseudoviruses also have extensive host ranges and higher transfection efficiencies, can be more easily concentrated than the original viruses, can defend against the deactivation function of serum complement, have a non-cell-cycle-dependent integration feature, and can efficiently transfect quiescent cells. Pseudovirus preparation is thus an effective, safe, and reliable method for application in the study of viruses with high pathogenicity that are difficult to culture in vitro. Because pseudoviruses are relatively safe and have the advantages of extensive host range, non-cell-cycle-dependence, and highly efficient transfection of quiescent cells, they can have particularly important roles in studies of virus-host cell interactions, neutralizing antibody titer evaluation, and gene therapy. Thus, pseudoviruses can be used as a novel, safe experimental tool."
EF-G catalyzed translocation dynamics in the presence of ribosomal frameshifting stimulatory signals,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is tightly regulated by messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences and structures in expressing two or more proteins with precise ratios from a single mRNA. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) between (Cy5)EF-G and (Cy3)tRNA Lys , we studied the translational elongation dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which contains three frameshifting signals: a slippery sequence (A AAA AAG), a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and a downstream hairpin. The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNA Lys and the slippery codons from the A-and P-sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options. These results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with EF-G dissociation upon unsuccessful translocation attempts of the second slippage codon from the A-to the P-sites.","Ribosomal frameshifting is programed in some messenger RNAs such that a ribosome can slip on a messenger RNA (mRNA) and start translating a new sequence of amino acids (1) (2) (3) (4) . Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is utilized in many RNA viral systems, including HIV-1, to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA (5, 6) . The Escherichia coli (E. coli) dnaX gene is a well-known -1PRF model system with high efficiencies in the range of ∼50 to ∼80% (7, 8) . Two DNA polymerase sub-units ( , ␥ ) are programed in the 0 and -1 reading frames (7) . Many biochemical studies showed that such efficient -1PRF is promoted by three mRNA signals in the dnaX gene; a hexanucleotide slippery sequence (A AAA AAG) coding two lysine codons, a stimulatory hairpin structure, and a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (8) (9) (10) . The distances between the signals are crucial for the frameshifting efficiency. For the most efficient frameshifting, the signals are positioned in a way that the slippery sequence is placed on the ribosomal peptidyl (P)-and aminoacyl (A)-sites while the downstream hairpin is at the ribosomal mRNA entrance channel. At the same time, the upstream SD sequence base pairs with 16S ribosomal RNA near the ribosomal exit (E) site."
Metformin Inhibits Proliferation of Human Thyroid Cancer TPC-1 Cells by Decreasing LRP2 to Suppress the JNK Pathway,"Objective: To uncover the potential effect of metformin on proliferation and apoptosis of thyroid cancer TPC-1 cell line, and the underlying mechanism. Methods: Viability, apoptosis and LRP2 level in TPC-1 cells treated with different doses of metformin for different time points were determined. Besides, protein levels of p-JNK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were detected by Western blot. Regulatory effects of LRP2 on the JNK pathway and cell viability in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were assessed. Results: Viability in TPC-1 cells gradually decreased with the treatment of increased doses of metformin either for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptotic rate was concentration-dependently elevated by metformin treatment. Relative levels of LRP2 and p-JNK1 were concentrationdependently downregulated by metformin treatment. In addition, overexpression of LRP2 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on the viability of TPC-1 cells. Conclusion: Metformin treatment suppresses the proliferative ability and induces apoptosis of TPC-1 cells by downregulating LRP2 to block the JNK pathway.","Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy in endocrine-related tumors. In recent years, thyroid cancer has been well concerned because of the rapid rise in its incidence. 1 As a first-line drug applied for T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus), metformin contributes to stabilize blood glucose levels through inhibiting gluconeogenesis and reducing hepatic glycogenolysis. 2 Interestingly, the application of metformin sharply decreases the incidences of tumor diseases, suppresses the growth of malignant cells and enhances chemotherapy-sensitivity. 3 Therefore, metformin may exert a potential anti-tumor role. It is expected to be an adjuvant drug for the treatment of thyroid cancer."
"Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam, 4 The Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme","Cross-species transmission of viruses poses a sustained threat to public health. Due to increased contact between humans and other animal species the possibility exists for cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. By using conventional PCR amplification and next generation sequencing, we obtained 130 partial or full genome kobuvirus sequences from humans in a sentinel cohort in Vietnam and various mammalian hosts including bats, rodents, pigs, cats, and civets. The evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders; we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders. Our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses, which are most closely related to human kobuviruses. The novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in Southern Vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses, but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents. We additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species, which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history.","Many human pathogens that are of current public health concern are zoonotic or originate from domestic or wild animals before adapting to humans (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Zhuo and Feschotte 2015) . Pathogens that infect multiple host species are more likely to emerge in human populations than host-restricted pathogens (Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse 2001) . It is therefore important to understand the genetic diversity of viruses circulating in both human and animal populations and to identify possible cross-species transmissions."
Correlation Between UpToDate Searches and Reported Cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome During Outbreaks in Saudi Arabia,Background. UpToDate is an online clinical decision support resource that is used extensively by clinicians around the world. Digital surveillance techniques have shown promise to aid with the detection and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks. We sought to determine whether UpToDate searches for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) could be used to detect and monitor MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia.,"Digital surveillance techniques have shown promise for aiding with the detection and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . UpToDate is an online clinical decision support resource that is used extensively by clinicians worldwide. Analysis of UpToDate search data showed a strong correlation with influenza activity in the United States [3] and was also useful for monitoring drug safety [7, 8] . The extent to which UpToDate search data could be useful for monitoring infectious disease outbreaks in different regions of the world is unknown."
Clinical Interventions in Aging Dovepress Cost-effectiveness analysis of oral versus intravenous drip infusion of levofloxacin in the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection in Chinese elderly patients,"Aim: Pharmacoeconomic cost-effectiveness analysis of two different dosage regimens of levofloxacin in the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 108 elderly patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection who visited by our hospital between September 2013 and September 2014 were randomly divided into Group A and Group B, with 54 patients in each group. In Group A, levofloxacin injection was given for continuous intravenous infusion treatment, whereas in Group B, levofloxacin injection and levofloxacin capsule were given as sequential therapy (ST). The period of treatment for both the groups was 10 days, and minimum cost analysis was used to analyze the treatment. Results: Groups A and B had cure rates of 61.1% and 59.3% (P0.05), effective rates of 88.9% and 83.3% (P0.05), bacterial clearance rates of 96.3% and 92.6% (P0.05), and incidence rates of adverse reactions of 7.4% and 3.7% (P0.05), respectively. Treatment costs of Groups A and B were 1,588 RMB and 1,150 RMB, respectively, whereas the cost-effectiveness of the two groups was at 17.86 and 13.81, respectively (P0.05). Conclusion: Levofloxacin ST had relatively higher cost-effectiveness ratio for the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients, especially Chinese.","Respiratory tract infection includes upper respiratory tract infection and lower respiratory tract infection. The former, one of the most common infectious diseases, was referred to acute inflammation from nasal cavity to the throat, and the latter, also a commonly seen infectious disease, could be cured only in the condition that an effective antibiotic is selected based on the identification of the pathogen that has caused the infection. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) continue to be an important cause of acute illnesses and mortality worldwide (especially in elderly people). 1, 2 The main reasons that cause acute lower respiratory tract infection in the elderly include 3 : 1) decreased immunity due to aging of the body, 2) weakened natural ventilation function and airway scavenging ability due to lower central cough reflex, 3) aspiration pneumonia, 4) mental factors, 5) changes in the climatic environment, and 6) bacterial infections."
Fall-related attendance and associated hospitalisation of children and adolescents in Hong Kong: a 12-year retrospective study,Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the trends and characteristics of fall-related attendance in accident and emergency department (AED) by injury type and the trend in associated average length of stay (LOS) among children and adolescents in Hong Kong.,"Falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injury in children and adolescents that impose significant burdens to the individuals and society. [1] [2] [3] [4] Previous studies have established an injury profile of Hong Kong, stating that over 40% of the child injuries were due to falls. 5 6 Fall-related injuries in childhood and adolescence may induce severe complications, such as traumatic brain injuries, 7 serious head injuries 8 and permanent disability, 9 that adversely affect the future development and productivity of the children and adolescents. These would impose considerable burden to the healthcare system. 10 The substantial impact of children and adolescent falls to the society can be reflected by the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Globally, falls have been reported as the 13th most common cause of DALYs lost, of which children and adolescents accounted for over 50% of the fall-related DALYs lost. 11 Given the high prevalence and substantial adverse effects of falls among children and adolescents, more efforts should focus on Strengths and limitations of this study ▪ To authors' knowledge, this is the very first study on paediatric fall patterns using fracture and non-fracture categorisation. ▪ This study captures the changes of the injury pattern of falls with respect to time and serves as an indicator for the establishment of fall prevention programmes in children and adolescents. ▪ This study captures all accident and emergency department (AED) attendances in all public hospitals due to fall injuries in Hong Kong, which covers >85% of the related AED attendances. ▪ The study may underestimate the incidence of fall injury in the population as only the AED figures were available. ▪ As the detailed mechanisms of fall remain unknown, further research such as case studies should be conducted in order to elucidate the mechanisms."
Evolution of Viral Proteins Originated De Novo by Overprinting,"New protein-coding genes can originate either through modification of existing genes or de novo. Recently, the importance of de novo origination has been recognized in eukaryotes, although eukaryotic genes originated de novo are relatively rare and difficult to identify. In contrast, viruses contain many de novo genes, namely those in which an existing gene has been ""overprinted"" by a new open reading frame, a process that generates a new protein-coding gene overlapping the ancestral gene. We analyzed the evolution of 12 experimentally validated viral genes that originated de novo and estimated their relative ages. We found that young de novo genes have a different codon usage from the rest of the genome. They evolve rapidly and are under positive or weak purifying selection. Thus, young de novo genes might have strain-specific functions, or no function, and would be difficult to detect using current genome annotation methods that rely on the sequence signature of purifying selection. In contrast to young de novo genes, older de novo genes have a codon usage that is similar to the rest of the genome. They evolve slowly and are under stronger purifying selection. Some of the oldest de novo genes evolve under stronger selection pressure than the ancestral gene they overlap, suggesting an evolutionary tug of war between the ancestral and the de novo gene.","Novel protein-coding genes can have two fundamental origins (reviewed in Long et al. 2003; Babushok et al. 2007; Bornberg-Bauer et al. 2010; Kaessmann 2010; Tautz and Domazet-Loso 2011) . In the first, a gene originates by modification of an existing gene, for example, through gene duplication, exon shuffling, gene fusion, horizontal gene transfer, or transposition. In the second, a gene originates de novo. This mechanism was thought to be highly improbable (Ohno 1970; Jacob 1977) , but recent studies have provided experimental evidence that it may be frequent. De novo origination can take place in a previously noncoding region, such as an intergenic region (Cai et al. 2008; Toll-Riera et al. 2009b; Li, Zhang, et al. 2010) , or an intron (Sorek 2007 ). However, a gene can also originate de novo from an open reading frame that already encodes a protein, by a mechanism called ""overprinting"", in which mutations lead to the expression of a second reading frame overlapping the first one (Ohno 1984; Keese and Gibbs 1992; Rancurel et al. 2009; Li, Dong, et al. 2010) . Genome-scale computational analyses or experimental analyses of RNA transcripts have proposed many candidate genes originated de novo through these mechanisms (Levine et al. 2006; Begun et al. 2007; Knowles and McLysaght 2009; Chen et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011; Yang and Huang 2011) ."
Early diagnosis of radiodermatitis using lactate dehydrogenase isozymes in hairless mice (SKH1-hr),"In this study, we evaluate a method for the early diagnosis of radiodermatitis for use in the prevention and therapy of this condition. Hairless mice (SKH1-hr) were used to study the early diagnosis of radiodermatitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) isozymes were analyzed using nativepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting of blood serum and tissues collected from SKH1hr mice. Radiodermatitis developed 24 days after the first X-irradiation. Reduced spleen weight was observed after the last X-irradiation (P<0.05). Thereafter the weight increased until 24 days after the first irradiation, finally reaching levels comparable to those in the sham-irradiated control group. LDH activity was the highest in skeletal muscle and lowest in blood serum. LDH C 4 , A 4 , A 3 B, A 2 B 2 , AB 3 , and B 4 isozymes were detected, in the mentioned order, from the cathode. This result was similar in other mouse strains. In the irradiated group, LDH A 4 isozyme levels were reduced in the serum until inflammation occurred, whereas those of B 4 isozyme were elevated. The subunits A and B followed a similar trend to that of LDH A 4 and B 4 isozyme, respectively. Importantly, antibodies against LDH B 4 isozyme could prove useful in the early diagnosis of radiodermatitis.","irradiation [8] ; however, early diagnosis of radiodermatitis has been difficult owing to the complexity of result interpretation. In addition, research on radiodermatitis diagnosis is insufficient because cancer therapy is highly important, and little can be done to alleviate the side effects."
A novel endonuclease IV post-PCR genotyping system,"Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV) based assay utilizing a substrate that mimics the abasic lesions that normally occur in doublestranded DNA. The three component substrate is characterized by single-stranded DNA target, an oligonucleotide probe, separated from a helper oligonucleotide by a one base gap. The oligonucleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5 0 end and fluorophore attached to the 3 0 end through a special rigid linker. Fluorescence of the oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when not hybridized. Upon hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe and helper probe to their complementary target, the phosphodiester linkage between the rigid linker and the 3 0 end of the probe is efficiently cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal. In this study, the use of the Endo IV assay as a post-PCR amplification detection system is demonstrated. High sensitivity and specificity are illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism detection.","Nucleic acid assays utilizing cleavage enzymes to generate a fluorescent signal from dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probes have been extensively used in diagnostics (1) (2) (3) . In these assays, the ability of fluorescent dyes to transfer energy absorbed from light to nearby molecules forms the basis of homogeneous nucleic acid based assays (1, 4, 5) . In the unhybridized state the fluorophore and quencher are within close proximity, which allows the quencher to absorb energy from the fluorophore to affect quenching. The use of fluorogenic probes in a 5 0 -nuclease polymerase assay, where the probe is enzymatically cleaved to release the fluorophore (2) , is well known. The signal amplification reaction utilizes invasive cleavage with structure-specific 5 0 -nucleases (6) . The method requires annealing of two oligonucleotides, called the upstream oligonucleotide and the probe, to a target sequence, which results in the formation of a unique substrate for the 5 0 -nuclease. In the DNAzyme-PCR strategy the primer contains a target-specific sequence and harbors the antisense sequence of a 10-23 DNAzyme. During amplification, amplicons are produced containing active sense copies of DNAzymes that cleave a reporter substrate included in the reaction mixture (7) . A target nucleic acid sequence can be amplified exponentially in vitro under isothermal conditions by using three enzymatic activities essential to retroviral replication: reverse transcriptase, RNase H (RNA cleavage) and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8) . Cycling probe technology represents a simple method for the detection of DNA target sequences, utilizing a chimeric DNA-RNA-DNA probe which is cleaved by RNase H when hybridized with its complementary target (9) ."
Mobile ECMO team for inter-hospital transportation of patients with ARDS: a retrospective case series,"Introduction: Transport of patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is currently available in 5 referral centers in our country. Methods: Retrospective case series of patients managed by our mobile extracorporeal membrane oxygenation team and transferred to San Gerardo University Hospital from December 2004 to December 2012. Results: 42 patients were transported. The mean age was 42.11 (standard deviation ±18.11) years, with a range between 2 years and 70. 14 patients were females (33%) and 28 males (67%). The average transport distance was 121.69 km (±183.08) with a range between 9 km and 1044 Km. The mission's mean time was equal to 508 minutes (±185) with range of 120-960 minutes. 29 patients (69%) were transported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, while 13 patients (31%) were transported with conventional ventilation. In 28 patients (97%) a veno-venous bypass was utilized, while in one case (3%) a Veno-Arterial cannulation was performed. 32 patients survived (76%) and have been discharged alive from hospital. No major clinical or technical issues were observed during the transport. Conclusions: According to our data, we conclude that a dedicated mobile team allowed safe ground transportation of patients with severe acute lung injury to our tertiary care institution.","The in-and out-of-hospital transport of the critically ill patient is a virtual risk of adverse clinical events also related to a potential equipment's failure (1) (2) (3) . Patient's safety is dependant on the adherence to transport's protocols (4, 5) . Patients af-fected by Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) present with hypoxia and instability of gases exchange, a situation which may require the use of extracorporeal respiratory support (ECMO -Extra Corporeal Membrane oxygenation) as an emergency life-saving therapy or as a protective strategy to prevent further barotraumas from mechanical ventilation (ALI -acute lung injury) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . In many cases, patients with ARDS should be referred to an ECMO centre, but the severe and often rapid onset of hypoxia, not manageable with conventional treatments, Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 may not allow for a safe conventional transport (11) (12) (13) (14) . The General Intensive Care of San Gerardo University Hospital-Monza has been working since 1989 as an Italian ECMO referring centre. Up to 2004, patients from different hospitals eligible for ECMO treatment were transported with conventional ventilation techniques by the same hospital's clinical team, increasing in this way risks related to unsafe transport. In 2004, inspired by similar programs carried out in other countries, we implemented and put in practice a new program of ECMO positioning at the reporting ICU and consequent inter-hospital transport of these patients (8, 11) . The basic team consist of two intensivists, an ICU nurse and a perfusionist. The aim of this paper is to present our 8-year experience on inter-hospital transport of patients with severe acute respiratory failure managed by our mobile transport team (which also has ECMO capability)."
Title: The impact of global healthcare experiences on provider practices in the United States: A qualitative study among global health physicians and program directors 2 3 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Objectives 40 This qualitative study attempts to understand the perspectives and experiences of United 41 States-based global health physicians and program leaders on how their experiences abroad 42 influence their healthcare practices in the United States. 43 44 Design 45 We administered online questionnaires and open-ended, semi-structured interviews with 46 global health physicians and program leaders affiliated with United States-based academic 47 medical centers.

Alternative splicing of CD200 is regulated by an exonic splicing enhancer and SF2/ASF,"CD200, a type I membrane glycoprotein, plays an important role in prevention of inflammatory disorders, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases and spontaneous fetal loss. It also regulates tumor immunity. A truncated CD200 (CD200 tr ) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full-length CD200. Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that SF2/ASF regulates the function of CD200 by controlling CD200 alternative splicing, through direct binding to an ESE located in exon 2 of CD200.","CD200 is a type 1 membrane glycoprotein, delivering immunoregulatory signals through binding to its receptors (CD200Rs) (1) (2) (3) (4) .

A Single-Center Study of Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalized Children From the Kurdistan Region of Iraq,"Viral respiratory infections are among the most common causes of disease in humans, particularly in young children, and remain a major public health problem worldwide. For many geographic regions, there is limited epidemiological information on the main causative agents of these diseases. In this article, we investigated, in a prospective study, the viral agents leading to acute respiratory disease in children younger than 15 years of age who were admitted to the pediatric emergency unit of a major teaching hospital in Erbil City, capital of the Kurdistan region, Iraq. Nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 269 hospitalized children were analyzed for viral respiratory pathogens using the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay, and the data were correlated with the clinical and demographic information available for these patients. One or more respiratory virus(es) were detected in 203 out of 269 (75.5%) samples. The most frequent viruses were enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 88; 32.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 55; 20.4%), and human metapneumovirus (n = 36; 13.4%). In 42 samples (15.6%), coinfections with 2 or more respiratory viruses were detected, with enterovirus/rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus being identified as the most common agents in viral coinfections in these patients.","Viral respiratory infections are among the most common causes of disease in humans, especially among children and infants, and a major public health problem due to the high prevalence, ease of transmission, and the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these infections. 1,2 Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) rank among the top 5 causes of illness and hospitalization in children, 3 with high childhood mortalities leading to about 5 million fatalities per year in developing countries in children younger than 5 years of age. 1, 4 Although ARIs can be caused by bacterial agents, they are predominantly caused by respiratory viruses. 2 Adenoviruses, coronaviruses, human enteroviruses (HEV), human rhinoviruses (HRV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are well-established causes of ARIs in both industrialized and developing countries."
Selection of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies in Porcine Whole Blood and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells under Polyinosinic:Polycytidylic Acid Stimulation,"Investigating gene expression of immune cells of whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) under polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation is valuable for understanding the immune response of organism to RNA viruses. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. However, the reliability of qRT-PCR data critically depends on proper selection of reference genes. In the study, using two different analysis programs, geNorm and NormFinder, we systematically evaluated the gene expression stability of six candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, RPL4, TBP, and PPIA) in samples of whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation. Generally, the six candidate genes performed a similar trend of expression stability in the samples of whole blood and PBMC, but more stably expressed in whole blood than in PBMC. geNorm ranked B2M and PPIA as the best combination for gene expression normalization, while according to NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene, followed by B2M and PPIA. Comprehensively considering the results from the two programs, we recommended using the geometric mean of the three genes, TBP, PPIA and B2M, to normalize the gene expression of whole blood and PBMC with poly I:C stimulation. Our study is the first detailed survey of the gene expression stability in whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation and should be helpful for investigating the molecular mechanism involved in porcine whole blood and PBMC in response to poly I:C stimulation. (","real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) can simultaneously measure gene expression in many different samples for a limited number of genes, and is especially suitable when only a small number of cells are available. It has become the standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. In case of qRT-PCR, the use of reference genes as internal controls is the most common method for normalizing mRNA data (Huggett et al., 2005) . The reference gene is a stably expressed gene that is experimentally verified in given species and tissues under given experimental conditions. However, an increasing number of reports have shown that the expression of some frequently used internal reference genes may vary significantly under different experimental conditions (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Nygard et al., 2007; Facci et al., 2011) . If the chosen reference gene has a large expression fluctuation among samples tested, the normalization will lead to erroneous gene expression profiles of the target gene of interest. Therefore, the selection of the most stable gene or set of genes as internal controls is a critical step to control the variability among samples for quantitative gene expression studies with a sensitive qRT-PCR technique."
Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) exhibits stage-and context-dependent transcriptional controls in the oligodendrocyte lineage and modulates remyelination,"Leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a zinc-finger transcription factor encoded by Zbtb7a, is a protooncogene that regulates differentiation in diverse cell lineages, and in the CNS, its function is relatively unexplored. This study is the first to examine the role of LRF in CNS pathology. We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen-induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6-week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone.","Differentiation within the oligodendrocyte lineage is regulated by complex mechanisms that work together to accomplish derepression of myelin genes (Liu & Casaccia 2010) . Many components involved in these processes have been identified but the molecular interactions are not yet fully understood. Moreover, mechanisms may be modulated in different contexts, such as developmental myelination, myelin remodeling in normal adults, or remyelination in adult pathology."
Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease,"Background: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.","Since December 2019, unexplained pneumonia has been successively identified in several patients with a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market, in multiple hospitals in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. These patients have now been confirmed as acute respiratory infection (i.e., pneumonia) caused by a novel coronavirus. [1, 2] Clinical investigation of confirmed cases and cases under observation has shown that the number of patients with no history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market has been rapidly increasing. As of February 1, 2020, there were 14,380 confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in China. [3] A previous study found that highest temperature, dyspnea, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, albumin, procalcitonin were risk factors for ICU care in patients with COVID-19. [4] Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to evaluate the possible factors affecting the progression of disease in COVID-19 patients. We investigated factors affecting the outcomes of COVID-19 patients to evaluate the prognosis and further improve the treatment of patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia with the hope of reducing mortality."
Viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cough aerosols generated by persons with cystic fibrosis,"Background Person-to-person transmission of respiratory pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a challenge facing many cystic fibrosis (CF) centres. Viable P aeruginosa are contained in aerosols produced during coughing, raising the possibility of airborne transmission. Methods Using purpose-built equipment, we measured viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols at 1, 2 and 4 m from the subject (distance) and after allowing aerosols to age for 5, 15 and 45 min in a slowly rotating drum to minimise gravitational settling and inertial impaction (duration). Aerosol particles were captured and sized employing an Anderson Impactor and cultured using conventional microbiology. Sputum was also cultured and lung function and respiratory muscle strength measured. Results Nineteen patients with CF, mean age 25.8 (SD 9.2) years, chronically infected with P aeruginosa, and 10 healthy controls, 26.5 (8.7) years, participated. Viable P aeruginosa were detected in cough aerosols from all patients with CF, but not from controls; travelling 4 m in 17/18 (94%) and persisting for 45 min in 14/18 (78%) of the CF group. Marked inter-subject heterogeneity of P aeruginosa aerosol colony counts was seen and correlated strongly (r=0.73-0.90) with sputum bacterial loads. Modelling decay of viable P aeruginosa in a clinic room suggested that at the recommended ventilation rate of two air changes per hour almost 50 min were required for 90% to be removed after an infected patient left the room. Conclusions Viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols travel further and last longer than recognised previously, providing additional evidence of airborne transmission between patients with CF.","Communicable respiratory infections are an important cause of mortality and morbidity and result in healthcare costs worth billions of dollars. 1 2 The person-to-person transmission of respiratory pathogens may occur by three key routes: contact transmission, where infectious respiratory secretions spread by direct contact or indirectly through a contaminated intermediate object or person; droplet transmission, where large infectious droplets travel directly over short distances from the respiratory tract to deposit onto mucosal surfaces (eg, nasal and conjunctival mucous membranes); and airborne transmission, involving dissemination of small droplet nuclei within the respirable size range that remain infectious over time and distance and are inhaled by susceptible individuals. 3 Airborne transmission may pose a significant risk for hospital-acquired respiratory infection, 4 with evidence that it is an important mode of acquisition for many respiratory infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Bordetella pertussis. 5 6 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lifelimiting autosomal-recessive disorder in Caucasians with most affected persons dying in their third-to-fourth decade from respiratory failure complicating chronic pulmonary infections. 7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen in CF lung disease, and once infection is established there is an accelerated decline in lung function, quality of life and survival. 8 9 While many patients with CF acquire P aeruginosa sporadically from the environment, molecular-typing studies show shared strains are common in some Open Access Scan to access more free content"
The prevalence of respiratory pathogens in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in an outpatient cohort,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness worldwide. In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood. We designed this study to identify respiratory pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pneumonia pathogens, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria.","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness that affects millions of people each year, and it is one of the most common infectious diseases that can lead to morbidity and mortality worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease Study reported that lower respiratory tract infection remains the second largest cause of death and years of life lost in 2013. 1 CAP is a disease that is diagnosed by clinical, epidemiological, radiographic and laboratory characteristics, and the clinician usually relies on empirical evidence when determining therapy, which can lead to antibiotic abuse. Therefore, the detection of respiratory pathogens is very important for the clinician to be able to treat CAP. Pathogens called bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause pneumonia. In adults, bacterial pneumonia has been extensively studied, but viral pneumonia is not as well understood. With the help of new diagnostic technologies, viral respiratory tract infections are being identified as common etiologies of CAP. In adults, approximately 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year, and 15-56% of CAP cases are associated with RVIs. 2, 3 We designed this study to identify pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pathogens, by multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."
Vaccines for emerging infectious diseases: Lessons from MERS coronavirus and Zika virus,"The past decade and a half has been characterized by numerous emerging infectious diseases. With each new threat, there has been a call for rapid vaccine development. Pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Zika virus represent either new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications. Both serve as paradigms for the global spread that can accompany new pathogens. In this paper, we review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and Zika virus with respect to vaccine development. The challenges in vaccine development and the approach to clinical trial design to test vaccine candidates for disease entities with a changing epidemiology are discussed.","The past decade and a half has been punctuated by multiple global infectious threats ( Table 1) . Epidemics of new influenza variants, novel coronaviruses and enteroviruses, new strains of Ebola virus, and the emergence of Zika virus and Chikungunya in regions of the world previously unaffected has created significant concerns in healthcare about minimizing the time from identification to disease control. Globalization of tourism and business have further complicated disease epidemiology that may have once been more localized but now poses greater potential for international spread."
PATRIC: The VBI PathoSystems Resource Integration Center,"The PathoSystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is one of eight Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases (NIAID) to create a data and analysis resource for selected NIAID priority pathogens, specifically proteobacteria of the genera Brucella, Rickettsia and Coxiella, and corona-, caliciand lyssaviruses and viruses associated with hepatitis A and E. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive bioinformatics resource for these pathogens, including consistently annotated genome, proteome and metabolic pathway data to facilitate research into counter-measures, including drugs, vaccines and diagnostics. The project's curation strategy has three prongs: 'breadth first' beginning with whole-genome and proteome curation using standardized protocols, a 'targeted' approach addressing the specific needs of researchers and an integrative strategy to leverage high-throughput experimental data (e.g. microarrays, proteomics) and literature. The PATRIC infrastructure consists of a relational database, analytical pipelines and a website which supports browsing, querying, data visualization and the ability to download raw and curated data in standard formats. At present, the site warehouses complete sequences for 17 bacterial and 332 viral genomes. The PATRIC website (https:// patric.vbi.vt.edu) will continually grow with the addition of data, analysis and functionality over the course of the project.","Bioterrorism became an important national security issue (1) following the deliberate release of anthrax spores into the US postal system in October 2001 (2) . Meanwhile, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (3) have had profound effects on public health in many parts of the world. Recognizing the pathogens responsible for these diseases as threats to homeland security, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the US National Institutes of Health has embarked upon a series of initiatives aimed at developing a comprehensive understanding of the organisms identified as NIAID category A, B and C priority pathogens (for a complete list, see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority. htm). The Virginia Bioinformatics Institute's PathoSystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is one of eight Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) established to study the NIAID priority pathogens and develop these information resources for the research community. While database resources for bacterial ((4) and those cited in (5) ) and viral (6, 7) genomics have been available for number of years, this project seeks to integrate genomics with comparative genomics and pathway analysis and ultimately proteomics, transcriptomics, immune epitope mapping, hostresponse and other downstream technologies. The goal is to help researchers and clinicians better detect and respond to biothreat agents (and infectious diseases in general) by facilitating the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. This requires access to comprehensive information on the molecular biology, physiology and pathogenicity of these organisms."
"A survey on infection control in emergency departments in Japan Committee for Infection Control for the Emergency Department, the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine, and the joint working group","Aim: Infection control in the emergency department is important for hospital risk management; however, few clinical guidelines have been established. This study aimed to determine whether hospitals in Japan have infection control manuals, and investigate the contents of manuals, consulting systems, and isolation facilities for emergency departments.","E MERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE the entrance to hospitals for all patients with diseases or injuries, including emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Some infectious diseases cause risks for secondary infection in health-care providers and other patients, 1 and most patients with infectious diseases are not diagnosed before admission. Patients with multidrug-resistant organisms admitted to the emergency department could cause a hospital outbreak. 2 Infection control in the emergency department is important for risk management in hospitals and regions. Various infectious disease outbreaks have recently occurred around the world, including severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, 3 pandemic influenza worldwide in 2009, 1 Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2014, 4 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Korea in 2015. 5 It was reported that 31 patients contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome from exposure in the emergency department at a university hospital in Taiwan. 3 A single patient admitted to an emergency department in Korea caused the Korean outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015. 5 These reports suggest that emergency departments can be key locations for the spread of emerging infectious diseases. However, in the abovementioned cases, the appropriateness of preparation, triage, and treatment in the emergency departments have not been reviewed. Few clinical guidelines for infection control in emergency departments have been established, 6 and not all institutions have their own manuals. In addition, current situations and issues related to infection control in emergency departments have not been examined or recognized. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM)-certified hospitals have infection control manuals for the emergency department, and to investigate manual contents, consulting systems, and isolation facilities. The results could contribute to establishing essential lists for preparing infection control manuals for emergency departments."
"Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.ae RNA Viruses: RNA Roles in Pathogenesis, Coreplication and Viral Load","The review intends to present and recapitulate the current knowledge on the roles and importance of regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, RNA binding proteins and enzymes processing RNAs or activated by RNAs, in cells infected by RNA viruses. The review focuses on how non-coding RNAs are involved in RNA virus replication, pathogenesis and host response, especially in retroviruses HIV, with examples of the mechanisms of action, transcriptional regulation, and promotion of increased stability of their targets or their degradation.","RNA agents have been shown to play essential roles in evolution and regulation in all D N A /protein based life: based on RNA stem-loop secondary structures (built of paired stems and not-paired loops), pseudoknots, and loops with sequences showing affinity to target proteins. Group I and group II introns, viroids, viral (R N A and DNA viruses, bacteriophages, retrotransposons, Long Terminal Repeats) networks cooperate within cellular genomes as modular. Some non-coding RNAs have built complementary consortia, such as rRNAs, tRNAs, spliceosomes, editosomes, and other ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) [1] . Additionally, counterbalancing modules such as restriction/modification (RM) modules have evolved, assuring identity (self/non-self) of organisms. All fine-tuned steps of key cellular processes such as gene expression, transcription, translation, D N A recombination and repair, epigenetic imprinting, as well as various forms of innate and adaptive immunity, are essentially constituted by natural genetic content operators."
B-cell restriction -an alternative piece to the puzzle,"Effective vaccination is based on three critical aspects of the B-cell response towards infectious agents: (i) that B-cells can generate specific antibodies towards a vast molecular diversity of antigens; proteins, sugars, DNA and lipids. There seems to be no limit to the ability to raise antibodies to everything. (ii) once stimulated, B-cells can perfect their antibodies through affinity maturation to complement every nook and cranny of the epitope and (iii) that the pathogen remains genetically stable and does not change to any great extent. Thus, antibodies produced against the vaccine and subsequent boosts recognize the viral virulent field isolates in future encounters and effectively knock them out. However, some vaccine targets, such as flu virus and HIV, are extremely genetically dynamic. The rapid genetic drift of these viruses renders them moving targets which assist in their ability to evade immune surveillance. Here we postulate that in the case of hypervariable pathogens the B-cell response actually might be ""too good"". We propose that restricting B-cell activities may prove effective in counteracting the genetic diversity of variant viruses such as flu and HIV. We suggest two levels of ""B-cell restriction"": (i) to focus the B-cell response exclusively towards neutralizing epitopes by creating epitope-based immunogens; (ii) to restrict affinity maturation of B-cells to prevent the production of overly optimized exquisitely specific antibodies. Together, these ""B-cell restrictions"" provide a new modality for vaccine design.","Epitope based vaccines; fuzzy vaccine; broad cross neutralization; affinity maturation; subunit vaccine; flu vaccine; AIDS vaccine; humoral response; B-cell immunity Training the immune system with vaccines has proven as an enormously effective means to prevent disease and save lives. 1 Since Jenner, millions and millions of children worldwide are protected yearly against diseases that in many countries and societies are now almost forgotten threats of the past. The general principle of vaccination is rather simple and straightforward; train our immune systems with dummy pathogens to gain experience and protection in the event that we encounter virulent forms in the future. Yet, while some vaccines work, others do not."
The Impact of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak on Trends in Emergency Department Utilization Patterns,"Changes occurred in the patterns of utilization of emergency medical services during the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak. The purpose of this study was to analyze the patterns of adult and pediatric patients who visited the emergency department (ED) during the outbreak. This retrospective study was conducted by analyzing changes in the patterns of visits among adult and pediatric patients in the ED at one tertiary teaching hospital in Korea. The study was performed from June 1, 2013 to July 31, 2015. The MERS outbreak period was from June 1 to July 31, 2015, and we compared that period to the same periods in 2013 and 2014. We compared and analyzed the patients' characteristics, emergency severity index (ESI) level at the visit, cause of visit, diagnosis, final dispositions, injury/non-injury, length of stay at the ED (EDLOS), and hospitalization rate. A total of 9,107 patients visited the ED during this period. Of these patients, 2,572 (28.2%) were pediatric patients and 6,535 (71.8%) were adult patients. The most common cause of an ED visit was fever (adult patients: 21.6%, pediatric patients: 56.2%). The proportion of non-urgent visits involving an ESI level of 4 or 5 and the EDLOS decreased significantly in pediatric and adult patients in comparison to that during the past two years. This change was significant in pediatric patients. Among adult patients, the rate of injury decreased, whereas it increased among pediatric patients. During the MERS outbreak period, pediatric ED visits due to non-urgent cases decreased significantly and there were more pronounced differences in ED utilization patterns in pediatric patients than in adult patients.","An outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in May 2015 in Korea. MERS entered the country through a single infected traveler and was amplified by infections in hospitals and the movement of cases within and between hospitals (1). Ninety-seven percent (181/186) of all the cases were associated with healthcare facilities (2) . Given that emergency departments (EDs) were suggested as the primary locations through which the virus was spread, changes in their utilization pattern (i.e., a decrease in ED visits) were observed."
Success of Big Infectious Disease Reimbursement Policy in China,"Big infectious diseases do harm to the whole society, and it is highly crucial to control them on time. The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government's intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases.","Infectious diseases always threaten the life of human being and even destroy social stability. People feel terrible when infectious diseases appear and nearly when there is no way to avoid the damage. Therefore, infectious disease is an important social issue and government should take step to control it. It is crucial for government to suppress infectious diseases."
"The methyltransferase domain of the Sudan ebolavirus L protein specifically targets internal adenosines of RNA substrates, in addition to the cap structure","In mononegaviruses, cap-MTase activities have been involved in the 2'O methylation and N7 methylation of the RNA cap structure. These activities play a critical role in the viral life cycle as N7 methylation ensures efficient viral mRNA translation and 2'O methylation hampers the detection of viral RNA by the host innate immunity. The functional characterization of the MTase+CTD domain of Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) revealed cap-independent methyltransferase activities targeting internal adenosine residues. Besides this, the MTase+CTD also methylates, the N7 position of the cap guanosine and the 2'O position of the n1 guanosine provided that the RNA is sufficiently long. Altogether, these results suggest that the filovirus MTases evolved towards a dual activity with distinct substrate specificities. Whereas it has been well established that cap-dependent methylations promote protein translation and help to mimic host RNA, the characterization of an original capindependent methylation opens new research opportunities to elucidate the role of RNA internal methylations in the viral replication.","Infections by Ebola virus can cause severe to fatal haemorrhagic fevers. The outbreak in West Africa in 2015 was unprecedentedly devastating causing more than 11,000 deaths (1) . Despite huge efforts and investment in research for the development of countermeasures and for understanding the viral life cycle, Ebola is still a priority disease for the WHO, due to the risk of re-emergence and lack of efficient vaccines or antivirals. The genus Ebolavirus is comprised of five species: Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus, EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (Sudan virus, SUDV), Tai Forest ebolavirus (Tai Forest virus, TAFV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bundibugyo virus, BDBV) and Reston ebolavirus (Reston virus, RESTV) (2, 3) . They belong to the Filoviridae family together with other filamentous viruses such as Marburg marburgvirus (Marburg virus, MARV), which also causes acute haemorrhagic fevers. Having a non-segmented negative strand RNA genome (NNS), the Filoviridae are part of the Mononegavirales order, which also contains the well-characterized non-pathogenic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as important human pathogens such as measles, Hendra and rabies viruses (4) ."

In this study we have defined a novel post-RER, pre-Golgi compartment where unassembled subunits of rubella virus (RV) E1 glycoprotein accumulate. When RV E1 is expressed in CHO cells in the absence of E2 glycoprotein, transport of E1 to the Golgi complex is arrested. The compartment in which E1 accumulates consists of a tubular network of smooth membranes which is in continuity with the RER but has distinctive properties from either the RER, Golgi, or previously characterized intermediate compartments. It lacks RER and Golgi membrane proteins and is not disrupted by agents which disrupt either the RER (thap-sigargin, ionomycin) or Golgi (nocodazole and brefeldin A). However, luminal ER proteins bearing the KDEL signal have access to this compartment. Kinetically the site of E1 arrest lies distal to or at the site where palmitylation occurs and proximal to the low temperature 15~ block. Taken together the findings suggest that the site of E1 arrest corresponds to, or is located close to the exit site from the ER. This compartment could be identified morphologically because it is highly amplified in cells overexpressing unassembled E1 subunits, but it may have its counterpart among the transitional elements of non-transfected cells.

Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID): a dynamic birth cohort study,"Introduction: Even in developed economies infectious diseases remain the most common cause of illness in early childhood. Our current understanding of the epidemiology of these infections is limited by reliance on data from decades ago performed using low-sensitivity laboratory methods, and recent studies reporting severe, hospital-managed disease.","Even in developed economies where populations have high-quality housing, sanitation, secure food and drinking water supplies, good personal hygiene standards, widespread vaccine use and access to high-quality medical care, infectious diseases remain the most ARTICLE SUMMARY Article focus ▪ Infectious diseases are a common cause of morbidity in early childhood, even in developed economies. ▪ A diagnostic gap exists for common respiratory and gastrointestinal syndromes, with the likelihood that as yet undiscovered pathogens are involved. ▪ Existing knowledge about these common illnesses relies on research conducted before the rapid developments in molecular diagnostics of recent decades or focuses on disease at the severe end of the spectrum-hospitalisationsaffecting a limited number of children and discounting the burden of more common, but less severe, community-managed illness."

,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious enteric swine disease. The large economic impact of PED on the swine industry worldwide has made the development of an effective PED vaccine a necessity. S0, a truncated region of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spike protein, has been suggested as a candidate antigen for PED subunit vaccines; however, poor solubility problems when the protein is expressed in Escherichia coli, and the inherent problems of subunit vaccines, such as low immunogenicity, remain. Flagellin has been widely used as a fusion partner to enhance the immunogenicity and solubility of many difficult-to-express proteins; however, the conjugation effect of flagellin varies depending on the target antigen or the position of the fusion placement. Here, we conjugated flagellin, Vibrio vulnificus FlaB, to the N-and C-termini of S0 and evaluated the ability of the fusion to enhance the solubility and immunogenicity of S0. Flagellin conjugation in the presence of the trigger factor chaperone tig greatly improved the solubility of the fusion protein (up to 99%) regardless of its conjugation position. Of importance, flagellin conjugated to the N-terminus of S0 significantly enhanced S0-specific humoral immune responses compared to other recombinant antigens in Balb/c mice. The mechanism of this phenomenon was investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies. These findings provide important information for the development of a novel PED vaccine and flagellinbased immunotherapeutics.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is one of the most catastrophic swine diseases and is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and even death [1] . The mortality rate of PED is up to 80-100%, especially in neonatal piglets [2, 3] , resulting in large economic losses for swine farms across the globe, including Europe, Asia and the USA for the past three decades [1, 4, 5] , and making the development of an effective PED vaccine a necessity."
Inhaled Nitric Oxide Therapy Fails to Improve Outcome in Experimental Severe Influenza,"In vitro, nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to have antimicrobial activity against a wide range of viruses, including influenza A virus. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) would increase survival in vivo by reducing the viral load in C57Bl/6 mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1; WSN/33) virus. NO was delivered to influenza-infected mice either continuously or intermittently at 80 or 160 ppm, respectively, using both prophylactic and post-infection treatment strategies. Murine survival and weight loss were assessed, and lung viral load was quantified via plaque assay. Here, we report that iNO administered prophylactically or post-influenza infection failed to improve survival of infected mice. No difference in lung viral load was observed between experimental groups. Although NO has antiviral activity against influenza A virus in vitro, iNO therapy provided no apparent benefit when used for treatment of influenza A virus infection in vivo.","Influenza A viruses infect approximately 5-15% of the population, resulting in 250-500 thousands deaths each year (1) . The most widely used class of drugs for treatment of clinical influenza is the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir and zanamivir. The clinical impact of these drugs is limited by the development of antiviral drug resistance. Specifically, decreased efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors has been reported against seasonal H1N1 influenza and 2009 novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza, as well as avian influenza H5N1 virus (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . In addition, initiation of antiviral therapy in influenza A virus-infected individuals beyond the first 48-72 hours after the onset of influenza symptoms is asso-ciated with greater mortality and decreased antiviral efficacy compared with treatment initiated within 48-72 hours of symptom onset (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . These caveats underscore the need to develop novel and effective influenza therapeutic strategies. Further investigation of other intervention strategies which have shown promising results against influenza A viruses in vitro but have not been investigated in vivo are warranted."
Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.net A Brief Review: The Z-curve Theory and its Application in Genome Analysis,"In theoretical physics, there exist two basic mathematical approaches, algebraic and geometrical methods, which, in most cases, are complementary. In the area of genome sequence analysis, however, algebraic approaches have been widely used, while geometrical approaches have been less explored for a long time. The Z-curve theory is a geometrical approach to genome analysis. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that represents a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. The Z-curve, therefore, contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. The analysis of a DNA sequence can then be performed through studying the corresponding Z-curve. The Z-curve method has found applications in a wide range of areas in the past two decades, including the identifications of protein-coding genes, replication origins, horizontally-transferred genomic islands, promoters, translational start sides and isochores, as well as studies on phylogenetics, genome visualization and comparative genomics. Here, we review the progress of Z-curve studies from aspects of both theory and applications in genome analysis.","In theoretical physics, there exist two basic mathematical approaches, algebraic and geometrical methods, which, in most cases, are complementary.

Num 1,"Since the mid-19 th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence.","I n the last decade, the interest in the effect of climate change on human health has increased. The impact of Homo sapiens and his activities on the Earth's complex ecosystem have started since the beginning of farming, but it is only with the industrial revolution in the 18 th century that the changes produced by human activities on planet Earth have been accelerating exponentially. Precisely, re v i e w because of the role played by Homo sapiens in changing the ecosystem in order to ensure his survival and his development, the actual geological era, which follows the Holocene, is called the Anthropocene. 1 The Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel n Climate Change), finalized in November 2014 confirms that human activities have produced since the mid-19 th century, an increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere and an increase in average temperature without comparison in human history. The Earth's temperature has been relatively constant over many centuries ago, meanwhile in the last two centuries the changes registered are unprecedented on time scales ranging from decades to millennia. The rate of change in climate is faster now than in any other period in the past thousand years."
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Recombination and the Evolution of Science and Public Health in China,Citation Lipkin WI. 2015. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus recombination and the evolution of science and public health in China. mBio 6(5):e01381-15.,"S ince the discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in late 2012, more than 1,400 people have received a laboratory diagnosis of MERS and over 450 people have died. Most of the cases have been documented on the Arabian Peninsula; however, sporadic cases have also been reported in Europe and Asia in travelers returning from the Middle East. Except in South Korea, the imported MERS-CoV has not established a substantive chain of infection beyond the index traveler case. The spread within South Korea to 186 people, resulting in 36 deaths, has been attributed to a delay in diagnosis and isolation of the index case, lapses in infection control, and care of patients by family members rather than trained medical staff. This interpretation was supported by a preliminary report from a World Health Organization panel wherein no mutations linked to transmissibility or pathogenesis were found in sequences obtained in South Korea and China. However, in a recent mBio article, Wang and colleagues report detailed genomic analysis of the virus implicated in the first known case of MERS in China (1). They describe 11 amino acid substitutions, 8 of them shared with the South Korean strain and MERS-CoV strains recently circulating in Saudi Arabia, and define a recombination event that they speculate may have contributed to enhanced human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV and the rapid spread of the virus in South Korea."
Reduction of influenza virus-induced lung inflammation and mortality in animals treated with a phosophodisestrase-4 inhibitor and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,"Inflammatory responses contribute to the morbidity and mortality of severe influenza. Current antiviral therapy offers limited success in treating severe influenza infection with both H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. We evaluated the effect of a neuraminidase inhibitor in combination with immunomodulatory drugs in vitro and in a mouse model of influenza A H1N1 infection by determining survival rate, lung inflammation markers and histopathology. Sertraline and rolipram significantly improved survival in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A H1N1 virus. Prophylactic treatment resulted in survival rates of 40% (rolipram), 30% (oseltamivir), 0% (sertraline), 100% (rolipram/oseltamivir) and 70% (sertraline/oseltamivir). Treatment in a therapeutic setting (24 h post-infection) resulted in 80% (rolipram/oseltamivir) and 40% (sertraline/oseltamivir) survival. Sertraline and rolipram had no effect on virus replication in vitro and in vivo, but significantly reduced lung inflammation. A significant reduction in cellular infiltration (10-fold) along with inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (10-fold), interleukin-6 (5-fold) and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (5-fold) was observed in the animals treated with the combination compared to oseltamivir alone. Lung histopathology of mice treated with combinations revealed significantly reduced consolidation, infiltration and alveolitis compared to oseltamivir alone. Rolipram and sertraline reduced H1N1 virus-induced lung inflammation and mortality. These data support further development of immunomodulatory agents for severe influenza.","Seasonal influenza A virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality and lead to an estimated 250 000-500 000 deaths worldwide, and over 35 000 deaths in the United States annually. 1 Major antigenic shift associated with genetic reassortment has led to devastating pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968 , when pathogenic viruses with efficient human-to-human transmission entered the human population with no pre-existing immunity. 2 H5N1 avian influenza virus and the recently emerged influenza A H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus of swine origin pose serious threats to human health. Recent data on mammalian transmission of H5N1 in experimental animals [3] [4] [5] underscore the continued pandemic threat posed by H5N1."
Epidemiological Determinants of Successful Vaccine Development,"Epidemiological determinants of successful vaccine development were explored using measurable biological variables including antigenic stability and requirement of T-cell immunity. Employing a logistic regression model, we demonstrate that a high affinity with blood and immune cells and pathogen interactions (e.g. interference) would be the risk factors of failure for vaccine development.","The estimated low effectiveness of malaria vaccine and dengue vaccine in the field [1, 2] have disappointed a certain fraction of vaccine enthusiasts. Both vaccines offered some hope in advance of the field studies, but clinical protection in infants and other groups appears to be lower than the earlier expectation based on laboratory experiments and smaller-scale clinical studies among older individuals. As part of lessons to be learnt from these unfavorable outcomes (and from success in earlier vaccines), there is a growing need to clarify what risk factors determine successful and unsuccessful vaccines [3] ."
Heparan Sulfate-Dependent Enhancement of Henipavirus Infection,"Nipah virus and Hendra virus are emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic paramyxoviruses that belong to the genus Henipavirus. They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species. Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host. We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host. Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection. Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay. Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections.","required for cell-mediated trans-infection. As proteoglycans are used by several viruses for binding to target cells (9, 10) , we investigated their potential role as a henipavirus attachment receptor."
Polysialic acid is a cellular receptor for human adenovirus 52,"Human adenovirus 52 (HAdV-52) is one of only three known HAdVs equipped with both a long and a short fiber protein. While the long fiber binds to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor, the function of the short fiber in the virus life cycle is poorly understood. Here, we show, by glycan microarray analysis and cellular studies, that the short fiber knob (SFK) of HAdV-52 recognizes long chains of α-2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia), a large posttranslational modification of selected carrier proteins, and that HAdV-52 can use polySia as a receptor on target cells. X-ray crystallography, NMR, molecular dynamics simulation, and structure-guided mutagenesis of the SFK reveal that the nonreducing, terminal sialic acid of polySia engages the protein with direct contacts, and that specificity for polySia is achieved through subtle, transient electrostatic interactions with additional sialic acid residues. In this study, we present a previously unrecognized role for polySia as a cellular receptor for a human viral pathogen. Our detailed analysis of the determinants of specificity for this interaction has general implications for proteincarbohydrate interactions, particularly concerning highly charged glycan structures, and provides interesting dimensions on the biology and evolution of members of Human mastadenovirus G.","Human adenovirus 52 (HAdV-52) is one of only three known HAdVs equipped with both a long and a short fiber protein.

"Effect of Antigen/Antibody Ratio on Macrophage Uptake, Processing, and Presentation to T Cells of Antigen Complexed with Polyclonal Antibodies","Activation of a galactosidase-specific murine T hybridoma clone and of a human tetanus toxoid-specific T clone by antigen-presenting cells (APC) was used to evaluate the regulatory function ofantibodies complexed with the relevant antigen . Complexed antigen, in fact, is taken up with high efficiency thanks to Fc receptors borne by APC . Antibody/antigen ratio in the complexes proved to be a critical parameter in enhancing antigen presentation . Complexes in moderate antibody excess provided optimal T cell activation independently of the physical state of the complexes {precipitated by a second antibody or solubilized by complement) . Complexes in extreme antibody excess, on the contrary, did not yield T cell activation although taken up by APC efficiently. The effect of antibodies at extreme excess was observed with substimulatory dose of antigen (loss of potentiation) and with optimal dose of antigen (loss of stimulation). An excess of specific polyclonal antibodies hampers proteolytic degradation of antigen in vitro, supporting the view that a similar mechanism may operate within the APC that have internalized immune complexes in extreme antibody excess. The possibility that immune complex forming in extreme antibody excess may turn off the T cell response is proposed as a regulatory mechanism .","I gs , the effector molecules of the immune response produced by B lymphocytes, have long been known to act also as positive or negative regulatory elements of the antibody response at different levels (1, 2) . More recently, it has been demonstrated that antibodies complexed with soluble antigens interfere with the T cell response . Inhibitory effect has been reported in the cytochrome system (3, 4) , but enhanced T cell response has been observed when antibodies bound with antigen promote Fc receptor-mediated recognition by APC (5, 6) . Complexed antibodies can also influence the fine specificity of the T cell response (7, 8) , possibly by modulating the processing pattern of antigen internalized by APC in complexed form (9, 10) and the subsequent spectrum ofpeptides that are made available for MHC binding and presentation to T cells. These mechanisms affect the selection of the T repertoire and offer a linkage between the previous experience of the immune system and the current response ."
T H E CELLULAR NATURE OF GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO A VIRUS*,PLATES 45 ~o 50,"Macrophage Cultures.--Each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with 2 to 3 ml of sterile thiogiycollate medium; the following day about 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing penicillin, streptomycin and heparin (200 units, 50/zg and 5 U.S.P. units/ml respectively) was injected intraperitoneally and after a gentle massage of the area the e.xudate was withdrawn. The number of cells in the exudate was determined by staining a small sample with 0.01 per cent crystal violet in 0.1 ~ dtric acid and counting in a Spencer chamber. The cells were then separated by centrifugatiou (1000 m,M for I0 minutes), washed with Hanks' BSS, and resuspended in Chang's (6) medium containing 90 per cent inactivated horse serum, 2 per cent beef embryo extract, and 8 per cent Hanks' BSS, to give a final concentration of 1 X l0 s cells per ml. One ml of macrophage suspension was inoculated into standard size Wassermann tubes (10 X 100 ram). The tubes were placed in a stationary position for 8 to I0 hours and then rotated in a roller drum. The macrophages were usually attached to the glass after a few hours and began to spread over the surfaces after t to 2 days. The medium was renewed about every 4 days."

ALIC 4 E is likely therefore to enhance the evidence base supporting and important and common area of clinical practice.","Introduction Effective management of seasonal and pandemic influenza is a high priority internationally. Guidelines in many countries recommend antiviral treatment for older people and individuals with comorbidity at increased risk of complications. However, antivirals are not often prescribed in primary care in Europe, partly because its clinical and cost effectiveness has been insufficiently demonstrated by non-industry funded and pragmatic studies. Methods and analysis Antivirals for influenza-Like Illness? An rCt of Clinical and Cost effectiveness in primary CarE is a European multinational, multicentre, open-labelled, nonindustry funded, pragmatic, adaptive-platform, randomised controlled trial. Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for 5 days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants ≥1 year presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration ≤72 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, headache and muscle ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating costeffectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (<12, 12-64 and >64 years), severity of symptoms at presentation (low, medium and high), comorbidity (yes/no), duration of symptoms (≤48 hours/>48-72 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia), use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, use of over-the-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics committee (REC) approval was granted by the NRES Committee South Central (Oxford B) and Clinical Trial Authority (CTA) approval by The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. All participating countries gained national REC and CTA approval as required. Dissemination of results will be through peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference presentations. trial registration number ISRCTN27908921; Preresults."
FULL PAPER Pathology Porcine alveolar macrophage polarization is involved in inhibition of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication,"Macrophage polarization is a process by which macrophages acquire a distinct phenotypic and functional profile in response to microenvironmental signals. The classically and alternatively activated (M1 and M2, respectively) macrophage phenotypes are defined by the specific molecular characteristics induced in response to prototypic pro-and anti-inflammatory cues. In this study, we used LPS/IFN-γ and IL-4 to stimulate porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro and investigated the expression changes of several novel markers during macrophage polarization. Notably, we found that LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated PAMs express prototypical M1 molecules, whereas IL-4-stimulated PAMs express M2 molecules. We also demonstrated that replication of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain HuN4 was effectively suppressed in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated M1 PAMs (M1 type), but not IL-4 stimulated M2 PAMs. However, this was not observed with the classic, less pathogenic CH-1a strain. Moreover, we found that M2 marker expression gradually increased after PAM infection with PRRSV, whereas no significant changes were found with M1 marker expression, suggesting that PRRSV infection may skew macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype. Finally, we found that anti-viral cytokine expression was significantly higher in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages or nonpolarized controls. In summary, our results show that PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs, which may serve as a foundation for further understanding of the dynamic phenotypic changes during macrophage polarization and their effects on viral infection.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes a complex systemic disease in pigs that primarily affects the respiratory and reproductive systems of infected hosts, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry worldwide [4, 20, 32] . PRRSV infection is characterized by spontaneous abortion and poor reproductive performance in pregnant sows, respiratory distress in young pigs and high mortality in piglets [22] . PRRSV has a very narrow cellular tropism, showing a preference for monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Specifically, the virus infects certain subsets of differentiated macrophages in the lung, lymphoid tissues and placenta and replicates in testicular germ cells and monocytic lineage cells, particularly porcine alveolar macrophages [5, 6, 24, 30] . Thus, the lungs and lymphoid organs are obvious locations of prolonged viral replication and persistence [16] ."
Transcription attenuation-derived small RNA rnTrpL regulates tryptophan biosynthesis gene expression in trans,"Ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation is a basic posttranscriptional regulation mechanism in bacteria. Liberated attenuator RNAs arising in this process are generally considered nonfunctional. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes are organized into three operons, trpE(G), ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA, and trpFBA-accD-folC, of which only the first one, trpE(G), contains a short ORF (trpL) in the 5 -UTR and is regulated by transcription attenuation. Under conditions of Trp sufficiency, transcription is terminated between trpL and trpE(G), and a small attenuator RNA, rnTrpL, is produced. Here, we show that rnTrpL base-pairs with trpD and destabilizes the polycistronic trpDC mRNA, indicating rnTrpL-mediated downregulation of the trpDC operon in trans. Although all three trp operons are regulated in response to Trp availability, only in the two operons trpE(G) and trpDC the Trp-mediated regulation is controlled by rnTrpL. Together, our data show that the trp attenuator coordinates trpE(G) and trpDC expression posttranscriptionally by two fundamentally different mechanisms: ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation in cis and base-pairing in trans. Also, we present evidence that rnTrpL-mediated regulation of trpDC genes expression in trans is conserved in Agrobacterium and Bradyrhizobium, suggesting that the small attenuator RNAs may have additional conserved functions in the control of bacterial gene expression.","Since the discovery of ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation in bacteria 40 years ago (1, 2) , it has been presumed that terminated attenuator RNAs have no own functions (3) . Here, we show that, in Sinorhizobium meliloti, an attenuator RNA that is liberated under conditions of tryptophan (Trp) sufficiency acts in trans to destabilize Trp biosynthesis (trp) mRNA."
"Kingdom of Saudi Arabia e ; Saudi Aramco Medical Services Organization, Saudi Aramco, Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia f ; Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia g","The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and, to date, has been identified in 180 cases with 43% mortality. In this study, we have determined the MERS-CoV evolutionary rate, documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the Arabian peninsula, and identified the genome positions under positive selection, important features for monitoring adaptation of MERS-CoV to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections. Respiratory samples from confirmed KSA MERS cases from May to September 2013 were subjected to whole-genome deep sequencing, and 32 complete or partial sequences (20 were >99% complete, 7 were 50 to 94% complete, and 5 were 27 to 50% complete) were obtained, bringing the total available MERS-CoV genomic sequences to 65. An evolutionary rate of 1.12 ؋ 10 ؊3 substitutions per site per year (95% credible interval [95% CI], 8.76 ؋ 10 ؊4 ; 1.37 ؋ 10 ؊3 ) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95% CI, December 2011; June 2012). Only one MERS-CoV codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection. Four KSA MERS-CoV phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases. The size of the population infected with MERS-CoV showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for the virus that is less than 1. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV adaptation toward higher rates of sustained human-to-human transmission appears not to have occurred yet. While MERS-CoV transmission currently appears weak, careful monitoring of changes in MERS-CoV genomes and of the MERS epidemic should be maintained. The observation of phylogenetically related MERS-CoV in geographically diverse locations must be taken into account in efforts to identify the animal source and transmission of the virus.","A detailed description of MERS-CoV evolution is useful to assess public health risks, to help identify the source of new infections, and to detect viral adaptation to human transmission. In this report, we advance our knowledge of the MERS-CoV outbreak with complete or partial MERS-CoV genome sequences obtained directly from 32 recent MERS patient samples from cases between July and September 2013, bringing the total available MERS-CoV genomic sequences to 65 (37% of the 178 MERS cases reported globally)."
"Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor Binds to Annexin II, a Cofactor for Macrophage HIV-1 Infection","The distribution of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) at entry portals indicates its involvement in defending the host from pathogens, consistent with the ability of SLPI to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by an unknown mechanism. We now demonstrate that SLPI binds to the membrane of human macrophages through the phospholipidbinding protein, annexin II. Based on the recent identification of human cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer coat of HIV-1, we define a novel role for annexin II, a PS-binding moiety, as a cellular cofactor supporting macrophage HIV-1 infection. Moreover, this HIV-1 PS interaction with annexin II can be disrupted by SLPI or other annexin II-specific inhibitors. The PS-annexin II connection may represent a new target to prevent HIV-1 infection.","Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), originally identified as a serine protease inhibitor at portals of pathogen entry and in mucosal fluids (1) , has more recently been associated with multiple functions relevant to innate host defense (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . One of the first novel non-antiprotease functions identified for SLPI was its ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection of macrophages, which appeared to be effected through interaction with unidentified host cell molecules and not the virus (2, 3) . In addition to CD4, macrophages express CCR5 and CXCR4 that function as HIV-1 envelope gp120 coreceptors (10) , and once colonized by HIV-1, can function as stable reservoirs of the virus, thereby facilitating transmission of HIV-1 to CD4 ϩ lymphocytes (11, 12) . Persistent evidence favors the existence of additional cofactors for binding and/or entry of HIV-1, including components of the host cell membrane acquired during viral budding (13) . Among these host-derived constituents in the viral envelope is the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS; reference 14) , which predicts a potential interactive molecule on the receptive host cell that may facilitate virus binding, entry, and/or fusion."
Perspectives of public health laboratories in emerging infectious diseases,"The world has experienced an increased incidence and transboundary spread of emerging infectious diseases over the last four decades. We divided emerging infectious diseases into four categories, with subcategories in categories 1 and 4. The categorization was based on the nature and characteristics of pathogens or infectious agents causing the emerging infections, which are directly related to the mechanisms and patterns of infectious disease emergence. The factors or combinations of factors contributing to the emergence of these pathogens vary within each category. We also classified public health laboratories into three types based on function, namely, research, reference and analytical diagnostic laboratories, with the last category being subclassified into primary (community-based) public health and clinical (medical) analytical diagnostic laboratories. The frontline/leading and/or supportive roles to be adopted by each type of public health laboratory for optimal performance to establish the correct etiological agents causing the diseases or outbreaks vary with respect to each category of emerging infectious diseases. We emphasize the need, especially for an outbreak investigation, to establish a harmonized and coordinated national public health laboratory system that integrates different categories of public health laboratories within a country and that is closely linked to the national public health delivery system and regional and international high-end laboratories.","Infectious diseases have affected humans since the first recorded history of man. Infectious diseases remain the second leading cause of death worldwide despite the recent rapid developments and advancements in modern medicine, science and biotechnology. Greater than 15 million (.25%) of an estimated 57 million deaths that occur throughout the world annually are directly caused by infectious diseases. Millions more deaths are due to the secondary effects of infections. Moreover, infectious diseases cause increased morbidity and a loss of work productivity as a result of compromised health and disability, accounting for approximately 30% of all disability-adjusted life years globally. 1, 2 Compounding the existing infectious disease burden, the world has experienced an increased incidence and transboundary spread of emerging infectious diseases due to population growth, urbanization and globalization over the past four decades. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Most of these newly emerging and re-emerging pathogens are viruses, although fewer than 200 of the approximately 1400 pathogen species recognized to infect humans are viruses. On average, however, more than two new species of viruses infecting humans are reported worldwide every year, 9 most of which are likely to be RNA viruses. 6 Emerging novel viruses are a major public health concern with the potential of causing high health and socioeconomic impacts, as has occurred with progressive pandemic infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), the recent pandemic caused by the novel quadruple re-assortment strain of influenza A virus (H1N1), and more transient events such as the outbreaks of Nipah virus in 1998/1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition, other emerging infections of regional or global interest include highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, henipavirus, Ebola virus, expanded multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, as well as acute hemorrhagic diseases caused by hantaviruses, arenaviruses and dengue viruses."
Expression of arginase I and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes of HIV-positive patients,"Arginase I (Arg I) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important in regulating immune functions through their metabolites. Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV-infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence-based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I + CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4 + T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4 + T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV.","At present, the trends in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remain at a high level worldwide (1) . The treatment of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been challenging, although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced the number of new cases of HIV infection and improved the prognosis of patients with HIV/AIDS (2) . During previous decades, there have been significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS, however certain aspects remain to be elucidated, including the functional changes in immune organs, for example the lymph nodes, following HIV infection."
Perspective Reverse vaccinology 2.0: Human immunology instructs vaccine antigen design,Nearly all licensed vaccines confer protection against infectious diseases by stimulating the production of pathogen-specific Abs by B cells. Understanding the nature of a successful Ab response is therefore a fundamental step to providing new tools for the design of novel or better vaccines. The isolation and characterization of the Ab repertoire produced by antigen-specific B cells has acquired a central importance in the last decade to unravel the response to vaccine antigens.,"Traditionally, vaccines have been developed empirically by isolating, inactivating, and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them) that cause disease (Table 1 ; Rappuoli, 2014) . Two decades ago, genome sequencing revolutionized this process, allowing for the discovery of novel vaccine antigens starting directly from genomic information. The process was named ""reverse vaccinology"" to underline that vaccine design was possible starting from sequence information without the need to grow pathogens (Rappuoli, 2000) . Indeed, a vaccine against meningococcus B, the first deriving from reverse vaccinology, has recently been licensed (Serruto et al., 2012; O'Ryan et al., 2014) . Today, a new wave of technologies in the fields of human immunology and structural biology provide the molecular information that allows for the discovery and design of vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human CMV (HCMV) that have been impossible thus far and to propose universal vaccines to tackle influenza and HIV infections. Here, we provide our perspective (summarized in Table 1 ) of how several new advances, some of which have been partially discussed elsewhere (Burton, 2002; Dormitzer et al., 2012; Haynes et al., 2012) , can be synergized to become the engine driving what might be considered a new era in vaccinology, an era in which we perform ""reverse vaccinology 2.0."" Several technological breakthroughs over the past decade have potentiated vaccine design. First, the greatly enhanced ability to clone human B cells and then to produce the corresponding recombinant mAbs or antigen-binding fragments (Fab's) has provided access to an enormously rich set of reagents that allows for the proper evaluation of the protective human immune response to any given immunogen upon immunization or infection. A fundamental step for the success of this approach has been the growing capacity to select the most favorable donors for the isolation of the most potent antibodies (Abs) through extensive examination of serum-functional Ab responses. Second, conformational epitope mapping studies, performed via improved structural biology tools for the three-dimensional characterization of Fab's complexed with their target antigens , can now readily yield the atomic details of protective epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing Abs (NAbs [bNAbs] ). Third, new computational approaches, informed by such structural and immunological data, have enabled the rational design of novel immunogens to specifically elicit a focused immune response targeting the most desirable protective epitopes (Liljeroos et al., 2015) . In addition to these advances, a great improvement in RNA sequencing technology has allowed for a massive analysis of the B cell repertoire, providing an accurate overview of the Ab maturation process generated by an infection or vaccination and driving new strategies aimed at priming the B cell precursors expressing germline-encoded Abs in an effective way before initiation of any somatic mutation."
,"The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) epidemic has brought serious social psychological impact to the Chinese people, especially those quarantined and thus with limited access to face-to-face communication and traditional social psychological interventions. To better deal with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the COVID-19 epidemic, we developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms to carry out psychological intervention to patients, their families and medical staff. We hope this model will make a sound basis for developing a more comprehensive psychological crisis intervention response system that is applicable for urgent social and psychological problems.","Since December 2019, Wuhan and gradually other places of China have experienced an outbreak of pneumonia epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2). 1 The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of 10:00 Feb 13, 2020, the epidemic has caused 1366 deaths out of 59 834 confirmed and 16 067 suspected cases. 2 Some unprecedented measures were taken to stop the spread of the virus including cancelling of gatherings, extending the Chinese New Year holidays, and limiting the number of people in public places (e.g. train stations and airports). The outbreak itself and the control measures may lead to widespread fear and panic, especially stigmatization and social exclusion of confirmed patients, survivors and relations, which may escalate into further negative psychological reactions including adjustment disorder and depression. [3] [4] [5] Sudden outbreaks of public health events always pose huge challenges to the mental health service system. Examples include the HIV/AIDS epidemic that captivated world attention in the 1980s and 1990s, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003, the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, the Ebola virus outbreak in 2013, and the Zika virus outbreak in 2016. 6 During these epidemics, the consequences on the psychosocial wellbeing of at-risk communities are sometimes largely overlooked, especially in the Ebola-affected regions, where few measures were taken to address the mental health needs of confirmed patients, their families, medical staffs or general population. 7 The absence of mental health and psychosocial support systems and the lack of well-trained psychiatrists and/or psychologists in these regions increased the risks of psychological distress and progression to psychopathology. 8 The lack of effective mental health systems added to the poverty in Sierra Leone and Liberia. 9 In China, the mental health service system has been greatly improved after several major disasters, especially the Wenchuan earthquake. In the process of dealing with group crisis intervention, various forms of psychosocial intervention services have been developed, including the intervention model of expert-coach-teacher collaboration after the Wenchuan earthquake 10 and the equilibrium psychological intervention on people injured in the disaster incident after the Lushan earthquake. 11 With the support for remote psychological intervention provided by the development of Internet technology, especially the widespread application of 4G or 5G networks and smartphones, we developed a new intervention model to handle the present COVID-19 public health event. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms."
Life-threatening influenza pneumonitis in a child with inherited IRF9 deficiency,"Life-threatening pulmonary influenza can be caused by inborn errors of type I and III IFN immunity. We report a 5-yr-old child with severe pulmonary influenza at 2 yr. She is homozygous for a loss-of-function IRF9 allele. Her cells activate gamma-activated factor (GAF) STAT1 homodimers but not IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) trimers (STAT1/STAT2/ IRF9) in response to IFN-α2b. The transcriptome induced by IFN-α2b in the patient's cells is much narrower than that of control cells; however, induction of a subset of IFN-stimulated gene transcripts remains detectable. In vitro, the patient's cells do not control three respiratory viruses, influenza A virus (IAV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These phenotypes are rescued by wild-type IRF9, whereas silencing IRF9 expression in control cells increases viral replication. However, the child has controlled various common viruses in vivo, including respiratory viruses other than IAV. Our findings show that human IRF9-and ISGF3-dependent type I and III IFN responsive pathways are essential for controlling IAV.","Influenza virus is a common pathogen in children. It typically causes self-limiting respiratory disease, but can also cause severe illness with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Short et al., 2014) . Virus strain differences can influence the frequency and severity of infections, as illustrated by seasonal epidemics and pandemics caused by new recombinant influenza viruses, but do not explain inter-individual variability in a given population infected by the same virus Morens, 2006, 2008 ; Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza et al., 2010) . Few human risk factors have been identified and consist mostly of acquired comorbidities, such as chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disease and old age (Palese and Shaw, 2007; Shieh et al., 2010; Dawood et al., 2011) . Thus, the pathogenesis of life-threatening pulmonary influenza in individuals without preexisting cardiac or pulmonary disease remains largely unexplained, especially in children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013) . Recently, we described autosomal recessive (AR), complete IRF7 deficiency as the first genetic etiology for life-threatening influenza ARDS in otherwise healthy humans . The lack of IRF7-dependent type I and type III IFN amplification by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) or pulmonary epithelial cells, or both, probably underlies this patient's susceptibility to influenza. GATA2 haploinsufficiency is the only other known inborn error of immunity underlying severe influenza, albeit in patients with multiple infections."
A novel method for synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly,"In the history of vaccine development, the synthetic vaccine is a milestone that is in stark contrast with traditional vaccines based on live-attenuated or inactivated microorganisms. Synthetic vaccines not only are safer than attenuated or inactivated microorganisms but also provide the opportunity for vaccine design for specific purposes. The first generation of synthetic vaccines has been largely based on DNA recombination technology and genetic manipulation. This de novo generation is occasionally time consuming and costly, especially in the era of genomics and when facing pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases. To accelerate and simplify the R&D process for vaccines, we developed an improved method of synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly. We optimized and employed the recently developed SpyTag/ SpyCatcher technique to establish a protein assembly system for vaccine generation from pre-prepared subunit proteins. As proof of principle, we chose a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting molecule and specific model antigens to generate desired vaccines. The results demonstrated that a new vaccine generated in this way does not hamper the individual function of different vaccine components and is efficient in inducing both T and B cell responses. This protein assembly strategy may be especially useful for high-throughput antigen screening or rapid vaccine generation.","In the history of vaccine development, the synthetic vaccine is a milestone that is in stark contrast with traditional vaccines based on live-attenuated or inactivated microorganisms.

This de novo generation is occasionally time consuming and costly, especially in the era of genomics and when facing pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases. To accelerate and simplify the R&D process for vaccines, we developed an improved method of synthetic vaccine construction based on protein assembly. We optimized and employed the recently developed SpyTag/ SpyCatcher technique to establish a protein assembly system for vaccine generation from pre-prepared subunit proteins. As proof of principle, we chose a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting molecule and specific model antigens to generate desired vaccines. The results demonstrated that a new vaccine generated in this way does not hamper the individual function of different vaccine components and is efficient in inducing both T and B cell responses. This protein assembly strategy may be especially useful for high-throughput antigen screening or rapid vaccine generation."
Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.ae Viral Profile of COPD Exacerbations According to Patients § Age §,Background: To compare the differences between elderly and non-elderly patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) due to viral infections.,"The ageing process leads to a significant decline of physiologic and morphologic functions of the human body making the elderly patients more susceptible to infections [1] . The relationship between older age and infections cannot be easily evaluated since limited data exist concerning specific conditions (e.g. severe community acquired pneumonia, nosocomial bacteremia) or subpopulations (postoperative patients) within the elderly [2] . Up to date most of the efforts are small single center cohorts that have tried to study elderly patients together with specific characteristics and risk factors associated with certain infection [3] [4] [5] ."
"NOTE First report of feline bocavirus associated with severe enteritis of cat in Northeast China, 2015","Feline bocavirus (FBoV) is a newly identified bocavirus of cats in the family Parvoviridae. A novel FBoV HRB2015-LDF was first identified from the cat with severe enteritis in Northeast China, with an overall positive rate of 2.78% (1/36). Phylogenetic and homologous analysis of the complete genome showed that FBoV HRB2015-LDF was clustered into the FBoV branch and closely related to other FBoVs, with 68.7-97.5% identities. And the genes of VP1, NPA and NS1 shared 70.7-97.6, 72.4-98.6 and 67.2-98.0% nucleotide identities with other FBoVs, respectively. The results suggested that the FBoVs could be divided into two distinct lineages, and the difference of nucleotide identities was >20-30% between the lineages.","Bocavirus belongs to the genus Bocaparvovirus, subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae, a small and non-enveloped virus approximately 25 nm in diameter [7] , with a linear single strand DNA genome of approximately 5.4 kb [1, 6] . Bocavirus are unique among Parvoviridae as they contain a third ORF between the non-structural and structural-coding regions [11, 17, 23] . Previously, the genus Bocavirus was originally named according to the initial two members, bovine parvovirus (BPV) and minute virus of canines (MVC) [2, 19, 20, 28, 29] . And now, the genus of bocavirus is reclassified as Bocaparvovirus based on the proposal of Cotmore et al [7] . Currently, the bocaparvoviruses consist of carnivore bocaparvovirus, pinniped bocaparvovirus, primate bocaparvovirus, ungulate bocaparvovirus, and unclassified bocaparvovirus [20] . And the feline bocaviruses belong to carnivore bocaparvovirus 3 and unclassified bocaparvovirus, respectively [20] ."
,"Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the nucleoside analog GS-441524 for cats suffering from various forms of naturally acquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Methods Cats ranged from 3.4-73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. Results Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2-5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3-84 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy. Conclusions and relevance GS-441524 was shown to be a safe and effective treatment for FIP. The optimum dosage was found to be 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks.","Drugs that inhibit virus replication have become mainstays in the treatment of acute and chronic RNA and DNA virus infections of people. 1 However, interest in antiviral drugs for infections of animals has been much slower to develop.

,"Cell death plays a crucial role for a myriad of physiological processes, and several human diseases such as cancer are characterized by its deregulation. There are many methods available for both quantifying and qualifying the accurate process of cell death which occurs. Choosing the right assay tool is essential to generate meaningful data, provide sufficient information for clinical applications, and understand cell death processes. In vitro cell death assays are important steps in the search for new therapies against cancer as the ultimate goal remains the elaboration of drugs that interfere with specific cell death mechanisms. However, choosing a cell viability or cytotoxicity assay among the many available options is a daunting task. Indeed, cell death can be approached by several viewpoints and require a more holistic approach. This review provides an overview of cell death assays usually used in vitro for assessing cell death so as to elaborate new potential chemotherapeutics and discusses considerations for using each assay.","Resistance to death is a major characteristic of cancer cell, hence the emergence of considerable interest in developing therapeutic strategies that could interfere with cellular death decisions. Cell death plays a major role in the homeostasis of tissues and allows the elimination of transformed cells. The deregulation of cell death in cancer implies that effective drugs have to kill cells outright and not only inhibit their growth to provide complete clinical responses. Besides, resistance to cell death during tumorigenesis may also explain tumor relapse following chemotherapeutic treatment. Thus, cell death-related assays are of primary importance in the field of oncology for drug discoveries. 1 Obviously, cell death is not unequivocal and can occur through many options. 2 Beyond semantic reasons, the ability to distinguish all forms of cell death is also clinically relevant to develop specific therapeutic drugs suitable for every cell death processes. Indeed, as the response to anticancer therapy is modulated by certain forms of cell death, specific modalities of cell death have to be identified by drug discovery assays. 3 Consequently, different in vitro methods for identifying dead cells in cell cultures have been described, including detection of end-stage cell death, irrespective of its type, as well as processes associated with a particular subroutine cell death. 4 If apoptosis, also referred to as programmed cell death, is considered as the most appropriate indicator of cell death, other categories of cell death pathways, including necrosis, autophagic cell death, and anoikis, should be of interest. As a matter of fact, if a recent classification has defined 8 different forms of cell death which may involve various molecular signaling pathways, some researchers describe that at least 11 pathways of cell death exist and that apoptotic cells frequently undergo secondary necrosis under in vitro conditions. 5, 6 It appears that apoptosis and necrosis may represent the 2 extreme types of cell death on a wide range of cell death modes. Therefore, it might be difficult to distinguish all of these specific death conditions monolithically, as differences may not be as distinct as it appears. Furthermore, appropriate cell death assays must be rigorously selected for the experimental setting under investigation; choosing the right assay tool and the appropriate end point to measure cell death is a condition sine qua non to generate meaningful data and remains a challenging task. 7 Indeed, cell death can be approached from a variety of viewpoints, including measurement of dead cells (cytotoxicity assay), quantification of live cells (viability assay), and, ultimately, determination of the accurate mechanism involved. Therefore, the plethora of strategies for monitoring cell death requires a selective choice of the best suited cell death assay according to the study aim, but a single method may not be sufficient to determine a type of cell death. 8 This review provides an overview of cell death assays currently used in vitro for estimation of cell death so as to assess Journal of Cell Death new potential chemotherapeutics and discusses the ins and outs of these scientific approaches."
Heat shock protein 90β in the Vero cell membrane binds Japanese encephalitis virus,"The pathogenesis of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is complex and unclearly defined, and in particular, the effects of the JEV receptor (JEVR) on diverse susceptible cells are elusive. In contrast to previous studies investigating JEVR in rodent or mosquito cells, in this study, we used primate Vero cells instead. We noted that few novel proteins co-immunoprecipitated with JEV, and discovered that one of these was heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β), which was probed by mass spectrometry with the highest score of 60.3 after questing the monkey and human protein databases. The specific HSP90β-JEV binding was confirmed by western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions, and this was significantly inhibited by an anti-human HSP90β monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. In addition, the results of confocal laser scanning microscopic examination demonstrated that the HSP90β-JEV binding occurred on the Vero cell surface. Finally, JEV progeny yields determined by plaque assay were also markedly decreased in siRNA-treated","Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an acute and severe viral infection of the human central nervous system that is caused by JE virus (JEV) and is transmitted between animal hosts and humans by mosquitoes (mostly of the genus Culex) (1) . It is prevalent throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and has expanded onto the Cape York Peninsula of Northern Australia (2) (3) (4) ; it has affected approximately 60% of the global population in endemic countries at risk of exposure to JEV. JE primarily occurs in children under 15 years of age and the elderly when protective immunity decreases (2, 5) . Fortunately, most JEV infections are subclinical with a symptomatic-to-asymptomatic ratio of 1:25-1,000 (6, 7) . With thebroad administration of inactivated and attenuated live vaccines, the annual JE incidence is estimated to range from 50,000-175,000 cases. Approximately 20-30% of cases are fatal, and approximately 30-50% of survivors suffer serious neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric complications several years thereafter (8) (9) (10) . Therefore, JE remains a significant health threat to the public worldwide."

Successful treatment of Providencia rettgeri cholecystitis and neutrophilic cholangitis in a cat Case Report,"Case summary A 15-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented with a recent history of seizures, diarrhoea, lethargy, fever and jaundice. Marked elevation of liver enzyme activity was present and ultrasound examination was suggestive of cholecystitis and hepatitis. Neutrophilic cholangitis was confirmed on histopathology of liver biopsies. Bile culture identified a monomicrobial infection with Providencia rettgeri, which was resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. The cat was treated with oral pradofloxacin for 4 weeks and remained well 4 months later.","Ascending bacterial infection of the biliary tract has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neutrophilic cholangitis in the cat in several studies, 1-3 and the disease parallels acute cholangitis in people. Enteric pathogens have been implicated in the pathogenesis of disease in both cats and people, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and recent literature in humans suggests high rates of antimicrobial resistance. [6] [7] [8] [9] Providencia rettgeri is an unusual pathogen in humans, mostly associated with urinary tract infections, [10] [11] [12] and has been reported as the cause of a urinary tract infection in a dog. 13 Other Providencia species have been reported in association with diarrhoea and skin disease in dogs. 14, 15 To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Providencia species causing clinical disease in a cat. A 15- year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented after a generalised seizure was observed at home. A second seizure was observed after admission to hospital. Occasional vomiting and soft faecal consistency had been present over the previous week. The cat had indoor and outdoor access, and was fed a commercial, complete and balanced cat food."

B R I E F C O M M U N I C AT I O N Gain-of-function experiments with bacteriophage lambda uncover residues under diversifying selection in nature,"Viral gain-of-function mutations frequently evolve during laboratory experiments. Whether the specific mutations that evolve in the lab also evolve in nature and whether they have the same impact on evolution in the real world is unknown. We studied a model virus, bacteriophage λ, that repeatedly evolves to exploit a new host receptor under typical laboratory conditions. Here, we demonstrate that two residues of λ's J protein are required for the new function. In natural λ variants, these amino acid sites are highly diverse and evolve at high rates. Insertions and deletions at these locations are associated with phylogenetic patterns indicative of ecological diversification. Our results show that viral evolution in the laboratory mirrors that in nature and that laboratory experiments can be coupled with protein sequence analyses to identify the causes of viral evolution in the real world. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for widespread host-shift evolution in lambdoid viruses. K E Y W O R D S : Experimental evolution, gain-of-function, host shift, genomic epidemiology, natural variation, synthetic biology.","Many viruses can expand their host range with a few mutations (Imai et al. 2012; Meyer et al. 2012; Longdon et al. 2014 ) that enable the exploitation of new receptors (Imai et al. 2012; Meyer et al. 2012) .

Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus in client-owned cats in New Zealand,"Objectives The objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence, testing and vaccination practices, and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in New Zealand Methods A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-16) and 650 days (95% CI 431-993), respectively. Conclusions and relevance Testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV in New Zealand appears targeted towards high-risk animals, which may bias prevalence estimates. Baseline data should be monitored for changes in FeLV epidemiology now commercial vaccines are no longer available.","Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are important pathogens causing clinical disease in domestic cats worldwide. 1 The prevalences reported in the literature vary widely depending on the geographical location and clinical characteristics of the study populations, 2 with infections less commonly reported in healthy cats and confined cats compared with clinically unwell cats and free-roaming cats. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Both viruses spread directly through bite wounds. 3, 9, 10 Sexual contact, vertical transmission and social interactions such as mutual grooming or shared food or water dishes are more important transmission pathways for FeLV than FIV. 11, 12 Unsurprisingly, cats that are aggressive, sexually intact, frequently in contact with other cats or observed fighting have been identified as being significantly more likely to test positive for either pathogen. 8, [13] [14] [15] Experimental studies have shown that susceptibility to FeLV decreases significantly with age, with almost 100% of newborn kittens developing persistent viraemia after inoculation vs only 15% of kittens over 4 months of age. 16, 17 Since there are currently no effective treatments for FeLV and FIV, 18 the cornerstone of disease management in clinical practice is preventing new infections through vaccination or segregation. 19 Many cats diagnosed with FeLV die or are euthanased within 2-3 years owing to clinical complications, 20 while FIV-positive cats can remain asymptomatic for many years. 21, 22 Diagnostic testing is therefore important for determining the infection status of cats to inform clinical decisions, 23 but may not be performed routinely in private practice. 24 FeLV and FIV are both endemic in the New Zealand domestic cat population, yet relatively little is known about their epidemiology. Two studies published in the early 1980s reported the prevalence of FeLV in cattery populations at between 4.4% and 11%, 25, 26 while another more recent study from 2013 estimated the national prevalences of FeLV and FIV at 5.5% and 10%, respectively, based on 200 blood samples submitted to a commercial diagnostic laboratory for routine haematological testing. 27 There has also been some recent work to characterise the molecular epidemiology of FIV in New Zealand to determine whether the commercially available vaccine is likely to be effective against the currently circulating subtypes. 28, 29 However, since vaccination against FIV is relatively uncommon in New Zealand, 30 and the last commercially available vaccine for FeLV was removed from the domestic market in March 2016 owing to low sale volumes, these tools are not currently being utilised to protect patient populations. Gathering better baseline data on disease occurrence, risk factors and clinical outcomes will be important for guiding discussions on how we can better manage these diseases moving forward."
Ebola Preparedness in the Netherlands: The Need for Coordination Between the Public Health and the Curative Sector,"Context: During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015, close cooperation between the curative sector and the public health sector in the Netherlands was necessary for timely identification, referral, and investigation of patients with suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD). Objective: In this study, we evaluated experiences in preparedness among stakeholders of both curative and public health sectors to formulate recommendations for optimizing preparedness protocols. Timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD was used as indicator for preparedness. Design: In focus group sessions and semistructured interviews, experiences of curative and public health stakeholders about the regional and national process of preparedness and response were listed. Timeliness recordings of all referred patients with suspected EVD (13) were collected from first date of illness until arrival in the referral academic hospital. Results: Ebola preparedness was considered extensive compared with the risk of an actual patient, however necessary. Regional coordination varied between regions. More standardization of regional preparation and operational guidelines was requested, as well as nationally standardized contingency criteria, and the National Centre for Infectious Disease Control was expected to coordinate the development of these guidelines. For the timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD, the median delay between first date of illness until triage was 2.0 days (range: 0-10 days), and between triage and arrival in the referral hospital, it was 5.0 hours (range: 2-7.5 hours). In none of these patients Ebola infection was confirmed. Conclusions: Coordination between the public health sector and the curative sector needs improvement to reduce delay in patient management in emerging infectious diseases. Standardization of preparedness and response practices, through guidelines for institutional preparedness and blueprints for regional and national coordination, is necessary, as preparedness for emerging infectious diseases needs a multidisciplinary approach overarching both the public health sector and the curative sector. In the Netherlands a national platform for preparedness is established, in which both the curative sector and public health sector participate, in order to implement the outcomes of this study.",and to facilitate implementation of CID policy in the PHSs regions.

TLR9 agonists induced cell death in Burkitt's lymphoma cells is variable and influenced by TLR9 polymorphism,"Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) triggering is a promising novel strategy to combat cancer as it induces innate and adaptive immunity responses. B-cell lymphoma is unique in this context as tumor cells express TLR9 and may harbor latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gamma-herpesvirus with remarkable oncogenic potential when latent. Latent EBV may be promoted by TLR9 triggering via suppression of lytic EBV. Here, we elaborated an initial assessment of the impact of TLR9 triggering on EBV-positive and EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma using Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines as an in vitro model. We show that, independent of the presence of EBV, the TLR9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) CpG-2006 may or may not induce caspase-dependent cell death in BL cells. Moreover, ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death responses of BL cells were associated with TLR9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs5743836 or rs352140, which we detected in primary BL tumors and in peripheral blood from healthy individuals at similar frequencies. Thus, our findings suggest that the effect of TLR9 agonists on BL cells should be tested in vitro before installment of therapy and TLR9 SNPs in BL patients should be determined as potential biological markers for the therapeutic response to treatment targeting innate immunity.","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important players of the innate immune system, 1 and expression of the 10 TLRs known in humans 2,3 depends on the cell subset and differentiation status. [4] [5] [6] TLR9 is preferentially expressed by B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (reviewed in reference Iwasaki and Medzhitov 1 ). Synthetic TLR9 ligands, short oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with unmethylated CpG motifs, 7 activate TLR9 that recruits the adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and induces a cascade leading to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). 2 The immune response following TLR9 engagement is highly desirable for cancer treatment. 8 Synthetic TLR9 agonists are regarded as potential anti-cancer agents. Clinical trials have shown promising results for the treatment of various cancer types with CpG ODNs. 9 Their effects can be indirect by enhancing the anti-tumor immune response or direct by inducing apoptosis in the malignant cells. Direct effects would be expected for B-cell malignancies as they express TLR9. B-cell activation can eventually lead to activation-induced cell death of cancer cells and therefore support anti-cancer treatment. 10 Nevertheless, the TLR9 agonist effects vary strongly between B-cell cancer types, and the responses of B-cell lymphomas to ODN CpG-2006 show high variability. 11 Thus, the effects of CpG ODNs on B-cell malignancies are not predictable. Moreover, CpG ODN treatment has tumor-promoting effects on benign B cells and strongly enhances their proliferation and differentiation. [12] [13] [14] Stimulation of TLR9 with ODN CpG-2006 suppresses lytic reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a B-cell tropic gamma-herpesvirus, and can thereby promote latent EBV. 15, 16 The latter is associated with several types of B-cell lymphomas including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). 17 EBV is present in nearly all cases of the high-incidence form of BL ('endemic BL'), in up to 85% of the intermediate-incidence cases, and in 15% of the low-incidence cases ('sporadic' BL). Up to 40% of BL in human immunodeficiency virus carriers harbor EBV. 17 As latent EBV exhibits unique growth transformation potential on B cells in vitro 18 and TLR9 triggering enhances EBV-induced B-cell transformation 19 and promotes latent EBV in vitro, 15, 16 TLR9 stimulation in the treatment of EBV-positive BL could provoke detrimental rather than beneficial outcomes."
The potential contributions of traditional Chinese medicine to emergency medicine,BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been developed and used to treat acute and urgent illness for many thousands of years. TCM has been widely perceived in western societies that TCM may only be effective to treat chronic diseases. The aim of this article is to provide some scientifi c evidence regarding the application of TCM in emergency medicine and its future potential.,"Australian College of Emergency Medicine-ACEM [1] defines emergency medicine as ""Emergency medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of episodic undifferentiated physical and behavioral disorders; it further encompasses an understanding of the development of prehospital and inhospital emergency medical systems and the skills necessary for this development."""
"Potential risk of viral transmission from flying foxes to domestic animals and humans on the southern coast of West Java, Indonesia","Flying foxes have been considered to be involved in the transmission of serious infectious diseases to humans. Using questionnaires, we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an Indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area. We surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in West Java. Villages were classified into 3 groups: inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1-5 km or 5-10 km away from the reserve's outer border. Data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics (age, sex and occupation); histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans, dogs and other domestic animals; and knowledge about infectious diseases, mainly rabies, in flying foxes. We found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food, especially during the fruit season. In these residential areas, flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals, especially dogs. People who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment, such as leather gloves, goggles and caps. The residents living around the conservation area mostly had poor knowledge about flying foxes and disease transmission. This situation shows that the population in this region is at a quite high risk for contracting infectious diseases from flying foxes.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. to hunt wild boars or as guard dogs, such that the population of dogs in Garut is comparatively high in Indonesia.

Braess's Paradox in Epidemic Game: Better Condition Results in Less Payoff,"Facing the threats of infectious diseases, we take various actions to protect ourselves, but few studies considered an evolving system with competing strategies. In view of that, we propose an evolutionary epidemic model coupled with human behaviors, where individuals have three strategies: vaccination, self-protection and laissez faire, and could adjust their strategies according to their neighbors' strategies and payoffs at the beginning of each new season of epidemic spreading. We found a counter-intuitive phenomenon analogous to the well-known Braess's Paradox, namely a better condition may lead to worse performance. Specifically speaking, increasing the successful rate of self-protection does not necessarily reduce the epidemic size or improve the system payoff. The range and degree of the Braess's Paradox are sensitive to both the parameters characterizing the epidemic spreading and the strategy payoff, while the existence of the Braess's Paradox is insensitive to the network topologies. This phenomenon can be well explained by a mean-field approximation. Our study demonstrates an important fact that a better condition for individuals may yield a worse outcome for the society.","R ecent outbreaks of global infectious diseases, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), H1N1 (Swine Influenza) and H5H1 (Avian Influenza), have caused major public healthy threats owing to their potential mortalities and substantial economic impacts. According to the report of WHO, infectious diseases cause more than 10 million deaths annually and accounting for 23% of the global disease burden 1 . Various interventions thus have been developed to control infectious diseases, such as vaccination, treatment, quarantining and behavior change programs (e.g., social distancing and partner reduction) 2 ."
The influence of strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors on depressive symptoms and suicidality-a population-based study in Korean adults,"Suicide is the outcome of the interaction of biological, personal, and social risk factors. The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors on suicidality, and the mediating effect of depressive symptoms in relationship between strain related to individual risk factors and social risk factors and suicidality. The data from sociopsychological anxiety survey of Korea society conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs in 2015 were used in verifying the model. We analyzed the data of 7000 adults aged 19 to 79 years using Structural Equation Modeling. Strain due to individual risk factors was positively related to depressive symptoms and suicidality. Interestingly, strain induced by social risk factors was positively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. Social support is significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. Depressive symptoms directly affected suicidality. In addition, strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors indirectly affected suicidality mediating depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that not only individual efforts such as social interaction and depression prevention but also government efforts such as preparation for aging may be needed to decrease suicide rate.","Numerous studies have focused on individual risk factors in understanding suicide. [1] [2] [3] However, suicide is the result of interactions of biological, individual, and social risk factors in addition to absence of protective factors such as social support. [4] On the basis of this assumption, Zhang [5] suggested that various strain factors influence directly suicide, and that strain factors affect indirectly suicide-mediating psychiatric disorders such as depression. In addition, the author emphasized that social and psychological protective factors involve in the process of strain factors inducing suicide."
Induction of PrP Sc -specific systemic and mucosal immune responses in white-tailed deer with an oral vaccine for chronic wasting disease,"The ongoing epidemic of chronic wasting disease (CWD) within cervid populations indicates the need for novel approaches for disease management. A vaccine that either reduces susceptibility to infection or reduces shedding of prions by infected animals, or a combination of both, could be of benefit for disease control. The development of such a vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of prion diseases and the requirement for formulation and delivery in an oral format for application in wildlife settings. To address the unique nature of prions, our group targets epitopes, termed disease specific epitopes (DSEs), whose exposure for antibody binding depends on diseaseassociated misfolding of PrP C into PrP Sc . Here, a DSE corresponding to the rigid loop (RL) region, which was immunogenic following parenteral vaccination, was translated into an oral vaccine. This vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent human adenovirus expressing a truncated rabies glycoprotein G recombinant fusion with the RL epitope (hAd5:tgG-RL). Oral immunization of white-tailed deer with hAd5:tgG-RL induced PrP Sc -specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses with an encouraging safety profile in terms of no adverse health effects nor prolonged vector shedding. By building upon proven strategies of formulation for wildlife vaccines, these efforts generate a particular PrP Sc -specific oral vaccine for CWD as well as providing a versatile Correspondence to: Scott Napper; 120 Veterinary Road, platform, in terms of carrier protein and biological vector, for generation of other oral, peptide-based CWD vaccines.","Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that is currently spreading through North American cervid populations. 1 Incidence of CWD has largely been limited to North America, but reported cases in South Korea and Norway indicate the potential for global consequences. 2,3 CWD has had a devastating impact on the farmed elk industry and its ongoing spread through wild populations threatens a natural resource that is of considerable economic, ecological and social importance. The circumstantial evidence that human prion diseases can result from exposure to CWD, as well as a recent demonstration of oral transmission of CWD to cynomolgus macaques, add concern of the zoonotic potential of CWD. 4, 5 At the current time, culling is the primary tool available for management of CWD. While there has been some success in limiting the spread of CWD in wild populations through strategic culling, this is an incomplete and controversial strategy for long-term disease management. 6, 7 Management of CWD, in particular within wild populations, will likely depend on the coordinated application of several disease management strategies. One important component of this strategy may be the use of vaccines to either reduce PrP Sc shedding or prevent infection. In particular, the unique ability of prions to cause long-term environmental contamination, lasting from years to decades, supports vaccination as a strategy to both achieve prophylactic prevention and reduce shedding towards mitigating exposure and infection of animals in contaminated environments. 8, 9 Emerging evidence of the uptake and presentation of environmentally-shed prions by plants further support the importance of limiting shedding by infected animals. 10 Development of a prion vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of the infectious agent; the misfolding of a self-protein (PrP C ) into an infectious and pathological conformation (PrP Sc ). 11 While an effective vaccine for CWD remains elusive, there is proof of principle evidence that this is an achievable goal as antibodies to PrP C neutralize prion propagation in vitro and in vivo. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Numerous studies have shown the benefits of immunization to abrogate infectivity, reduce PrP Sc loads within relevant tissue, increase survival time, and provide partial protection following infection. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Further, the paradigms of vaccine success are shifting such that reduced shedding, rather than outright prevention of infection, may be a relevant and achievable measure of vaccine efficacy."
"Drug Design, Development and Therapy Dovepress Xyloketal B, a marine compound, acts on a network of molecular proteins and regulates the activity and expression of rat cytochrome P450 3a: a bioinformatic and animal study","Natural compounds are becoming popular for the treatment of illnesses and health promotion, but the mechanisms of action and safety profiles are often unknown. Xyloketal B (XKB) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. However, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of XKB using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of XKB on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. DDI-CPI, a server that can predict drug-drug interactions via the chemical-protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of XKB, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of XKB. Homology modeling was performed using the Discovery Studio program 3.1. The activity and expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with XKB at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1′-OH-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by XKB. A molecular docking study showed that XKB bound to the active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. The in vivo study showed that oral administration of XKB at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and AUC ratio of 1′-OH-midazolam over midazolam. Further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg XKB for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic Cyp3a in rats. Taken together, the results show that XKB could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that XKB downregulated hepatic Cyp3a in rats. XKB might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of Cyp3a members. More studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of XKB and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of XKB on Cyp3a subfamily members.

To establish the dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships of XKB, we investigated its metabolism and PKs in rats. In vivo, the plasma PKs of XKB followed a two-compartment model with a distribution phase and an elimination phase. 22 XKB showed a short elimination half-life (22-27 minutes) , suggesting that it was rapidly distributed in the body and also rapidly eliminated. However, the molecular targets in response to XKB treatment and the effect of XKB on regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown."
Alu RNA regulates the cellular pool of active ribosomes by targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to 40S subunits,"The human genome contains about 1.5 million Alu elements, which are transcribed into Alu RNAs by RNA polymerase III. Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mR-NAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.","Translation regulation ensures protein homeostasis under normal growth conditions. In addition, modulating the translation efficiency of already existing mRNAs provides a rapid mechanism for adapting protein expression in development, memory formation, synaptic plasticity and in response to stress and apoptotic signals. Although transla-tional control may occur at different steps during protein synthesis, the majority of the mechanisms target translation initiation (1, 2) ."
Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus cases in tertiary hospitals in Hubei Province,"Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. Methods: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. Results: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cordlike shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. Conclusions: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.","In late 2019, Wuhan in Hubei province, China became the focus of the world owing to an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown etiology. A pathogen was successfully isolated on January 12, 2020 and named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). [1] As of 6:00 PM Beijing time on January 26, 2020, there are more than 2000 confirmed cases worldwide, with over half from Hubei province. Here, we report the clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimen of 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of several tertiary hospitals in Hubei to provide a basis for further specification of the diagnosis and treatment protocol for this disease."
"Demographic, etiological, and histological pulmonary analysis of patients with acute respiratory failure: a study of 19 years of autopsies","INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory failure has been one of the most important causes of death in intensive care units, and certain aspects of its pulmonary pathology are currently unknown.","Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a major cause of death in patients with a variety of primary underlying diseases. In addition, the prevalences of comorbidities and mortality have been reported to be higher than 40-50% in ARF patients, especially in those with diffuse infiltrates as seen on chest X-rays. [1] [2] [3] The clinical and radiological findings in ARF are nonspecific, [4] [5] [6] and prompt investigation and diagnosis are essential to improving patient survival. [7] [8] [9] In this context, the complexity of clinical presentations makes diagnosis a constant challenge for the clinician. Despite recent advances, most types of diagnostic support are still expensive. Clinicians often initiate treatment to avoid the rapid progression of the disease and to spare the patient from more invasive procedures. Therefore, it is important to determine the leading causes of death in this population to establish correct prophylactic actions, which is the least expensive strategy for preventing further pulmonary dysfunction and avoiding the need for lung biopsies. 10 We performed a retrospective study of 4,710 autopsies on patients whose cause of death was ARF to better describe the demographic and etiological data and the associated histological pulmonary findings and diseases."
A large and accurate collection of peptidase cleavages in the MEROPS database,"Peptidases are enzymes that hydrolyse peptide bonds in proteins and peptides. Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as 'physiological' is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.","Peptidases (proteases or proteinases) are enzymes that hydrolyse the peptide bonds between amino acids in a protein or peptide chain. Hydrolysis of such bonds is required for removal of targeting signals (signal and transit peptides (1), ubiquitin (2), SUMO (3) and NEDD8 (4) peptides), the release of a mature protein from its precursor (5) , the switching off of a biological signal by degradation of the signal protein (6) , and for widespread catabolism of proteins for recycling of the amino acids. When proteolysis occurs unchecked, then diseases can result, such as Alzheimer's (7) , osteoarthritis (8) , emphysema (9) , tumour invasion (10) and acute pancreatitis (11) . Pathogens use peptidases to enter the host and to degrade host proteins for food (12) ."
"Phylogenetic Distribution of CMP-Neu5Ac Hydroxylase (CMAH), the Enzyme Synthetizing the Proinflammatory Human Xenoantigen Neu5Gc","The enzyme CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) is responsible for the synthesis of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a sialic acid present on the cell surface proteins of most deuterostomes. The CMAH gene is thought to be present in most deuterostomes, but it has been inactivated in a number of lineages, including humans. The inability of humans to synthesize Neu5Gc has had several evolutionary and biomedical implications. Remarkably, Neu5Gc is a xenoantigen for humans, and consumption of Neu5Gc-containing foods, such as red meats, may promote inflammation, arthritis, and cancer. Likewise, xenotransplantation of organs producing Neu5Gc can result in inflammation and organ rejection. Therefore, knowing what animal species contain a functional CMAH gene, and are thus capable of endogenous Neu5Gc synthesis, has potentially far-reaching implications. In addition to humans, other lineages are known, or suspected, to have lost CMAH; however, to date reports of absent and pseudogenic CMAH genes are restricted to a handful of species. Here, we analyze all available genomic data for nondeuterostomes, and 322 deuterostome genomes, to ascertain the phylogenetic distribution of CMAH. Among nondeuterostomes, we found CMAH homologs in two green algae and a few prokaryotes. Within deuterostomes, putatively functional CMAH homologs are present in 184 of the studied genomes, and a total of 31 independent gene losses/pseudogenization events were inferred. Our work produces a list of animals inferred to be free from endogenous Neu5Gc based on the absence of CMAH homologs and are thus potential candidates for human consumption, xenotransplantation research, and model organisms for investigation of human diseases.","Sialic acids are a family of more than 50 nine-carbon sugars that are typically found at the terminal ends of N-glycans, Oglycans, and glycosphingolipids that are secreted or attached to the cell membrane. They are involved in recognition processes, frequently serving as ligands for receptor-mediated interactions that enable intercellular or host-pathogen recognition. Sialic acids may also function as a class of ""self-associated molecular patterns"" (SAMPs), whose presence/absence in a species serves as a signal to modulate innate immune responses (Varki 2011) . Sialic acids are found predominantly in deuterostomes (the group including chordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms), being uncommon in other organisms (Warren 1963; Corfield and Schauer 1982; Staudacher et al. 1999; Angata and Varki 2002; Schauer 2004) ."
"Personal, Occupational, and Public Health Perspectives on Dealing with the First Case of Influenza A (H1N1) in the United Arab Emirates","New epidemics of infectious diseases often involve health care workers. In this short communication we present a case report of a health care professional who became the fi rst case of infl uenza H1N1 virus to be notifi ed in the United Arab Emirates. There are several issues related to workplace considerations and general public health, including preventive measures, the need for isolation of the patient, dealing with contacts, return to work, and communication with the workforce.","In recent years influenza viruses have circulated in seasonal (H3N2, H1N1) and avian (including H5N1) forms. There has been concern that Influenza A (H5N1), a worldwide cause of large poultry outbreaks, which by December 2009 had affected 467 persons (282 deaths), would drift or shift to become the next pandemic strain [1] . However in April 2009 'Swine flu' caused by a new strain of influenza A, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 emerged."
New Respiratory Viruses and the Elderly,"The diagnostics of respiratory viral infections has improved markedly during the last 15 years with the development of PCR techniques. Since 1997, several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered: influenza A viruses H5N1 and H1N1, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses SARS, NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus, human rhinoviruses C and D and potential respiratory pathogens, the KI and WU polyomaviruses and the torque teno virus. The detection of previously known viruses has also improved. Currently, a viral cause of respiratory illness is almost exclusively identifiable in children, but in the elderly, the detection rates of a viral etiology are below 40%, and this holds also true for exacerbations of chronic respiratory illnesses. The new viruses cause respiratory symptoms like the common cold, cough, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure may occur. These viruses are distributed throughout the globe and affect people of all ages. Data regarding these viruses and the elderly are scarce. This review introduces these new viruses and reviews their clinical significance, especially with regard to the elderly population.","Life expectancy has increased globally over the past two centuries by almost 30 years [1] and only over the last five decades by almost 20 years. This very recent phenomenon emerged as a consequence of improvements in nutrition, hygiene, antimicrobial therapy and vaccinations [2, 3] . The development of antiviral therapy, has, however, lagged behind. In the elderly, respiratory viral infections still cause significant morbidity and mortality: up to 40% of nonpneumonic lower respiratory illnesses have been linked to respiratory viral infection, and in USA alone, an estimated 54,000 annual deaths have been attributed to the influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ."
ABSTRACTS C01 Pharmacodynamics of Entresto® (Sacubitril/Valsartan) Versus Placebo in Dogs with Preclinical Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease C02 Trimethylamine-N-Oxide and its Precursors in Dogs with Degenerative Mitral Valve Disease Comparison Between the Effects of Torsemide and Furosemide on the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System of Normal Dogs C04 Transvenous Echocardiography in Conscious Sedated Horses C06 Complications and Outcomes of Multi-Institution Transvenous Pacemaker Implantation,"Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are standard of care for treatment of congestive heart failure, but aldosterone breakthrough occurs when ACEi are used in both dogs and humans. Entresto®, a combinational angiotensin-receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor, showed superiority in reducing mortality in human patients with heart failure compared to enalapril. Pharmacodynamics of Entresto® have been evaluated in healthy dogs, showing efficacy in altering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) without causing adverse effects. The aim of this prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effects of Entresto® to placebo in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and to evaluate the safety profile of Entresto® in dogs with cardiac disease. Client-owned dogs weighing 4-15 kg with ACVIM Stage B2 MMVD were enrolled. Dogs with clinically significant pulmonary hypertension or systemic disease were excluded, as were dogs on any medication(s) known to alter the RAAS. All dogs received pimobendan throughout the study period. Each patient was evaluated at three time points (Day 0, Day 7, and Day 30). Echocardiography, thoracic radiographs (CXR), Doppler systemic arterial pressure (SAP), complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration, and urinary aldosterone to creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) were evaluated on Day 0. On Day 0, each dog was randomly allocated to a treatment group (Entresto®; 20 mg/kg BID) or a placebo group by the attending pharmacist. Investigators, veterinary technicians, and owners were blinded to treatment. Serum renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations and SAP were rechecked on Day 7. Echocardiography, CXR, SAP, renal panel, plasma NT-proBNP concentration, and UAldo:C were rechecked on Day 30. Thirteen dogs were recruited: Entresto® (n = 7) and placebo (n = 6). The median percent increase in UAldo:C between Day 0 and Day 30 was significantly lower in the Entresto® group (12%; P = 0.032) as compared to the placebo group (195%). The median percent decrease of NT-proBNP concentration from Day 0 to Day 30 was not statistically different between groups (P = 0.68). No statistical differences were seen in echocardiographic, CXR, SAP, or biochemical profiles measured at any time point between groups. No adverse events were noted by the owners for dogs in either group. This study suggests that Entresto® efficiently inhibits RAAS in dogs with cardiomegaly secondary to MMVD in comparison to placebo. Entresto® is safe in regards to SAP and renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations. No adverse effects were noted in any dog taking Entresto®. Future studies comparing Entresto® to ACEi, evaluating the concomitant use of diuretics and Entresto®, and evaluating longterm (> 30 days) effects of Entresto® are warranted. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the oxidized product of trimethylamine, is produced by gastrointestinal microbiota from certain dietary nutrients including choline and L-carnitine. Elevated plasma concentrations of TMAO, choline, and L-carnitine have been shown to be associated with the presence and severity of cardiovascular disease in people and are independent predictors of adverse cardiac events and mortality. This prospective study investigated whether there are differences in concentrations of circulating TMAO, choline, or L-carnitine in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to healthy controls (Controls).","The objective was to assess the diagnostic utility and feasibility of using a 3-10MHz, 8 French, 90cm intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheter (Acuson AcuNav®) to evaluate cardiac structures and function in conscious horses sedated with xylazine."
"Murine AKAP7 Has a 2=,5=-Phosphodiesterase Domain That Can Complement an Inactive Murine Coronavirus ns2 Gene","Viral 2=,5=-phosphodiesterases (2=,5=-PDEs) help disparate RNA viruses evade the antiviral activity of interferon (IFN) by degrading 2=,5=-oligoadenylate (2-5A) activators of RNase L. A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) to localize and organize cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling during diverse physiological processes. Among more than 43 AKAP isoforms, AKAP7 appears to be unique in its homology to viral 2=,5=-PDEs. Here we show that mouse AKAP7 rapidly degrades 2-5A with kinetics similar to that of murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3 proteins. To determine whether AKAP7 could substitute for a viral 2=,5=-PDE, we inserted AKAP7 cDNA into an MHV genome with an inactivated ns2 gene. The AKAP7 PDE domain or N-terminally truncated AKAP7 (both lacking a nuclear localization motif), but not full-length AKAP7 or a mutant, AKAP7 H185R , PDE domain restored the infectivity of ns2 mutant MHV in bone marrow macrophages and in livers of infected mice. Interestingly, the AKAP7 PDE domain and N-terminally deleted AKAP7 were present in the cytoplasm (the site of MHV replication), whereas full-length AKAP7 was observed only in nuclei. We suggest the possibility that viral acquisition of the host AKAP7 PDE domain might have occurred during evolution, allowing diverse RNA viruses to antagonize the RNase L pathway.","H ost antiviral pathways triggered by type I interferons (IFNs) are self-limiting so that after virus is eliminated, the host can restore normal cellular and tissue functions (1) . Many types of viruses also prevent activation of host antiviral pathways (reviewed in reference 2). The 2=,5=-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)/RNase L system is one of the principal mediators of the IFN antiviral response (reviewed in references 3 to 6). Recently, we reported that two homologous viral proteins from unrelated viruses, coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 ns2 and group A rotavirus strain SA11 VP3, have 2=,5=phosphodiesterase (2=,5=-PDE) activities that antagonize the antiviral activity of RNase L by degrading 2-5A [p x (5=A2=p) n 5=A, where x is 1 to 3 and n is 2 or greater] (7, 8) . ns2 and VP3 are eukaryotic-viral LigT-like family members that include both viral and cellular proteins of diverse origins, some of which possess cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPD) activity ( Fig. 1A) (9) . LigT proteins are named for the prototypical archeo-bacterial tRNA-ligating enzyme LigT with reversible 2=-5=-RNA ligase activity (10) and are part of a larger superfamily of 2H phosphoesterases characterized by the presence of a pair of conserved His-h-Thr/Ser-h motifs (where h is typically a hydrophobic residue) (9, 11, 12) . However, while MHV ns2 has 2=,5=-PDE activity, it apparently lacks CPD activity based on its inability to cleave 2=,3= cyclic AMP (cAMP), 3=,5= cAMP, and ADP-ribose 1Љ,2Љ cyclic phosphate (7) . Mutation of the active site of ns2 blocked MHV replication in liver, thereby preventing hepatitis in wild-type (wt) mice but not in RNasel Ϫ/Ϫ mice (7) . Furthermore, the group A rotavirus (strain SA11) VP3 C-terminal domain (CTD) was able to restore the replication and virulence of a chimeric ns2 mutant MHV in mice (8) , showing that these two virally encoded activities are functionally equivalent. Homologous PDEs encoded by other 2a betacoronaviruses, toroviruses, and group A rotaviruses suggest that this is a general mechanism of host antagonism necessary for replication of many RNA viruses (5, 8, 9, 11; unpublished data) ."
Targeting regenerative exosomes to myocardial infarction using cardiac homing peptide,"Rationale: Cardiac stem cell-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to promote cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction in preclinical studies. Recent studies have used intramyocardial injection in order to concentrate exosomes in the infarct. Though effective in a research setting, this method is not clinically appealing due to its invasive nature. We propose the use of a targeting peptide, cardiac homing peptide (CHP), to target intravenously-infused exosomes to the infarcted heart. Methods: Exosomes were conjugated with CHP through a DOPE-NHS linker. Ex vivo targeting was analyzed by incubating organ sections with the CHP exosomes and analyzing with fluorescence microscopy. In vitro assays were performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells. For the animal study, we utilized an ischemia/reperfusion rat model. Animals were treated with either saline, scramble peptide exosomes, or CHP exosomes 24 h after surgery. Echocardiography was performed 4 h after surgery and 21 d after surgery. At 21 d, animals were sacrificed, and organs were collected for analysis. Results: By conjugating the exosomes with CHP, we demonstrate increased retention of the exosomes within heart sections ex vivo and in vitro with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In vitro studies showed improved viability, reduced apoptosis and increased exosome uptake when using CHP-XOs. Using an animal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we measured the heart function, infarct size, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, with improved outcomes with the CHP exosomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a novel method for increasing delivery of for treatment of myocardial infarction. By targeting exosomes to the infarcted heart, there was a significant improvement in outcomes with reduced fibrosis and scar size, and increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.","Due to the limited regeneration of cardiomyocytes [1] , stem cells have been the premier choice for promoting myocardial regeneration."

"Specific Single or Double Proline Substitutions in the ""Spring-loaded"" Coiled-Coil Region of the Influenza Hemagglutinin Impair or Abolish Membrane Fusion Activity","We tested the role of the ""spring-loaded"" conformational change in the fusion mechanism of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) by assessing the effects of 10 point mutants in the region of high coiled-coil propensity, HA2 54-81. The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction ( ‫ف‬ 60-80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion. An alternate model is discussed.","We tested the role of the ""spring-loaded"" conformational change in the fusion mechanism of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) by assessing the effects of 10 point mutants in the region of high coiled-coil propensity, HA2 54-81.

Surveillance of Australian Hajj pilgrims for carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria: Data from two pilot studies World Journal of Clinical Cases,"To estimate the pharyngeal carriage rate of Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis ), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae ) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ) among Australian Hajj pilgrims.","Hajj is one of the world's largest annual mass gatherings, attracting approximately 2-3 million people each year from around the globe. During Hajj there is a high risk of communicable diseases, primarily due to overcrowding, shared accommodation and mingling of local and international pilgrims [1, 2] . The importation of pathogens from arriving pilgrims may result in local transmission of infection within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Similarly, there may be further dissemination of infectious diseases after pilgrims return home."
Rotavirus vaccine efficacy: current status and areas for improvement,"The difference noted in Rotavirus vaccine efficiency between high and low income countries correlates with the lack of universal access to clean water and higher standards of hygiene. Overcoming these obstacles will require great investment and also time, therefore more effective vaccines should be developed to meet the needs of those who would benefit the most from them. Increasing our current knowledge of mucosal immunity, response to Rotavirus infection and its modulation by circadian rhythms could point at actionable pathways to improve vaccination efficacy, especially in the case of individuals affected by environmental enteropathy. Also, a better understanding and validation of Rotavirus entry factors as well as the systematic monitoring of dominant strains could assist in tailoring vaccines to individual's needs. Another aspect that could improve vaccine efficiency is targeting to M cells, for which new ligands could potentially be sought. Finally, alternative mucosal adjuvants and vaccine expression, storage and delivery systems could have a positive impact in the outcome of Rotavirus vaccination.","Vaccines are generally accepted as one of the most successful prophylactic interventions in history. Their development requires sustained efforts in research to improve efficacy and mitigate risks. Oral vaccines have great benefits as they can be administered more easily which can be critical especially during large, mass vaccination campaigns in developing nations. It is well established that environmental factors such as climate, poverty, nutrition and diseases take a great toll in the efficiency of vaccines. These circumstances can have a big impact on underprivileged populations, especially in developing nations. It can be argued that many healthcare solutions, most of which were originally developed to address the needs of higher income nations, are inadequate to the realities faced in developing countries. This can be inferred for instance from studies on the outcome of oral vaccines in such contrasting settings. In that regard, Environmental Enteropathy (EE) is believed to play a very significant, if not critical role."

The usefulness of hand washing during field training to prevent acute respiratory illness in a military training facility Observational Study Medicine ® OPEN 1,"Hand washing plays a key role in preventing respiratory infection in many clinical settings. However, its effectiveness in preventing acute respiratory illness (ARI) during field training in military training facilities has been not studied.","Acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) occur very commonly among young adults, and the frequency within this group is significantly higher than that of the general population. [1] Young adults who live in groups (eg, military facilities or dormitories) have a particularly high risk of ARI due to close contact, crowded spaces, and stressful environments. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] It has been shown that young adults with ARIs experience a negative impact on their work; ARIs impede academic performance and attendance among college students [7, 8] and have a substantial impact on military missions, including basic training. In particular, ARIs are responsible for decreased job performance, loss of work-time, and hospitalization, which seriously impact unit readiness. [5, 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] Therefore, decreasing ARI incidence may help improve training accomplishments and trainees' health."
ARTICLE Picornavirus uncoating intermediate captured in atomic detail,"It remains largely mysterious how the genomes of non-enveloped eukaryotic viruses are transferred across a membrane into the host cell. Picornaviruses are simple models for such viruses, and initiate this uncoating process through particle expansion, which reveals channels through which internal capsid proteins and the viral genome presumably exit the particle, although this has not been clearly seen until now. Here we present the atomic structure of an uncoating intermediate for the major human picornavirus pathogen CAV16, which reveals VP1 partly extruded from the capsid, poised to embed in the host membrane. Together with previous low-resolution results, we are able to propose a detailed hypothesis for the ordered egress of the internal proteins, using two distinct sets of channels through the capsid, and suggest a structural link to the condensed RNA within the particle, which may be involved in triggering RNA release.","A lthough we have a convincing picture of how enveloped viruses fuse virus and host cell membranes using a protein machine to allow cell entry 1 , it is much less clear how the fragile genomes of non-enveloped eukaryotic viruses are transferred into the host cell (although more is known of the machinery used by bacterial viruses, for example ref. 2) . Picornaviruses are small icosahedral RNA viruses 3 responsible for many important animal and human diseases, from polio to the common cold, and are well-established models for non-enveloped viruses. It has been found that the mature virus particles can 'breathe', leading transiently to the partial externalization of internal polypeptide 4, 5 , and electron microscopy (EM) studies have visualized expanded capsids thought to correspond to intermediate particles involved in uncoating [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ."

The impact of multiple infections on wild animal hosts: a review Fré dé ric Bordes,"Field parasitological studies consistently demonstrate the reality of polyparasitism in natural systems. However, only recently, studies from ecological and evolutionary fields have emphasised a broad spectrum of potential multiple infections-related impacts. The main goal of our review is to reunify the different approaches on the impacts of polyparasitism, not only from laboratory or human medical studies but also from field or theoretical studies. We put forward that ecological and epidemiological determinants to explain the level of polyparasitism, which regularly affects not only host body condition, survival or reproduction but also host metabolism, genetics or immune investment. Despite inherent limitations of all these studies, multiple infections should be considered more systematically in wildlife to better appreciate the importance of parasite diversity in wildlife, cumulative effects of parasitism on the ecology and evolution of their hosts.","Multiple infections (simultaneous infections with multiple parasite species in an individual host), also called polyparasitism, are the rule, rather than the exception, in the wild. These simultaneous infections are however part of a more broad pattern of parasite assemblages. In fact, if parasites of different species may be encountered in the same host individual (i.e. infracommunities), infections by different and often numerous parasite species are also observed in a host population (called parasite species richness at population level) or in a host species (called parasite species richness at host species level). Moreover, infections with different parasite species are observed at all geographical scales: local (i.e. a village, a forest), regional (i.e. a country, a state) or global scales (i.e. biogeographic realm, continent), generally with parasite species increasing with the geographical scale (5) . Despite being recognised for many years (1, 6) , investigations on the impacts of multiple infections on individual hosts or higher parasite species richness on host populations or species are still scarce in disease ecology and in evolutionary ecology (7, 3) . Our main goals with the present review are to introduce the factors that may explain higher parasite species richness (often investigated as parasite species diversity) in wild animals and to reunify observations and data from various fields (clinical, immunology, ecological parasitology, genetics, theoretical evolutionary epidemiology) to assess the reality of the impacts of multiple infections in natural individual hosts, their potential underlying mechanisms and evolutionary implications (Fig. 1 ). theoretical ecology (with determinants such as latitudinal gradients, geographical range, home range) and epidemiological theory (with determinants such as population size, population density, population longevity). More recently, behavioural ecology has inspired the search of new determinants (sociality, grooming and preening behaviour). Although there is a need for a comprehensive analysis of all published studies, two major determinants seem to emerge consistently from the studies. Host geographical range, an ecologically linked factor, and host population density, an epidemiologically linked factor, appear to be the two most important drivers of parasite species richness, and hence for polyparasitism (Table 1) . A host species living on a large geographical range in high population densities generally harbours a higher diversity of parasite species than a host species living in a more restricted geographical area and in low population densities."

Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2012: 20 Years after the Institute of Medicine Report,"Twenty years ago (1992), a landmark Institute of Medicine report entitled ""Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States"" underscored the important but often underappreciated concept of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). A review of the progress made and setbacks experienced over the past 2 decades suggests that even though many new diseases have emerged, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and the 2009 pandemic influenza, significant advances have occurred in EID control, prevention, and treatment. Among many elements of the increase in the capacity to control EIDs are genomics-associated advances in microbial detection and treatment, improved disease surveillance, and greater awareness of EIDs and the complicated variables that underlie emergence. In looking back over the past 20 years, it is apparent that we are in a time of great change in which both the challenge of EIDs and our responses to them are being transformed. Recent advances support guarded optimism that further breakthroughs lie ahead.","T wenty years ago (1992), a landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) report entitled ""Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States"" underscored the important but often underappreciated concept of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) (1) . Although the IOM report was influential in thrusting the issue of EIDs squarely into scientific and public discourse, the awareness that diseases periodically emerge and reemerge actually goes back millennia (2, 3) . For example, ancient Greek, Roman, and Persian writers documented the emergence of many new epidemics. During and after the 14th-century ""Black Death"" pandemic of bubonic/pneumonic plague, European city officials quarantined arriving ships to prevent its importation and set up quarantine stations to isolate and care for patients. In 1685, the scientist Robert Boyle presciently observed that ""there are ever new forms of epidemic diseases appearing. . . among [them] the emergent variety of exotick and hurtful. . ."" (4, 5) ."
Uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia virus infection,"Feline endometrial adenocarcinomas are uncommon malignant neoplasms that have been poorly characterized to date. In this study, we describe a uterine adenocarcinoma in a Persian cat with feline leukemia virus infection. At the time of presentation, the cat, a female Persian chinchilla, was 2 years old. The cat underwent surgical ovariohystectomy. A cross-section of the uterine wall revealed a thickened uterine horn. The cat tested positive for feline leukemia virus as detected by polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination revealed uterine adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the omentum, resulting in thickening and the formation of inflammatory lesions. Based on the histopathological findings, this case was diagnosed as a uterine adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia virus infection.","Uterine adenocarcinomas have been reported in most domestic species but are considered rare except in rabbits and cows [1] . The prevalence of uterine adenocarcinoma in rabbits after 5 years of age has been reported to be 79% [2] . Because rabbits are induced ovulators that are often housed individually, laboratory rabbit and possibly many pet rabbits are under almost constant estrogen stimulation. Virgin rats have a similar high incidence of endometrial adenocarcinomas [3] . Cats, another species that exhibit induced ovulation, may also be subjected to long periods of unopposed estrogen stimulation, but the frequent practice of neutering queens, and the tendency to periodically breed or induce ovulation in sexually intact queens, may explain the low prevalence of endometrial adenocarcinoma in cats [4] . In women, postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, estrogen in particular, is considered a risk factor for endometrial adenocarcinoma; both estrogen-dependent and higher-grade estrogen-independent adenocarcinomas are recognized [5] ."
Infection and Drug Resistance Dovepress Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus: epidemiology and disease control measures,"The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 2012 resulted in an increased concern of the spread of the infection globally. MERS-CoV infection had previously caused multiple health-care-associated outbreaks and resulted in transmission of the virus within families. Community onset MERS-CoV cases continue to occur. Dromedary camels are currently the most likely animal to be linked to human MERS-CoV cases. Serologic tests showed significant infection in adult camels compared to juvenile camels. The control of MERS-CoV infection relies on prompt identification of cases within health care facilities, with institutions applying appropriate infection control measures. In addition, determining the exact route of transmission from camels to humans would further add to the control measures of MERS-CoV infection.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially identified from a 60-year-old Saudi man who was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah ( Figure 1 ) on June 13, 2012, with history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. 1 He subsequently died 11 days later from progressive respiratory failure. 1 A sputum sample tested negative for common respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus). Inoculation of sputum in LLC-MK2 and Vero cells resulted in viral cytopathic changes. 1 The virus was later identified as a new coronavirus and called Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (HCoV-EMC). 1 A subsequent patient from Qatar, a 49-year-old man, was diagnosed in September 2012 with the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and he was transported to the United Kingdom for intensive care. 2 The isolated viruses from the Saudi and the Qatari cases were 99.5% identical. 2 Subsequently, the virus was designated as MERS-CoV instead of HCoV-EMC according to the Coronavirus Study Group. 3 Retrospective analysis of stored samples from an outbreak in Zarqa, Jordan of a cluster of hospital cases of severe respiratory illness dating back to April 2012 confirmed MERS-CoV as the cause of the outbreak. 4 Since the initial description and as of July 14, 2014, a total of 834 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 288 (34.5%) deaths were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). 5 In this review, we highlight the epidemiology and disease control measures of MERS-CoV. We reviewed the available literature from the beginning of June 2012 to June 2014 utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar."
Clinical findings and treatment of disseminated 'Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis' infection in a domestic cat,"A cat was referred because of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Close examinations revealed a swollen abdominal lymph node and multiple nodules of the liver. Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis infection was confirmed by culture and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of samples recovered from the liver and bronchoalveolar lavage. After administration of combination antibiotics for 6 months, culture results were negative. Though atonic seizures were observed during the treatment, it disappeared after isoniazid discontinuation and pyridoxal phosphate administration.

Focusing on Families and Visitors Reduces Healthcare Associated Respiratory Viral Infections in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,"Introduction: Healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections (HARVIs) result in significant harm to infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. Methods: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. Results: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days. Conclusions: Adding interventions to improve FVHH and visitor management to existing healthcare worker prevention efforts can help reduce","Healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections (HARVIs) are increasingly recognized as important causes of harm in high-risk children, especially neonates and children with underlying immunosuppression, or chronic cardiac or respiratory conditions. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] With the implementation of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests capable of detecting multiple respiratory viruses, viruses such as rhinovirus are frequently identified as the cause of clinical deterioration of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] Studies have shown HARVIs in the NICU result in escalations of care, prolonged respiratory support, and prolonged hospitalizations. 2, 3, 11 Interventions to prevent the transmission of HARVIs such as influenza vaccination, hand hygiene, standard precautions, transmission-based precautions, and environmental cleaning, have focused primarily on the behavior of healthcare workers (HCWs). 1, 12, 13 Family members and visitors play important roles in the care and well-being of hospitalized children, but unfortunately, they occasionally expose the hospitalized child to viruses. In 1 study, about 30% of children with healthcare-associated viral infections were exposed to an ill caregiver or visitor. 1 In efforts to limit transmission of viral infections, most pediatric hospitals enact some form of visitor restrictions or visitor screening in an attempt to limit the presence of symptomatic persons in the hospital. 14 The scope and implementation of these types of interventions are variable."
"Group B Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophid Bats, Japan","We report group B Betacoronavirus infection in little Japanese horseshoe bats in Iwate prefecture. We then used reversetranscription PCR to look for the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene in fecal samples collected from 27 little Japanese horseshoe bats and found eight were provisionally positive. We had a success in the nucleotide sequencing of six of the eight positive samples and compared them with those of authentic coronaviruses. We found that these six samples were positive in coronavirus infection, and they belonged to the group B Betacornavirus by phylogenetic analysis. Virus isolation using the Vero cell culture was unsuccessful. Pathogenic trait of these bat coronaviruses remained unexplored.","Viruses in the genus Betacoronavirus include pathogens that cause emerging pandemic diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), in humans. It has been suggested that bats are major reservoirs for these zoonotic pathogens [9] . This justifies surveillance for coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats throughout the world. In Japan, CoVs belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus have been detected in intestinal and fecal specimens of Eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus fuliginosus) in Wakayama Prefecture [8] . Here, we report the first demonstration of group B betacoronaviruses in little Japanese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus cornutus) in Iwate Prefecture, Japan."
"ISDS 2018 Conference Abstracts A provincial Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance Network (GAFINet), South Korea","The objectives are to introduce a provincial level surveillance system, which has been initiated in response to the MERS-CoV outbreak of South Korea, and describe findings from systematic investigation of individual admissions attributed to acute febrile illness for the first year.","In May 2015, the MERS-CoV outbreaks in South Korea was sparkled from a hospital of Gyeonggi-do province (1) . In response to this outbreak, the provincial government and infectious disease control center (GIDCC) initiated an emergency department (ED) based Gyeonggi-do provincial acute febrile illness (AFI) surveillance network (GAFINet) to monitor for a subsequent outbreak of emerging or imported infectious diseases since September 2016. Gyeonggi-do province is located in the North-West of South Korea, surrounds the capital city Seoul, and borders North Korea ( Figure 1 ). Considering the geographical coverage, GAFINet Initiative involves ten hospitals, consisted of four university-affiliated hospitals and six provincial medical centers in Gyeonggi-do province. These hospitals participated in this network voluntarily, and most staffs including five infectious diseases specialists had direct or indirect experiences in dealing with MERS-CoV patients."
Dominant LMAN2L mutation causes intellectual disability with remitting epilepsy,"Mis-secreted glycoproteins (LGI1, reelin) are emerging causes of epilepsy. LMAN2L belongs to a glycoprotein secretion chaperone family. One recessive LMAN2L missense mutation predicted to impair the chaperone's interaction with glycoproteins was reported in a family with intellectual disability (ID) and remitting epilepsy. We describe four members of a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of a similar phenotype. We show that they segregate a NM_001142292.1:c.1073delT mutation that eliminates LMAN2L's endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and mislocalizes the protein from that compartment to the plasma membrane. LMAN2L mislocalization, like impaired glycoprotein interaction, disturbs brain development, including generation of developmentally restricted epilepsy.","Lectin mannose-binding (LMAN) is a family of three ubiquitously expressed proteins (LMAN1, LMAN2, and LMAN2L), which, anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a C-terminal KRFY sequence interact with glucan chains of select glycoproteins to direct them to extracellular secretion. LMAN1 (ERGIC-53), the best-studied of the group, is so far known to guide five endogenous glycoproteins (Factors V and VIII, Cathepsins C and Z, and a1-antitrypsin) and glycoproteins of five infecting viruses. Complete loss of LMAN1 in humans results in a bleeding disorder and viral resistance, but not a neurological phenotype, indicating that its nervous system function is nonessential. 1 LMAN2 likewise has not been associated with neurological disease. LMAN2L is the least studied of the three; the glycoproteins it processes for secretion are unknown. First evidence that LMAN2L may have a role in brain glycoprotein handling came when genome-wide association studies showed significant association between a polymorphism in LMAN2L and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. 2,3 Subsequently, a recessively inherited variant, p.R53Q, was found to segregate in affected members of a seven-affected multiplex family with nondysmorphic intellectual disability and remitting epilepsy. The causal nature of this variant was further supported by strong in silico evidence, reviewed below.

Penile rehabilitation and cancer spread,"This year, the Editorial Board has given much attention to convergence. By systematically combining diverse fields of study, efforts have been made to overcome the limitations of existing interpretations. The convergent status of rehabilitation exercises and the need to overcome medical and societal problems through convergence, which was emphasized during the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, were introduced. Now, in the last issue of the year, we reconsider the concept of penile rehabilitation, which has until now been recognized as safe. We suggest an urgent need to conduct high-quality prospective studies with regard to the biochemical recurrence of cancer, specifically with regard to the mechanism by which phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) may affect the course of prostate cancer when taken after radical prostatectomy.","cer progression in prospective studies that used PDE5I for the purpose of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy. By using data up to December 2014 from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, a search was performed for prospective case-control studies evaluating the effects of PDE5I intake after radical prostatectomy on erectile dysfunction. From the selected studies, comparisons were made according to the surgical method for prostate cancer, the type and administration method of PDE5I, the method for evaluating erectile functionality, and adverse events (Gallina et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014; Vehmas, 2015) . All 15 randomized prospective studies investigated nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy patients; in 12 studies, the patients underwent bilateral nerve-sparing surgery and in three studies, the patients underwent unilateral nerve sparing. In terms of the type of PDE5I, sildenafil was used in seven studies, tadalafil was used in seven, and vardenafil was used in one. In 11 of the studies, patients were administered PDE5I every day after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, and in four studies patients were only administered PDE5I as needed. Questionnaires used to assess erectile function included the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Sexual Encounter Profile, the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, and the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction. The IIEF was used in all but two studies, either by itself or together with other instruments. Complications after the administration of PDE5I were observed in seven of the 15 studies, and these were mild complications such as headaches, indigestion, hot flashes, and nasopharyngitis. The remaining six studies did not include information on safety and complications of PDE5I intake after surgery. There were no studies that reported follow-up monitoring of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. Studies to date have only focused on the therapeutic effects of PDE5I in restoring erectile functionality, and studies on the effects of PDE5I on prostate cancer are lacking. It is currently not possible to per-form a meta-analysis. Therefore, there is a need for further prospective case-control studies on the association of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer with the intake of PDE5I after radical prostatectomy."
Chimeric camel/human heavy-chain antibodies protect against MERS-CoV infection,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause outbreaks in humans as a result of spillover events from dromedaries. In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV-exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedariesapart from conventional antibodies-have relatively unique, heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional","In 2012, a novel virus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in humans (1) . Six years later, more than 2000 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases, including 36% with a fatal outcome, have been reported globally. Most cases thus far originated from the Arabian Peninsula, as a result of hospital outbreaks (2) . There is convincing evidence that dromedary camels are the primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans. The virus isolated from camels is similar to that isolated from humans and also replicates in human cells (3) . In addition, epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses suggest multiple introductions of MERS-CoV into the human population (2, 4) . This raises a great concern as MERS-CoV could continue to cause outbreaks in the near future. Effective prophylactic and therapeutic intervention strategies are therefore needed to combat this virus."
Management of Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting inflammatory disorder, associated with vasculitis, affecting predominantly medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries. In developed countries KD is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. The aetiology of KD remains unknown, and it is currently believed that one or more as yet unidentified infectious agents induce an intense inflammatory host response in genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes for KD and its sequelae in different ethnic populations, including FCGR2A, CD40, ITPKC, FAM167A-BLK and CASP3, as well as genes influencing response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aneurysm formation such as FCGR3B, and transforming growth factor (TGF) β pathway genes. IVIG and aspirin are effective therapeutically, but recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in severe cases with highest risk of IVIG resistance. Outside of Japan, however, clinical scores to predict IVIG resistance perform suboptimally. Furthermore, the evidence base does not provide clear guidance on which corticosteroid regimen is most effective. Other therapies, including anti-TNFα, could also have a role for IVIG-resistant KD. Irrespective of these caveats, it is clear that therapy that reduces inflammation in acute KD, improves outcome. This paper summarises recent advances in the understanding of KD pathogenesis and therapeutics, and provides an approach for managing KD patients in the UK in the light of these advances.","Kawasaki disease (KD) affects 8.1/100 000 children under the age of 5 years in the UK, and is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. 1-3 KD probably represents an aberrant inflammatory host response to one or more as yet unidentified pathogen(s), occurring in genetically predisposed individuals. 2 4 5 KD is associated with systemic vasculitis particularly affecting the coronary arteries, causing coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in 15-25% of untreated patients while 2-3% of untreated cases die as a result of coronary vasculitis. [6] [7] [8] [9] In view of the frequency and severity of coronary artery complications, there has been intense interest in treatments to reduce the risk of CAA. 6 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] KD is also potentially an important cause of long-term cardiac disease in adult life. 6 7 Notably, as more children with KD are advancing into adulthood, further studies are needed to (1) improve our understanding of longterm cardiac sequelae, (2) optimise therapy in childhood to minimise risks in adulthood and to ensure the continuation of quality, evidence-based care for KD patients as they transit to adult services."
Membrane Insertion of Gap Junction Connexins: Polytopic Channel Forming Membrane Proteins,"Connexins, the proteins that form gap junction channels, are polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins that traverse the plasma membrane bilayer four times. The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation-competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating","that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the cormexins. Variable amounts of similar cormexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression. These results demonstrate that the connexins contain a cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site that can be processed by this enzyme in vitro and in vivo in association with their membrane insertion. Consequently, a specific factor or condition must be required to prevent this aberrant processing of connexins under normal conditions in the cell. C rIANNEL-forming membrane proteins, similar to other plasma membrane (PM) t proteins, are usually synthesized on ribosomes bound to the ER membrane and inserted cotranslationally into this membrane. Subsequently, the proteins are transported to the PM passing through the classical secretory pathway of the cell (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . For translocation into the ER membrane, the proteins need a signal specific for ER membrane targeting that is encoded in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain, either as a cleavable signal sequence on the NH~ terminus and processed by signal peptidase, or as an internal signal anchor sequence (Blobel, 1980; Walter et al., 1984) . After insertion into the ER membrane, the polypeptide domains fold into their final conformation, and they eventually oligomerize most likely with the help of different chaperones, folding enzymes, and metabolic energy (Rothman, 1989; Hendrick and Hartl, 1993) . It can be concluded that connexins follow the secretory pathway based on subcellular connexin distribution studies presented in this paper and from studies reported by other investigators. Studies performed with wild-type connexin-expressing cells isolated from rat liver (this study; Rahman et al., 1993) and dog pancreas (acinar cells, this study), as well as tissue culture cell lines naturally expressing connexins (normal rat kidney fibroblasts [NRK 49F], Musil and Goodenough, 1991) , or transfected with connexin cDNAs (BHK cells; this study) showed connexin proteins in the ER membranes, the Golgi membranes, and in the plasma membranes isolated from these cells."
Antisense-induced ribosomal frameshifting,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating ribosomes into a second open reading frame (ORF). The result is the production of two proteins: the product of standard translation from ORF1 and an ORF1-ORF2 fusion protein. Such programmed frameshifting is commonly utilized as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells and in a subset of cellular genes. RNA secondary structures, consisting of pseudoknots or stem-loops, located downstream of the shift site often act as cis-stimulators of frameshifting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these RNA structures to induce 11 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site, UCC UGA. Antisense-induced shifting of the ribosome into the 11 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells. The efficiency of antisense-induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5 0 of the shift site and to polyamine levels.","The standard triplet readout of the genetic code can be reprogrammed by signals in the mRNA to induce ribosomal frameshifting [reviewed in (1) (2) (3) ]. Generally, the resulting trans-frame protein product is functional and may in some cases be expressed in equal amounts to the product of standard translation. This elaboration of the genetic code (4, 5) demonstrates versatility in decoding."
Deciphering desirable immune responses from disease models with resistant and susceptible chickens,"Coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis (NE) are among the most significant diseases affecting the poultry industry. These diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production. This has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge, and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance. Some chicken breeds and lines show greater resistance or susceptibility to various diseases, and thus these birds maybe able to shed light on immune processes or pathways that contribute to the more resistant/susceptible state. This review attempts to identify potentially important genes that show some consistency in (relative) up or downregulation in key tissues between the resistant and susceptible chickens. For coccidiosis and NE, relative downregulation of IL-10 and (slightly less consistently) upregulation of IFNγ appear to be features of more resistant birds. Data for IFN-α, IL-12, and IL-17D are currently less consistent. Gene expression data from NE studies have identified some potentially interesting, perhaps less well understood, immune-related genes (e.g., TCF12, BCL2, IRF2, TRAF3, TAB3, etc.,) that maybe associated with the resistant and/or susceptible phenotype. Salmonella and Campylobacter are important foodborne pathogens harbored by the chicken intestinal tract, while infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis are also important viral diseases of poultry. We, therefore, consider whether there are consistent features from resistant/susceptible disease models with these pathogens that relate to findings from the coccidiosis and NE studies. It is not anticipated that ideal immune responses to these pathogens will be identical but rather that consistent elements maybe identified that could help inform breeding or alternative strategies to support general disease resistance and enhanced (and efficient) flock productivity.","Coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis (NE) are major intestinal disorders of chickens and were identified as the top two issues affecting broiler production by US poultry veterinarians in a recent survey (Hofacre and Mathis, 2015) . It is estimated that coccidiosis and NE cost the poultry industry around US$ 3 and 6 billion per annum, respectively, through lost productivity, prevention strategies, and/or therapeutic interventions (Wade and Keyburn, 2015) .

The Effect of Having a Regular Doctor as a Primary Care Provider on Emergency Room Utilization in South Korea The Effect of Having a Regular Doctor on Emergency Room Utilization,"Because primary care is the cornerstone of an effective health care system, many developed countries have striven to establish and strengthen their primary care systems. However, the primary care system in South Korea is not well established, and primary care research is still in its infancy. This study aimed to show the benefits of regular doctors as primary care providers in South Korea by analyzing the effect of regular doctor visits on emergency room (ER) visits. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 11,293 adults aged 18 years and over collected from the 2013 Korea Health Panel Survey (beta version 1.0). We classified those participants with and without regular doctors into the treatment and control groups, respectively, and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of having a regular doctor on ER visits. We used counterfactual framework and propensity score analysis to adjust for unevenly distributed confounding covariates between treatments and control groups. Results: The estimated conditional ATE of a regular doctor on ER visits was statistically insignificant in the general population (-0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 1.2) and in the subgroup of patients with hypertension (-1.8%; 95% CI, -4.5 to 0.9). However, in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the estimated ATE was statistically significant (-5.0; 95% CI, -9.2 to -0.7). Conclusion: In the total study population, having a regular doctor did not result in a significant difference in ER visits. However, there was a decrease in ER visits in patients with DM in South Korea.","Because primary care is a cornerstone of effective health care systems, many developed countries have striven to establish and strengthen their primary care systems. However, the primary care system in South Korea is not yet well-established. The Korean health care system is market-oriented and focused on treatment rather than prevention, which encourages further diagnosis and utilization of the large hospital sector. This leads to medically undesirable and unnecessary health care utilization and increased costs. 1) The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in South Korea was also related to the failure of the Korean primary care system. Therefore, strengthening of the primary care is essential for solving many health care problems in South Korea."
Using a Pan-Viral Microarray Assay (Virochip) to Screen Clinical Samples for Viral Pathogens,"The diagnosis of viral causes of many infectious diseases is difficult due to the inherent sequence diversity of viruses as well as the ongoing emergence of novel viral pathogens, such as SARS coronavirus and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, that are not detectable by traditional methods. To address these challenges, we have previously developed and validated a pan-viral microarray platform called the Virochip with the capacity to detect all known viruses as well as novel variants on the basis of conserved sequence homology",". Using the Virochip, we have identified the full spectrum of viruses associated with respiratory infections, including cases of unexplained critical illness in hospitalized patients, with a sensitivity equivalent to or superior to conventional clinical testing [2] [3] [4] [5] . The Virochip has also been used to identify novel viruses, including the SARS coronavirus 6, 7 , a novel rhinovirus clade 5 , XMRV (a retrovirus linked to prostate cancer) 8 , avian bornavirus (the cause of a wasting disease in parrots) 9 , and a novel cardiovirus in children with respiratory and diarrheal illness 10 . The current version of the Virochip has been ported to an Agilent microarray platform and consists of ~36,000 probes derived from over ~1,500 viruses in GenBank as of December of 2009. Here we demonstrate the steps involved in processing a Virochip assay from start to finish (~24 hour turnaround time), including sample nucleic acid extraction, PCR amplification using random primers, fluorescent dye incorporation, and microarray hybridization, scanning, and analysis."
"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nonstructural Proteins 3, 4, and 6 Induce Double-Membrane Vesicles","Coronaviruses (CoV), like other positive-stranded RNA viruses, redirect and rearrange host cell membranes for use as part of the viral genome replication and transcription machinery. Specifically, coronaviruses induce the formation of doublemembrane vesicles in infected cells. Although these double-membrane vesicles have been well characterized, the mechanism behind their formation remains unclear, including which viral proteins are responsible. Here, we use transfection of plasmid constructs encoding full-length versions of the three transmembrane-containing nonstructural proteins (nsps) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to examine the ability of each to induce double-membrane vesicles in tissue culture. nsp3 has membrane disordering and proliferation ability, both in its full-length form and in a C-terminal-truncated form. nsp3 and nsp4 working together have the ability to pair membranes. nsp6 has membrane proliferation ability as well, inducing perinuclear vesicles localized around the microtubule organizing center. Together, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 have the ability to induce double-membrane vesicles that are similar to those observed in SARS coronavirus-infected cells. This activity appears to require the full-length form of nsp3 for action, as double-membrane vesicles were not seen in cells coexpressing the C-terminal truncation nsp3 with nsp4 and nsp6.","threatening disease of unknown origin in late 2002 in the Guangdong Province of southern China.

Multiple laboratory groups ultimately identified the causative agent as a novel coronavirus: the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Although there have not been any epidemic outbreaks of the SARS-CoV since the initial incident, the recent emergence of a related deadly human coronavirus, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highlights the importance of continued research into this group of human pathogens (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) ."

Urinary YKL-40 as a Candidate Biomarker for Febrile Urinary Tract Infection in Young Children,"Background: Given that YKL-40 is a known marker of inflammation, we sought to determine its association with urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile children.","YKL-40, also referred to as cartilage glycoprotein-39 or chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1), is a member of the mammalian chitinase-like protein family; its abbreviation is derived from the oneletter code for the first three N-terminal amino acids, tyrosine (Y), lysine (K), and leucine (L), and its molecular weight (40 kDa) [1] [2] [3] . YKL-40 is expressed in a variety of cells, including some primary immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and some cancer cells [3] . Although the exact roles of YKL-40 remain unclear, it has been implicated in diverse biological processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation [4] . Elevated levels of YKL-40 have been observed in patients with acute or chronic inflammatory diseases such as cancers, and in those with cardiovascular, infectious, and autoimmune diseases [5] . In particular, a few previous studies have suggested that YKL-40 might be a site-specific inflammatory marker given that it is locally produced at the sites of inflammation [6] [7] [8] [9] ."
"Veterinary Science pISSN 1229-845X, eISSN 1976-555X","Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infection and controlling the spread of IBV, but currently available inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines have some disadvantages.

Open Forum Infectious Diseases Comparison of Rates of Hospitalization Between Single and Dual Virus Detection in a Mexican Cohort of Children and Adults With Influenza-Like Illness,Background. Molecular detection methods allow for the simultaneous detection of several infectious agents. This study assesses whether co-infection with 2 viruses as compared with 1 is associated with increased hospitalization in those with acute respiratory infections.,"Current estimates indicate that lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the fifth leading cause of death in the world, accounting for 2.74 million deaths in 2015 [1] . The etiology of acute respiratory infections is diverse, and respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as important causes of severe respiratory infections. Before the introduction of molecular detection methods, the etiology of a large proportion of acute respiratory infections could not be ascertained. The increasing use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other molecular methods has allowed for detection of respiratory viruses in a large proportion of cases. In addition, during the last 2 decades, previously unrecognized agents, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), rhinovirus C, and several coronaviruses, have been identified as new causes of respiratory infection [2] [3] [4] [5] . As such, the use of currently available diagnostic techniques allows detection of at least 1 pathogen in the majority of patients [6] . Additionally, the rates of hospitalization are significantly different based on the virus isolated.

Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector vaccines for WHO blueprint priority pathogens,"The devastating Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa in 2013-2016 has flagged the need for the timely development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens. To be better prepared for new epidemics, the WHO has compiled a list of priority pathogens that are likely to cause future outbreaks and for which R&D efforts are, therefore, paramount (R&D Blueprint: https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/). To this end, the detailed characterization of vaccine platforms is needed. The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been established as a robust vaccine vector backbone for infectious diseases for well over a decade. The recent clinical trials testing the vaccine candidate VSV-EBOV against EBOV disease now have added a substantial amount of clinical data and suggest VSV to be an ideal vaccine vector candidate for outbreak pathogens. In this review, we discuss insights gained from the clinical VSV-EBOV vaccine trials as well as from animal studies investigating vaccine candidates for Blueprint pathogens.","Emerging infectious diseases are a major threat to public health. Ebola virus (EBOV) and other high-threat pathogens have recently been declared one of the top ten health threats of 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 Out of the five Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) that WHO has declared to date, four have been caused by emerging or re-emerging viruses. The last few years, humanity experienced novel and increasingly frequent outbreaks for which timely and efficient countermeasures were lacking. Between 2013 and 2016, more than 11,000 people lost their lives to the dramatic West African Ebola virus disease epidemic. In 2015, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) demonstrated to the world how rapidly a virus can spread into new regions due to travel, when a 68-year-old Korean man returning from the Middle East was infected by MERS-CoV and became the index case for a chain of secondary mainly nosocomial transmissions cumulating in 138 MERS-CoV infections, including 36 deaths. 2 The 2016 Zika virus outbreak in the Americas and its resulting cluster of associated neurological disorders and neonatal malformations, 3 also was declared a PHEIC, to name just a few recent outbreaks that emphasize the urgency to create strategies to contain future outbreaks fast and effectively. In the future, socioeconomic factors including an increased global human population and lifespan, urbanization, intensified global travel and mobility and the effects of climate change will further ripen conditions for the emergence and rapid spread of viruses between and among populations. Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent and control this viral spread; however, few vaccine candidates for emerging infections exist. As a result of this phenomenon of supply vacuum, novel viral outbreaks such as the EBOV crisis found the global medical community ill-prepared, and the deployment of a preventive vaccine was delayed due to the lack of clinical-stage vaccine candidates."
Survey of Clinical Laboratory Practices for 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak in the Republic of Korea,Background: It is crucial to understand the current status of clinical laboratory practices for the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in the Republic of Korea to be well prepared for future emerging infectious diseases.,"On May 20, 2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was confirmed for the first time in an infected patient in the Republic of Korea. Although the primary case traveled to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the patient did not initially report his recent travel in those countries [1] . This case led to transmission of MERS-CoV both within a hospital and between hospitals and eventually resulted in the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV infections outside the Arabian Peninsula."
,"Objectives: Complement activation product C5a plays a critical role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by viruses, bacteria, and toxic agents including paraquat poisoning. This study is to explore the efficiency of anti-C5a-based intervention on systemic inflammatory responses induced by paraquat poisoning. Design: Study of cynomolgus macaque model and plasma from paraquat-poisoning patients. Setting: Laboratory investigation.","T he complement system is a pivotal component of innate immune system and bridge of the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, once dysregulated, it can turn against host cells and is involved in numerous diseases and pathologic conditions such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases (1) . Complement activation products such as C5a play an important role in mediating proinflammatory activity and regulating modulatory signals (2) (3) (4) . Thus, regulation of complement activation is a promising treatment strategy (5, 6) .

The New Age of Virus Discovery: Genomic Analysis of a Novel Human Betacoronavirus Isolated from a Fatal Case of Pneumonia,"A new human betacoronavirus in lineage c, tentatively called HCoV-EMC, was isolated from a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who died from acute severe pneumonia and renal failure. The viral RNA has been detected in eight additional cases. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the viral genomic RNA showed that it is a novel virus not previously detected in any other species and that its closest relatives are two Asian bat coronaviruses. HCoV-EMC may represent a sporadic spillover to humans from an unknown animal reservoir. In a recent article, van Boheemen et al. demonstrated how state-of-theart sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis can quickly provide critical insight into the viral genome sequence, phylogeny, replication strategy, and potential drug and vaccine targets and generate tools to evaluate the possible epidemic risk associated with this novel human virus.","D uring the past decade, at least 9 novel human respiratory viral pathogens have been discovered, primarily by using highly sensitive nucleotide sequencing and new virus detection technologies. These human viruses include human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses in clade C, bocavirus, polyomaviruses WU and KI 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, and 3 new human coronaviruses (HCoV). Until 2003, only two coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, were known to cause human disease, primarily upper respiratory tract infections. The discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) as the cause of the SARS pandemic of 2002 to 2003 demonstrated the epidemic potential of this large family of RNA viruses and emphasized their importance in human respiratory diseases. After the SARS pandemic, two additional human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1, were identified and found to cause both upper and lower respiratory tract disease. Although these coronaviruses were only recently discovered, they have probably been circulating in the human population worldwide for a long time. HCoV-OC43 apparently jumped from a bovine host into humans more than 100 years ago and has become endemic worldwide. In contrast, the SARS pandemic was caused by a novel human virus that had very recently emerged into the human population from its zoonotic reservoirs, Chinese horseshoe bats (suborder Microchiroptera, family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) (1, 2) . Indeed, extensive phylogenetic studies suggest that all alpha-and beta coronaviruses may be derived from bat coronaviruses (3)."
"Open Forum Infectious Diseases A Decade On: Systematic Review of ClinicalTrials.gov Infectious Disease Trials, 2007-2017",Background. Registration of interventional trials of Food and Drug Administration-regulated drug and biological products and devices became a legal requirement in 2007; the vast majority of these trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov offers an opportunity to define the clinical research landscape; here we analyze 10 years of infectious disease (ID) clinical trial research.,"The appropriate management of infectious diseases (IDs) requires an understanding of the risk and efficacy of medical drugs, biologics, and devices. In this context of evidence-based medicine, clinical trials contribute knowledge to replace or confirm prior dogma. As discussed elsewhere, ID specialists often contend with a lack of clinical trials (and particularly randomized controlled trials) to inform clinical decision making [1, 2] ."
Clinical and laboratory profiles of hospitalized children with acute respiratory virus infection,"Purpose: Despite the availability of molecular methods, identification of the causative virus in children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has proven difficult as the same viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children. Methods: Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. Viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. Results: Of 3,505 patients, viruses were identified in 2,424 (69.1%), with the assay revealing a single virus in 1,747 cases (49.8%). While major pathogens in single virus-positive cases differed according to age, human rhinovirus (hRV) was common in patients of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IF), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found to be seasonal pathogens, appearing from fall through winter and spring, whereas hRV and adenovirus (AdV) were detected in every season. Patients with ARIs caused by RSV and hRV were frequently afebrile and more commonly had wheezing compared with patients with other viral ARIs. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was observed in ARIs caused by IF, AdV, and hRV, whereas lymphocyte-dominant inflammation was observed with RSV A, parainfluenza virus, and hMPV. Monocytosis was common with RSV and AdV, whereas eosinophilia was observed with hRV. Conclusion: In combination with viral identification, recognition of virus-specific clinical and laboratory patterns will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral ARIs and help us to establish more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a main cause of morbidity and mortality in children, with viruses being responsible for more than 80% of ARIs worldwide. 1, 2) Clinical manifestations of ARI can hardly differentiate bacterial from viral etiologies, which can lead to the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Recent development of the multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay makes noninvasive identification of respiratory pathogens possible. However, a more accurate diagnosis of causative ARI pathogens does not decrease hospital admissions or antibiotic use in children with ARI. 3) Since viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children, 4) identification of a virus by RT-PCR does not always imply that it is the culprit for a current ARI. Because these viruses are sometimes asymptomatic carriers and sometimes pathogens, a diagnosis should not be based solely on viral identification in respiratory samples. Moreover, new respiratory viruses have been increasingly recognized, but their clinical significance remains unclear. 5, 6) Thus, in addition to multiplex RT-PCR assays, Korean J Pediatr 2018;61 (6) :180-186 a better understanding of these viruses is required to improve clinical management."
"Pharmacological targets in the ubiquitin system offer new ways of treating cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and infectious diseases","Recent advances in the development and discovery of pharmacological interventions within the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) have uncovered an enormous potential for possible novel treatments of neurodegenerative disease, cancer, immunological disorder and microbial infection. Interference with proteasome activity, although initially considered unlikely to be exploitable clinically, has already proved to be very effective against haematological malignancies, and more specific derivatives that target subsets of proteasomes are emerging. Recent small-molecule screens have revealed inhibitors against ubiquitin-conjugating and -deconjugating enzymes, many of which have been evaluated for their potential use as therapeutics, either as single agents or in synergy with other drugs. Here, we discuss recent advances in the characterisation of novel UPS modulators (in particular, inhibitors of ubiquitin-conjugating and -deconjugating enzymes) and how they pave the way towards new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of proteotoxic disease, cancer and microbial infection.","The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) controls the turnover and biological function of most proteins within the cell, and alterations in this process can contribute to cancer progression, neurodegenerative disorders and pathogenicity associated with microbes. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of the UPS can potentially provide chemotherapeutics for the treatment of tumours, neurodegenerative conditions and infectious diseases. The widespread involvement of components of the UPS in many biological processes is reflected by the fact that several hundred genes have now been associated with this pathway (Refs 1, 2). Ubiquitin is a protein with 76 amino acids that can be covalently attached to other proteins, thereby influencing their fate and function. Protein ubiquitylation has numerous physiological functions. It can act as a recognition signal for proteasomal degradation (polyubiquitylation), serve as a signalling scaffold for protein-protein interactions (Lys63poly-or monoubiquitylation) or represent a targeting signal for the lysosomal pathway or other cellular compartments (mostly monoubiquitylation). The ability of the ubiquitylation machinery to selectively target substrates is mediated by the specificity of ubiquitin ligation (E2 and E3 enzymes) and deconjugation, promoted by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). Interference with either arm of this pathway should allow highly targeted pharmacological intervention, provided that compounds with sufficient selectivity can be identified ( Refs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) (Fig. 1 ). Additional opportunities are provided by the discovery of pathogen-encoded factors that evolved to target the UPS of the host cell, representing attractive targets for treatments against infectious diseases (Refs 10, 11, 12) . Therefore, the UPS offers a source of novel pharmacological targets as the basis for the successful development of drugs to treat human diseases. However, the complexity of the ubiquitin system causes considerable challenges for high-throughput drug discovery because of extensive structural similarities. The generation of selective inhibitors is also impeded by the large number of DUBs ( Refs 13, 14) , ubiquitinconjugating enzymes (E2s) and ubiquitin ligases (E3s) (Ref. 15 ) that might have redundancies in their biological functions. All these enzymes possess affinity for ubiquitin and various ubiquitin conjugates. Therefore, their specificity is dependent on other structural subtleties and differences in protein-protein interactions unique to each enzyme species. To address this problem, an array of methodologies is used, such as the identification of 'hits' by highthroughput screening (HTS), the development of suitable assays for functional screening in vitro and in cells, and the use of protein structures to aid rational drug design. These approaches have already resulted in the discovery of a panel of inhibitory compounds against the proteasome, several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and DUBs, all of which have potential for further specific drug development, as discussed here."
Multitask learning for host-pathogen protein interactions,"Motivation: An important aspect of infectious disease research involves understanding the differences and commonalities in the infection mechanisms underlying various diseases. Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of hostpathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called 'multitask learning', which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A 'task' in our scenario is the set of host-pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host-pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a taskbased regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex-Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host-pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.","Infectious diseases are a major health concern worldwide, causing millions of illnesses and deaths each year. Newly emerging viral diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella and Escherichia coli outbreaks not only lead to wide-spread loss of life and health, but also result in heavy economic losses. To better navigate this landscape of infectious diseases, it is important to not only understand the mechanisms of individual diseases, but also the commonalities between them. Combining knowledge from related diseases will give us deeper insights into infection and host immune response, will enhance our ability to comprehend new diseases and lead to efficient development of therapeutics."
"INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and Financing",Health professionals' knowledge and awareness of the disease surveillance is essential for reporting diseases to health departments. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of Jordanian physicians toward public health surveillance of communicable disease. A cross-sectional study was conducted among resident doctors who were working in 4 main Ministry of Health hospitals and 2 teaching hospitals in Jordan in September 2017. A self-administered paper-based questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire collected information about sociodemographic and practicerelated characteristics of physicians and included items to assess their knowledge of surveillance and reporting practices. This study included 223 physicians (152 males and 71 females). About 60.1% of the residents were graduates from medical schools in Jordan and the remaining (39.9%) were graduates from medical schools in other countries. Approximately two thirds of residents (62.3%) were doing their residency in Ministry of Health hospitals and the rest (37.7%) in 2 teaching hospitals. Only 44.8% of physicians had defined surveillance correctly. Only 27.4% of physicians had been educated or trained on surveillance. About 39.5% of physicians had filled at least one report form during their practice. The main reasons for not reporting mandatory diseases were high workload (49.8%) and being not trained on reporting diseases (46.6%). A relatively high percentage of physicians have insufficient knowledge of surveillance and reporting of notifiable communicable diseases. Training of physicians on surveillance and diseases notification is highly needed. The practice of disease notification should be enforced in Jordanian hospitals.,"Communicable disease control is a public health priority to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. 1 The increase of emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), cholera, and ebola has attracted the attention to the importance of communicable diseases reporting and surveillance systems. 2, 3 Epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases through the mandatory-reporting system is INQUIRY crucial in the planning and evaluation of disease prevention and control programs, monitoring the health of the public, identifying public health problems, and triggering action to prevent further illness. 4 Disease surveillance depends on the definition of case and recognition of illness, compilation of individual data, analysis, and reporting."
SURVEY AND SUMMARY Insights into the development of chemical probes for RNA,"Over the past decade, the RNA revolution has revealed thousands of non-coding RNAs that are essential for cellular regulation and are misregulated in disease. While the development of methods and tools to study these RNAs has been challenging, the power and promise of small molecule chemical probes is increasingly recognized. To harness existing knowledge, we compiled a list of 116 ligands with reported activity against RNA targets in biological systems (R-BIND). In this survey, we examine the RNA targets, design and discovery strategies, and chemical probe characterization techniques of these ligands. We discuss the applicability of current tools to identify and evaluate RNA-targeted chemical probes, suggest criteria to assess the quality of RNA chemical probes and targets, and propose areas where new tools are particularly needed. We anticipate that this knowledge will expedite the discovery of RNA-targeted ligands and the next phase of the RNA revolution.","The field of RNA biology has exploded in recent years with the discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that regulate essential processes in all living organisms (1) . These processes include transcription, translation, and evasion in bacteria and archaea (1, 2) as well as replication, persistence, and cellular transformation in viruses (3) . Within the human genome, protein-coding genes are vastly outnumbered by regulatory ncRNAs that can influence a wide range of cellular functions (2, 4) . Many of these ncRNAs are dysregulated in and implicated as drivers of various human diseases, including metastatic cancers and neurologi-cal and neuromuscular disorders (2, 5, 6) . This 'RNA revolution' is radically changing our understanding of the role RNA plays in fundamental biology and is rapidly driving scientific innovation."
Original Article,"Calf diarrhea caused by infectious agents is associated with economic losses in the cattle industry. The purpose of this study was to identify the causative agents and epidemiological characteristics of diarrhea in Korean native calves (KNC). In total, 207 diarrheal KNC aged less than 7 months were investigated. Fecal samples collected from the rectum were examined for causative agents using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR and the number of oocysts were counted. Fourteen causative agents were detected from 164 of the 207 diarrheal KNC. Rotavirus was the most common agent (34.8%), followed by Eimeria spp. (31.7%), Escherichia coli (22.0%), Giardia spp. (14.0%), Clostridium difficile (9.8%), bovine viral diarrhea virus (8.5%), coronavirus (7.9%), Cryptosporidium spp. (7.3%), torovirus (6.7%), parvovirus (5.5%), norovirus (4.9%), kobuvirus (1.8%), adenovirus (1.2%), and Salmonella spp. (0.6%). About 95 (57.9%) of 164 calves were infected with a single causative agent and 42.1% were infected by multiple agents. No significant difference was observed in mortality between calves infected with a single agent and multiple agents. The occurrence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Eimeria spp., kobuvirus, and Giardia spp. was significantly different based on onset age, and the prevalence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus or C. difficile was significantly different between seasons. This study help the understanding of KNC diarrhea for the development of an effective strategy for disease prevention and control, especially in Eastern provinces of South Korea.","Calf diarrhea caused by infectious agents is associated with enormous economic losses in the cattle industry, owing to calf death, growth retardation, and treatment costs [1] . Calf diarrhea is related to diverse and complex factors such as individual health conditions, management practice, rearing environment, as well as infectious causative agents. More than 50% of mortality in preweaned calves has been related to diarrhea, and most cases have occurred in calves less than 1 month of age [2] ."
Biological cryo-electron microscopy in China,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) plays an increasingly more important role in structural biology. With the construction of an arm of the Chinese National Protein Science Facility at Tsinghua University, biological cryo-EM has entered a phase of rapid development in China. This article briefly reviews the history of biological cryo-EM in China, describes its current status, comments on its impact on the various biological research fields, and presents future outlook.","In 1950, Professor Ling-Chao Tsien ( ) was ushered into a warehouse of the former Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) government Broadcasting Company in Nanjing, where he unpacked a cargo container full of unassembled parts of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). These TEM parts, manufactured by the British company Metropolitan-Vickers, were purchased and hastily left behind by the fleeing Kuomintang government on its way to Taiwan. Professor Tsien was so excited about the serendipitous finding that he immediately decided to assemble the microscope despite lack of an installation handbook. In no more than 4 years, he and his co-workers published the first electron microscopy (EM) research article in China, 1 in which they described the fine structural defects of aluminum foil. This article marked the beginning of an era in China that relied on EM to examine the world at nanoscale. Application of EM soon became popular in China, especially due to its powerful utility in the characterization of inorganic materials for the steel and engineering industry."
Consultation-liaison psychiatry in China,"Consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) was first established in China after liberation in 1949. It has developed more rapidly over the last two decades but, despite major regional differences in the level of CLP, the overall practice of CLP in the country remains quite basic, largely limited to case-based consultation with other medical departments. There is little ongoing collaboration between departments of psychiatry and other departments, and medical students and nonpsychiatric clinicians rarely get training in CLP.","According to Lipowski, [1] the article published by George Henry in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1929 marked the launch of consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) as a scientific discipline. Initially, the CLP doctor was scoffed at as 'a pleasant, pipe-smoking gentleman wearing a tweed jacket who, with much time on his hands, proselytized for the psychosocial model'. [2] Such stereotypes have changed over time. Today, CLP physicians are expected to have the multidisciplinary knowledge and skills needed to carry out psychiatric interviews; to conduct risk assessments and manage threats of suicide, assault, and agitation in common clinical settings; to interpret laboratory results; and to consider the physical, legal, and ethical issues when managing the psychiatric problems of patients with concurrent physical illnesses. They are also required to possess good communication skills when interacting with non-psychiatrists, other health care professionals, and patients' family members. [2] The specialty of CLP was initially launched in the United States and subsequently adopted worldwide, but its development in China has not been a smooth one. Prior to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, psychiatric units had been established in some general hospitals in China, but there are no reports of CLP-type services. After 1949, the departments of psychiatry and clinical psychology established in many general hospitals started to provide CLP services, particularly in university teaching hospitals. In parallel with the rapid economic and social reforms that started in China in the 1980s, the concept of CLP has become more widely accepted by medical professionals and administrators; this has facilitated increased cooperation between departments of psychiatry and other clinical departments. This article briefly introduces the development of CLP in China and its current status."
"Stimulation of reverse transcriptase generated cDNAs with specific indels by template RNA structure: retrotransposon, dNTP balance, RT-reagent usage","RNA dependent DNA-polymerases, reverse transcriptases, are key enzymes for retroviruses and retroelements. Their fidelity, including indel generation, is significant for their use as reagents including for deep sequencing. Here, we report that certain RNA template structures and G-rich sequences, ahead of diverse reverse transcriptases can be strong stimulators for slippage at slippageprone template motif sequence 3 of such 'slippagestimulatory' structures. Where slippage is stimulated, the resulting products have one or more additional base(s) compared to the corresponding template motif. Such structures also inhibit slippagemediated base omission which can be more frequent in the absence of a relevant stem-loop. Slippage directionality, base insertion and omission, is sensitive to the relative concentration ratio of dNTPs specified by the RNA template slippage-prone sequence and its 5 adjacent base. The retrotransposon-derived enzyme TGIRT exhibits more slippage in vitro than the retroviral enzymes tested including that from HIV. Structure-mediated slippage may be exhibited by other polymerases and enrich gene expression. A cassette from Drosophila retrotransposon Dme1 chrX 2630566, a candidate for utilizing slippage for its GagPol synthesis, exhibits strong slippage in vitro. Given the widespread occurrence and importance of retrotransposons, systematic studies to reveal the extent of their functional utilization of RT slippage are merited.","Non-standard events during the elongation phase of transcription can either enrich gene expression or contribute to erroneous and wasteful expression. An example of the former is selection for reverse transcriptase-mediated multiple alternative base substitutions to lead to pathogen surface variability to evade host defenses (1) . A different type of productive non-standard polymerase action involves realignment of the template:product hybrid at a slippage-prone sequence to yield product with extra or fewer base(s) than present in the corresponding template sequence (2) . This has been studied with DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases, RTs)."
,"In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible-or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.","In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were identified in Wuhan, China. 1 The results of genome sequencing, released on 10 January 2020, showed that the pneumonia outbreak was related to a new coronavirus, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), whose genetic sequence is homologous to that of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 2 Coronaviruses are enveloped with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and with a nucleocapsid. 3 Although the 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus, it has characteristics common to other coronaviruses, such as sensitivity to heat (it can be inactivated after 30 minutes at 56 • C), diethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, and chloroform. 4 Further genetic and amino acid sequencing of the S-protein of 2019-nCoV established that the receptorbinding domain of the S-protein binds to recipient cells and interacts strongly with human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor molecules. 2 This finding shows that the underlying pathogenesis of the virus is to infect the human respiratory epithelium through the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway. The sequencing from isolated 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020, 5 and the genomic sequence substantially facilitated the development of real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect the virus."
Toll-Like Receptor 3 Signaling via TRIF Contributes to a Protective Innate Immune Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sensors that recognize molecular patterns from viruses, bacteria, and fungi to initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens. The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a concern for global public health, as there is a lack of efficacious vaccine platforms and antiviral therapeutic strategies. Previously, it was shown that MyD88, an adaptor protein necessary for signaling by multiple TLRs, is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that TLR3 ؊/؊ , TLR4 ؊/؊ , and TRAM ؊/؊ mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection.","ruses, have observed that bats harbor myriad novel and potentially emergent coronaviruses with unknown pathogenic potential, indicating that coronavirus spillover into human and livestock populations may continue (6) . Despite the importance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as public health threats, there are currently no available antivirals against these pathogens, with current evidence suggesting that the antiviral drugs ribavirin and interferon (IFN) are not efficacious in ameliorating SARS or MERS infections (7) (8) (9) . While research on MERS-CoV is still in the nascent stages, efforts to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV have been hindered by the challenges of vaccine-induced immune pathology as well as the likely need for cross-protection against highly variable and antigenically distinct coronaviruses with unknown emergence and pathogenic potential (10) (11) (12) ."
NOTE Preventing the spread of norovirus-like infections by the airborne route using plasma assisted catalytic technology (PACT),"Zoonoses are frequently reported, and outbreaks of the highly pathogenic influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome have occurred recently, in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Sterilization using a chemical reactor with plasma assisted catalytic technology (PACT) was investigated. Tests were carried out on the feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccine strain F9, which is a surrogate of airborne pathogen human norovirus. Results showed that the PACT device could inactivate FCV, which passed through the plasma chamber. Sterilization rate may be more than 99.99% (below the detection limit). These results indicate that PACT may be an effective mean to inactivate many viruses, including human norovirus, and potentially other airborne, infectious microorganisms.","Airborne infectious diseases, such as SARS, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and highly pathogenic avian influenza, are serious threats to human health. Infected individuals may visit health care institutions, increasing the chance of infection for both patients and health care workers, in particular, the infection of immunocompromised persons, leading to serious illness and possible death [16] . Infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and varicella virus are spread through coughing and sneezing by infected individuals. Scattered droplets dry and form dried droplet nuclei alone or by adhering to particles in the air and infection occurs by inhalation. When droplet nuclei are less than 5 µm in diameter they can float in the air for a prolonged time and become widely spread [1, 16] . Airborne infection is partially dependent on the concentration of infectious pathogen in the air [8] . Vaporized material from infected person's vomit may also result in airborne infection. A typical pathogen transmitted by airborne infection is norovirus. Cases of infection from an air conditioner 1-2 days after processing vomit from norovirus infected persons have been reported [3, 7, 15] ."

These include use of viral vectors, cationic liposomes, and polymers. several copolymers were designed and synthesized based on blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) PeG, poly(propylene glycol) PPG, and poly(l-lysine). These were designated as P1, P2, and P3. We studied the copolymer self-assembly, siRNa binding, particle size, surface potential, architecture of the complexes, and siRNa delivery. silencing of GFP using copolymer P3 to deliver GFP-specific siRNa to Neuro-2a cells expressing GFP was almost as effective as using Lipofectamine 2000, with minimal cytotoxicity. Thus, we have provided a new copolymer platform for siRNa delivery that we can continue to modify for improved delivery of siRNa in vitro and eventually in vivo. Figure 9 . Gene silencing of GFP protein in Neuro 2a/GFP cells at a final concentration of 80 nM siRNa. cells were treated with complexes of copolymer P1, P2, and P3 with GFP siRNa at N/P ratio of 6, 12, and 24. cells were also treated with naked siRNa or Lipofectamine-complexed siRNas as additional controls.","RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is an exciting, new technology with many potential biomedical applications. siRNAs are generated by cleavage of long, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) by the cytoplasmic enzyme Dicer in plants and worms, 1 but can also be synthetically produced and introduced into mammalian cells to achieve gene silencing. 1, 2 Inside the cells, siRNA targets specific mRNA (mRNA) for enzymatic degradation via association with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Exploiting this system, siRNAs have been designed as promising therapies to target human diseases including those caused by viruses [3] [4] [5] [6] and cancers. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] A major challenge of using therapeutic siRNAs in vivo is effective and safe delivery. Typically, siRNAs are 7 nm in length with an approximate molecular weight of 13 KDa 1 and have a high net negative charge. Thus, size and charge make siRNAs unable to readily penetrate cellular membranes. Furthermore, naked siR-NAs are quickly degraded by nucleases in the bloodstream, and have a short half-life of minutes in the plasma. 12 Therefore, different methods have been proposed and examined to protect and deliver siRNAs with varying degrees of success. These include use of viral vectors, cationic liposomes, and polymers."
Intensive Care Unit Relocation and Its Effect on Multidrug-Resistant Respiratory Microorganisms,"Background: Infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens leads to poor patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs). Contact precautions are necessary to reduce the transmission of MDR pathogens. However, the importance of the surrounding environment is not well known. We studied the effects of ICU relocation on MDR respiratory pathogen detection rates and patient outcomes. Methods: Patients admitted to the ICU before and after the relocation were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, types of respiratory pathogens detected, antibiotics used, and patient outcomes were measured. Results: A total of 463 adult patients admitted to the ICU, 4 months before and after the relocation, were included. Of them, 234 were admitted to the ICU before the relocation and 229 afterward. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, and underlying comorbidities, did not differ between the two groups. After the relocation, the incidence rate of MDR respiratory pathogen detection decreased from 90.0 to 68.8 cases per 1,000 patient-days, but that difference was statistically insignificant. The use of colistin was significantly reduced from 53.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3 to 86.7 days) to 18.7 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 31.7 days). Furthermore, the duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced from a median of 29 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14 to 50 days) to 21 days (IQR, 11 to 39 days). Conclusions: Incidence rates of MDR respiratory pathogen detection were not significantly different before and after ICU relocation. However, ICU relocation could be helpful in reducing the use of antibiotics against MDR pathogens and improving patient outcomes.","Given the extensive use of antibiotics in intensive care units (ICUs) [1] , nosocomial infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens in an ICU have become a major problem. In a previous prospective surveillance study of 10 Asian countries, resistance to imipenem was observed in 67.3% of Acinetobacter isolates and 27.2% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with MDR rates of 82% and 42.8% among patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively [2] . The mortality rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are higher than those of community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia [3] . Furthermore, MDR pathogens can increase the mortality rates of ICU-acquired pneumonia [4] . Therefore, controlling the pre valence of MDR pathogens in the ICU is mandatory for patient safety."

,"Determination of the UspA1 crystal structure Crystals of UspA1 were grown by vapour diffusion from 12 % PEG 3350 and 0.2 M ammonium phosphate, to which 25 % glycerol was added before cooling to 100K. Diffraction data were collected on beamline BM14 (λ= 0.95350 Å) at ESRF Grenoble, France, and at the Daresbury SRS. Data were integrated and scaled in HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and manipulated with the CCP4 suite of crystallographic software (1994). The structure was solved by a novel exploratory molecular replacement method using in excess of 20 different coiled-coil structures as search models in the program PHASER (McCoy et al., 2005) . The coordinates of a single strand of the coiled coil of cortexellin (1D7M.pdb), which has no recognisable sequence identity to UspA1 , was eventually successful despite being from a dimeric coiled coil. Solutions from PHASER had Z scores of 6 and 13 after rotation and translation respectively to find the first molecule in the asymmetric unit, and 5 and 9 for the second molecule.","Initial phases were improved by mutation of the sequence to poly-Ala followed by ""atoms update and refinement"" mode of ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 2001) .

"Plasma citrulline, arginine, nitric oxide, and blood ammonia levels in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea","Background: Plasma citrulline (CIT) concentration is considered to be a reliable marker of functional enterocyte mass, primarily in humans. However, information about CIT levels along with related metabolites, arginine (ARG), nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia in neonatal calves are lacking.","primarily in the small bowel include diarrhea, dehydration, malnutrition, potentially systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, and even death. 1, 4, 5 Citrulline (CIT), a nonprotein amino acid, is involved in arginine (ARG) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and the urea cycle. 6, 7 Synthesized from glutamine primarily in the small intestine, CIT is released from enterocytes into blood. 8, 9 For this reason, since the early 2000s, plasma CIT concentration has been used as a biomarker for enterocyte mass and absorptive function in various intestinal diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and sepsis 16, 17 in humans, independent of nutritional and inflammatory status. 18 Therefore, it could be useful to predict the health and function of the intestine in calves.

Risk Management and Healthcare Policy Dovepress Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic,"The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.","The magnitude of the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has been unprecedented in many ways. This is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa although EVD outbreaks in Africa have been documented since 1976. This outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent. 1 It has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak, and standards for prevention and care. These debates have also focused national and international attention on disparities in health care standards between developed and developing countries, on differing applications of ethical standards governing the right to health between developed and developing countries arising from these disparities, and the ethical responsibilities of various agencies in the current and future infectious disease outbreaks."
Single-dose treatment with a humanized neutralizing antibody affords full protection of a human transgenic mouse model from lethal Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus infection HHS Public Access,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is continuously spreading and causing severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans. Prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed to control MERS-CoV infection. Here, we generated a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated hMS-1, which targeted the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) with high affinity. hMS-1 significantly blocked MERS-CoV RBD binding to its viral receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), potently neutralized infection by a prototype MERS-CoV, and effectively cross-neutralized evolved MERS-CoV isolates through recognizing highly conserved RBD epitopes. Notably, single-dose treatment with hMS-1 completely protected hDPP4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice from lethal infection with MERS-CoV. Taken together, our data suggest that hMS-1 might be developed as an effective immunotherapeutic agent to treat patients infected with MERS-CoV, particularly in emergent cases.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first isolated from a Saudi Arabian patient in September 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012) , causes human infection in other parts of the world and thus has become a global concern. In particular, an outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 infections with 36 deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-july-2015mers-korea/en/). As of March 16, 2016, a total of 1,690 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 600 deaths have been reported (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/ en/), representing a mortality rate of 36%. The symptoms caused by MERS-CoV are similar to those from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a related coronavirus with a 10% fatality rate that led to the 2002-2003 epidemic (Skowronski et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2003) . Unlike SARS-CoV, for which no additional cases have been reported since 2005 (Du et al., 2009 ), MERS-CoV has shown continually increasing numbers of cases, particularly in Saudi Arabia, suggesting its potential future epidemic status. Nevertheless, no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics are currently available, highlighting the urgent need of potent strategies to combat this virus."
Laboratory epidemiology of respiratory viruses in a large children's hospital A STROBE-compliant article,Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common causes of outpatient visit and hospital admission for children. The study aimed to report epidemiological data on respiratory viruses in a university-affiliated children's hospital.,"Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common causes of outpatient visit and hospital admission for children. [1] The severity of the ARTI varies substantially depending on the site of infection, the type of viruses, involved organs and comorbidities. [2] For example, viral pneumonia can be life threatening due to uncontrolled systematic inflammatory response, leading to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. [3] [4] [5] These later conditions require intensive care unit admission, and are associated with significantly increased risk of death, high medical cost and family distress. [4] It was estimated that there were approximately 1.9 million children died annually from ARTI, and most of them were from developing countries. [6] The type of respiratory viruses is very important for the understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of respiratory infections in children. A recent epidemiological study involving 17 centers and 8 countries showed that rhinovirus/enterovirus (41.5%) is the most prevalent viruses causing children's respiratory infection, followed by influenza (15.8%), adenovirus (9.8%), parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (both 9.7%). [7] China is a country with the largest population in the world. With the implementation of 2-child policy, the children's hospitals in China are facing great challenge to treat increasing number of children. ARTI is the most common reason for outpatient visit and hospital admission in China, [8] imposing a great challenge for clinicians. Throat swab and sputum samples are usually ordered for children with suspected ARTI and the number is very large. [9, 10] However, there is no study reporting epidemiological data on test results of respiratory viruses. The study aimed to report epidemiological data on respiratory viruses in a university-affiliated children's hospital. Furthermore, we investigated distributions of different types of respiratory viruses with seasonal changes. Risk factors for positive results for adenovirus, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also investigated."
"Characterization of the structure, cells, and cellular mechanobiological response of human plantar fascia","In this study, we report that human plantar fascia consists of two distinct tissues with differential structural properties. These tissues also contain stem/progenitor cells with differential biological properties. The mechanobiological responses of these two plantar fascia stem cells also differ in terms of expression of collagen I and IV, non-ligament-related genes, and proinflammatory genes. The production of inflammatory agents (prostaglandin E 2 , interleukin-6) and matrix degradative enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2) are also different between the two types of plantar fascia stem cells. Based on the findings from this study, we suggest that plantar fasciitis results from the aberrant mechanobiological responses of the stem cells from plantar fascia sheath and core tissues. Our findings may also be used to devise tissue engineering approaches to treat plantar fascia injury effectively.","Plantar fascia (PF) is a flat band of ligament-like tissue that connects one's heel bone to toes. This tissue helps to sustain body weight and is subject to large mechanical loads during daily activities. For example, during walking and running, PF could be subjected to mechanical loads that are in several folds to the body weight. [1] [2] [3] [4] Plantar fasciitis, or PF inflammation, is one of the most common causes of heel pain that affects more than 3 million people in the United States alone every year. 5 It accounts for 11% to 15% of the foot symptoms requiring professional care among adults. [6] [7] [8] [9] Despite the high prevalence of plantar fasciitis, no effective treatment is currently available in clinics10 because its pathogenesis is largely unknown. 10 Mechanical overload is considered to be a major factor causing plantar fasciitis presumably due to repetitive microtrauma; other factors, such as anatomical irregularity of the foot and environmental conditions (e.g., activities and footwear), also contribute to the pathology. [11] [12] [13] Although a repair process is initiated, continued microtrauma to the junctional site between PF and heel bone causes chronic inflammation of the fascia. 14, 15 Histological findings indicate that chronic plantar fasciitis also involves degenerative changes in PF tissue, as evidenced by the presence of mucoid substance and bone marrow vascular ectasia. 10 Disorganized and degenerating collagen fibers, angiofibroblastic hyperplasia, and calcification are the major histopathological findings in plantar fasciitis. 16 In recent years, the importance of adult stem cells in tissue regeneration and degeneration has been noted. [17] [18] [19] [20] Adult mesenchymal stem cells have remarkable abilities to proliferate extensively in an uncommitted state (selfrenewal) and differentiate into various cell lineages (multidifferentiation potential), such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. 21 In tendons, such adult stem cells called tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSCs) have been isolated and characterized in humans, mice, rats, and rabbits. [22] [23] [24] Similarly, adult stem cells from human anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) and medial collateral ligaments (MCL) have also been identified. 21 We have shown that mechanical overloading leads to tendon inflammation by inducing over-expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) and increased production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), a known inflammatory mediator. 25, 26 Moreover, mechanical overloading may cause aberrant differentiation of TSCs into non-tenocytes, which may lead to tendon degeneration manifested as lipid accumulation, mucoid formation, and tissue calcification. 27 Therefore, like tendons, PF may contain stem cells, which may also play a vital role in the development of plantar fasciitis. However, while PF has been extensively studied biomechanically, little has been done at the structural and cellular levels. 28 In this study, we aimed to characterize the biological properties and mechanobiological responses of stem cells isolated from human PF tissues. We identified two distinct types of tissues in human PF, namely, sheath and core, which are structurally dissimilar in terms of collagen organization, collagen types, and presence of blood vessels. In addition, these two tissue types contain distinct stem cells that exhibit differential biological properties such as clonogenicity, multi-differentiation and proliferation potential, and expression of stem cell markers (octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4), stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4), and nucleostemin (NS)). The mechanobiological response of these two populations of PF stem cells also differs in terms of expression of collagen I and IV, non-ligament-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), Runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx-2), collagen II), inflammatory genes (cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)), as well as the production of inflammatory agents (PGE 2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and matrix degradative enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2))."
"State of the Art Diagnosis, Monitoring, and Treatment of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: PCD Foundation Consensus Recommendations Based on State of the Art Review","Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, rare lung disease resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease in both children and adults. Many physicians incorrectly diagnose PCD or eliminate PCD from their differential diagnosis due to inexperience with diagnostic testing methods. Thus far, all therapies used for PCD are unproven through large clinical trials. This review article outlines consensus recommendations from PCD physicians in North America who have been engaged in a PCD centered research consortium for the last 10 years. These recommendations have been adopted by the governing board of the PCD Foundation to provide guidance for PCD clinical centers for diagnostic testing, monitoring, and appropriate short and long-term therapeutics in PCD patients. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:115-132. ß ","Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, rare lung disease causing chronic otosino-pulmonary disease and irreversible lung damage that may progress to respiratory failure. [1] [2] [3] Recently, significant progress has been made in PCD diagnosis, 4 yet few physicians outside of highly experienced PCD centers are skilled in recognizing the characteristic clinical phenotype and interpreting diagnostic tests. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Patients often receive false-positive or false-negative PCD diagnoses, as physicians are unaware of the pitfalls commonly encountered with ciliary electron microscopy, 10, 11 PCD molecular genetic panels, 12, 13 ciliary motility studies, [14] [15] [16] and nasal nitric oxide testing. 17, 18 Furthermore, PCD is often missed when respiratory symptoms are present in patients with other complex diseases involving cilia, such as heterotaxy and various genetic syndromes. [19] [20] [21] [22] From a therapeutic perspective, there are no prospective, randomized clinical trials on monitoring or treating PCD. Thus, physicians treating PCD adapt therapeutic approaches used for other chronic respiratory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis. Differences in various phenotypic parameters among PCD, CF, and non-CF bronchiectasis suggest that extrapolating therapies may not be appropriate for PCD management in some circumstances. [23] [24] [25] [26] Because of the uncertainty surrounding diagnosis and management of PCD, physicians from the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) created this consensus statement to guide new North American PCD clinical centers endorsed by the PCD Foundation. The GDMCC includes clinicians at nine academic centers in North America that have systematically evaluated over 1,000 patients suspected of having PCD and performed longitudinal studies of pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD. The GDMCC also works closely with the PCD Foundation on research and clinical PCD projects. This consensus statement is evidence based where possible, and addresses key clinical PCD issues, but it is not the product of GRADE recommendations. 27 Through telephone conferences, email communications, and in person meetings, eight pediatric pulmonologists, two adult pulmonologists, and two otolaryngologists from North America undertook to: (1) describe the PCD clinical phenotype, (2) establish standard PCD diagnostic recommendations, (3) recommend PCD clinical care and long-term monitoring schedules, and (4) outline clinical therapies used to manage PCD. After a literature review (using Pubmed and Embase), drafts were created and circulated iteratively to participating physicians with discussion of feedback and suggestions over sequential telephone conferences and electronic communications. Participating GDMCC physicians and the PCD Foundation governing board unanimously approved this consensus statement."
Role of RNA helicases in HIV-1 replication,"Viruses are replication competent genomes which are relatively gene-poor. Even the largest viruses (i.e. Herpesviruses) encode only slightly .200 open reading frames (ORFs). However, because viruses replicate obligatorily inside cells, and considering that evolution may be driven by a principle of economy of scale, it is reasonable to surmise that many viruses have evolved the ability to co-opt cell-encoded proteins to provide needed surrogate functions. An in silico survey of viral sequence databases reveals that most positive-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses have ORFs for RNA helicases. On the other hand, the genomes of retroviruses are devoid of virally-encoded helicase. Here, we review in brief the notion that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has adopted the ability to use one or more cellular RNA helicases for its replicative life cycle.","Helicases are enzymes that separate in an energy-dependent manner stretches of duplexed DNA and/or RNA into singlestranded components. Currently, based on characteristic motifs and the sequence comparisons, three superfamilies (SF1 through 3) and two smaller families (F4, F5) of helicases have been identified (1) . Superfamily 1 and 2 contain helicases which share seven or more recognized signature amino acid motifs while SF3 and F4 and F5 helicases are characterized generally by three conserved motifs (2) ; the F4 and F5 proteins are largely bacterial and bacteriophage proteins. Currently, it should be cautioned that many 'helicases' are not bona fide helicases, but may only function as RNA translocases, perhaps to fulfill functions in the remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP)."
Determining Immune System Suppression versus CNS Protection for Pharmacological Interventions in Autoimmune Demyelination,"A major hallmark of the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is immune cell infiltration into the brain and spinal cord resulting in myelin destruction, which not only slows conduction of nerve impulses, but causes axonal injury resulting in motor and cognitive decline. Current treatments for MS focus on attenuating immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). These treatments decrease the number of relapses, improving quality of life, but do not completely eliminate relapses so long-term disability is not improved. Therefore, therapeutic agents that protect the CNS are warranted. In both animal models as well as human patients with MS, T cell entry into the CNS is generally considered the initiating inflammatory event. In order to assess if a drug protects the CNS, any potential effects on immune cell infiltration or proliferation in the periphery must be ruled out. This protocol describes how to determine whether CNS protection observed after drug intervention is a consequence of attenuating CNS-infiltrating immune cells or blocking death of CNS cells during inflammatory insults. The ability to examine MS treatments that are protective to the CNS during inflammatory insults is highly critical for the advancement of therapeutic strategies since current treatments reduce, but do not completely eliminate, relapses (i.e., immune cell infiltration), leaving the CNS vulnerable to degeneration.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by inflammatory lesions predominantly in white matter regions of the brain early in disease. After longterm progression, gray matter atrophy is detected by MRI imaging and marks the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. Reactive gliosis, demyelination, and axonal damage in the white matter are attributed to CNS-infiltrating immune cells. None of the treatments currently used in MS reverse or directly prevent neurodegeneration in the CNS -instead, they reduce inflammation by attenuating T cell activation and/or infiltration into the CNS. Because there is no cure for MS and patients using current treatments continue to experience disease progression, discoveries of drugs that prevent demyelination and neuronal loss are critically important. However, differentiating between effects on immune cells and those on the CNS can be difficult experimentally, as the outcome -i.e., reduced damage to the CNS -looks the same regardless of the mechanisms through which it occurs. Therefore, assessment of CNS protection must be partnered with assessments of CNS-infiltrating immune cells and proliferation of immune cells in the periphery to determine how pharmacological agents affect disease mechanisms."
,"The possible occurrence of a highly pathogenic influenza strain is of concern to health authorities worldwide. It is believed that developing countries may experience a higher illness attack rate compared to developed countries. Intervention strategies shown by modelling studies to be highly effective for developed countries give limited guidance as to the impact which an influenza pandemic may have on low-income countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG), given different demographics and resource constraints. To address this, an individual-based model of a PNG community was created, used to simulate the spread of a novel influenza strain and the results compared to those obtained from a comparable Australian model.",This modelling study investigated the impact of an influenza pandemic on a community in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and compared it with that in a similar sized community in Australia. The effectiveness of social distancing interventions was determined using the PNG model and contrasted with the Australian model.

Media impact switching surface during an infectious disease outbreak,"There are many challenges to quantifying and evaluating the media impact on the control of emerging infectious diseases. We modeled such media impacts using a piecewise smooth function depending on both the case number and its rate of change. The proposed model was then converted into a switching system, with the switching surface determined by a functional relationship between susceptible populations and different subgroups of infectives. By parameterizing the proposed model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the Shaanxi province of China, we observed that media impact switched off almost as the epidemic peaked. Our analysis implies that media coverage significantly delayed the epidemic's peak and decreased the severity of the outbreak. Moreover, media impacts are not always effective in lowering the disease transmission during the entire outbreak, but switch on and off in a highly nonlinear fashion with the greatest effect during the early stage of the outbreak. The finding draws the attention to the important role of informing the public about 'the rate of change of case numbers' rather than 'the absolute number of cases' to alter behavioral changes, through a self-adaptive media impact switching on and off, for better control of disease transmission. E merging infectious diseases such as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 1,2 and the 2009 novel influenza A(H1N1) pandemic 3,4 have significant societal impacts not only through diseaseinduced morbidity and mortality, but also through their interference with socio-economic activities and population movement. Global public health systems of surveillance and response have been substantially improved in order to curb an emerging disease by containing it at source 5-7 or by slowing down its spread from the source 8,9 . Effective public health information processing is at the core of any global surveillance and response system. This is because at the start of an emerging epidemic, massive news coverage and fast information flow can generate profound psychological impacts on the public, and hence greatly alter individuals' behaviour and influence the implementation of public intervention and control policies 10 . How long and how effective media impact remains is therefore an issue of great importance for future epidemics control, and quantifying this impact through a mathematical modeling framework falls within the scope of this study.","treatment. We stratify the usual susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) compartments in the classical SIR model 15 , to include the quarantined susceptible (S q ) and isolated infected (I q ) compartments. With contact tracing, a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined. The quarantined individuals can either move to compartment I q or S q , depending on whether they are infected or not 16, 17 , while the remaining proportion, 1 2 q, of individuals exposed to the virus, but missed from the contact tracing, move to the infectious compartment I (once infected) or stay in compartment S (if uninfected). Let the media-influenced transmission probability be b and the contact rate be a constant c. Then the quarantined individuals, if infected (or uninfected), move to the compartment I q (or S q ) at a rate of bcq (or (1 2 b)cq). Those who are not quarantined, if infected, will move to the compartment I at a rate of bc(1 2 q). The infected individuals can be detected and then isolated at a rate of d I , and can also move to the compartment R due to recovery. The transmission dynamics is illustrated in Fig. 1 ."
Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Dovepress Parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide among medical college students in Japan,"Background: Suicide is a grave public health issue that is responsible for a high mortality rate among individuals aged 15-44 years. Attitudes toward suicide among medical staff members have been associated with appropriate therapeutic responses to suicidal individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of parental rearing on attitudes toward suicide among Japanese medical college students. Methods: We examined the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide in 160 medical college students in Japan. The Parental Bonding Instrument was used to assess the attitudes and behaviors of parents. The attitudes toward suicide were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Attitudes Toward Suicide questionnaire. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 25.2±4.0 years old. The majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide (88.8%) and that suicide is preventable (86.3%). After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis revealed that maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the ""right to suicide"" attitude. Under the same conditions, maternal care was shown to be significantly associated with the ""common occurrence"" attitude. No other significant relationships were observed between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide.","Suicide is a grave public health issue with a global mortality rate of 16 per 100,000 individuals. 1 Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death, particularly among individuals aged 15-44 years, which is a productive age group. 1 Suicide is a complex event that is influenced by biological, cultural, psychological, and socioeconomic factors."
Comparative Functional Analysis of 12 Mammalian IFN-l4 Orthologs,"IFN-l4 is a novel type-III interferon with strong clinical significance in humans. Only a subset of individuals-up to 10% of Asians, 50% of Europeans, and 90% of Africans-carry the DG allele of a genetic variant rs368234815-TT/DG and are genetically able to produce IFN-l4 protein. Carriers of the DG allele have impaired ability to clear infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). IFN-l4 is also predicted to exist and be functionally important in several nonhuman mammals. In this study, we present the first comparative analysis of 12 mammalian IFN-l4 orthologs in a human hepatic cell line, HepG2, which supports signaling of the human IFN-l4. We show that despite differences in protein sequences, functional properties of the recombinant human and nonhuman IFN-l4 proteins are comparable-they are all expressed as predominantly cytoplasmic proteins that are biologically active for induction of interferon signaling. We show that several IFN-l4 orthologs can be detected by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal imaging using a monoclonal antibody developed for the human IFN-l4. Studies of IFN-l4 in animals should help improve our understanding of the biology of this novel clinically important interferon in normal and disease conditions.","I nterferons (IFNs) are an essential part of the innate immune response, which is the first line of defense against pathogens. The induction of IFNs leads to activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and expression of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) in the infected and the surrounding cells. This response can limit viral spread through mobilization of cellular defense mechanisms and elimination of infected cells (Parkin and Cohen 2001; Levy and others 2011) ."
The Reemergent 1977 H1N1 Strain and the Gain-of-Function Debate,"The 1977-1978 influenza epidemic was probably not a natural event, as the genetic sequence of the virus was nearly identical to the sequences of decades-old strains. While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF) influenza virus research, as an argument for why this research should not be performed. There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed. Given the importance of this historical epidemic to ongoing policy debates, we revisit the evidence that the 1977 epidemic was not natural and examine three potential origins: a laboratory accident, a live-vaccine trial escape, or deliberate release as a biological weapon. Based on available evidence, the 1977 strain was indeed too closely matched to decades-old strains to likely be a natural occurrence. While the origin of the outbreak cannot be conclusively determined without additional evidence, there are very plausible alternatives to the laboratory accident hypothesis, diminishing the relevance of the 1977 experience to the modern GOF debate.","I n 1977, an H1N1 influenza virus appeared and circled the globe."
RNA structure interactions and ribonucleoprotein processes of the influenza A virus,"In one more years, we will 'celebrate' an exact centenary of the Spanish flu pandemic. With the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, the possibility of novel pandemic remains ever a concern. This review covers our current knowledge of the influenza A virus: on the role of RNA in translation, replication, what is known of the expressed proteins and the protein products generated from alternative splicing, and on the role of base pairing in RNA structure. We highlight the main events associated with viral entry into the cell, the transcription and replication process, an export of the viral genetic material from the nucleus and the final release of the virus. We discuss the observed potential roles of RNA secondary structure (the RNA base-pairing arrangement) and RNA/RNA interactions in this scheme.","The influenza virus belongs to the class known as Orthomyxoviruses [1, 2] and can be divided into three distinct subtypes (influenza A, influenza B or influenza C), depending on its nucleoproteins (NPs) and the antigen determinants of its matrix proteins. The influenza virus is a negative-sense, singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that is segmented into eight (Subtypes A, B) or seven (Subtype C) separate strands. Each segment codes for at least one protein, and based on the extensive studies of the influenza A virus (IAV) in recent years, it seems likely that all subtypes express at least twice as many proteins as its number of segments [3] ."
Pathogen-host-environment interplay and disease emergence,"Gaining insight in likely disease emergence scenarios is critical to preventing such events from happening. Recent focus has been on emerging zoonoses and on identifying common patterns and drivers of emerging diseases. However, no overarching framework exists to integrate knowledge on all emerging infectious disease events. Here, we propose such a conceptual framework based on changes in the interplay of pathogens, hosts and environment that lead to the formation of novel disease patterns and pathogen genetic adjustment. We categorize infectious disease emergence events into three groups: (i) pathogens showing up in a novel host, ranging from spill-over, including zoonoses, to complete species jumps; (ii) mutant pathogens displaying novel traits in the same host, including an increase in virulence, antimicrobial resistance and host immune escape; and (iii) disease complexes emerging in a new geographic area, either through range expansion or through long distance jumps. Each of these categories is characterized by a typical set of drivers of emergence, matching pathogen trait profiles, disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Our framework may assist in disentangling and structuring the rapidly growing amount of available information on infectious diseases. Moreover, it may contribute to a better understanding of how human action changes disease landscapes globally.","An emerging infectious disease (EID) can be defined as 'an infectious disease whose incidence is increasing following its first introduction into a new host population or whose incidence is increasing in an existing host population as a result of long-term changes in its underlying epidemiology'. 1 EID events may also be caused by a pathogen expanding into an area in which it has not previously been reported, or which has significantly changed its pathological or clinical presentation. 2 Mostly, infectious disease emergence in humans is caused by pathogens of animal origin, so-called zoonoses. [2] [3] [4] [5] Likewise, cross-over events may occur between non-human species including between domestic animals and wildlife, and such events also involve transmission from a reservoir population into a novel host population (spillover). [5] [6] [7] Emergence in a novel host, which includes spill-over/ zoonoses, has been extensively studied. An elaborate framework featuring the subsequent stages in the emergence process of a species jump has already been developed, describing how an established animal pathogen, through stages of spill-over and lengthening of the transmission chain in the novel host, may evolve all the way up to an established and genetically consolidated pathogenic agent. [8] [9] [10] However, as implied by the above broader definition of EID, other categories can be distinguished in addition to emergence in a novel host, including disease outbreaks in an existing host or the emergence of a disease complex beyond the normal geographic range."
Understanding of the functional role(s) of the Activating Transcription Factor 4(ATF4) in HIV regulation and production The activating transcription factor (ATF) 4 belongs to the ATF/CREB (cAMP Response Element Binding bZIP [Basic,"The induction of ATF4 expression has previously been shown to increase the replication of HIV-1. However, the detailed mechanism underlying this effect and the factors involved in the regulation of ATF4 function are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate first that knocking out ATF4 using siRNA shows a strong negative effect on HIV-1 production, indicating that ATF4 is a functional positive cellular factor in HIV-1 production. To determine the mechanism by which ATF4 regulates the HIV-1 life cycle, we assessed the effect of the overexpression of wild type ATF4 and its various derivatives on HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcriptional activation and the production of HIV-1 particles. This effect was studied through co-transfection experiments with either reporter vectors or proviral DNA. We found that the N-terminal domains of ATF4 are involved in HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcriptional activation, and thus in HIV-1 production. [BMB Reports 2018; 51(8): 388-393] BMB Rep. 2018; 51(8): 388-393 www.bmbreports.org","The activating transcription factor (ATF) 4, which is composed of 351 amino acids, is a member of the ATF/CREB (cAMP Response Element Binding) protein family. It could function interestingly as either a transcriptional activator or a repressor (1, 2) . It is also known to act as a protective factor that mediates the adaptation of cells to stressors such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nutrient deprivation (3) . These stressors induce ATF4 expression, resulting in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which in turn increases the translation of ATF4 but reduces global protein synthesis (1, 4, 5) . ATF4 is capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers (6) . The N-Terminus of ATF4, which is called the p300 interaction site, functions as a transcriptional activation domain and is implicated in protein stability as well (7) (8) (9) . A basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain is located in the C-Terminus of ATF4 and is known to interact with DNA (6, 10) . The leucine zipper of the bZIP domain contains alpha helices with leucine residues that mediate dimerization with a parallel leucine zipper domain (11) . ATF4 can be localized to the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal sequence KKLKK (amino acids 280 to 284) in the basic region (12) . The expression of ATF4 could be stimulated or blocked by viral infection, causing either an increase or decrease in viral production (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Infection with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activates the UPR pathway, and the HCMV proteins activate ATF4 expression (13, 14) . The transcriptional activity and thus the production of the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) are known to be mediated by the binding of ATF4 to DNA and the subsequent activation of transcription (15) . Dengue virus (DENV) can also increase the expression of ATF4 in the nucleus (16) . The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which is a coronavirus, induces ATF4 expression at early stages of infection (17) . It is also known that ATF4 expression is induced by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), resulting in the upregulation of HHV-8 production (18) . On the other hand, several studies have shown that the expression of ATF4 could be blocked by certain types of viruses, such as myxoma virus (MXMV) (19) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (20) , and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (21) ."
Clinical Interventions in Aging Dovepress The aging lung,"There are many age-associated changes in the respiratory and pulmonary immune system. These changes include decreases in the volume of the thoracic cavity, reduced lung volumes, and alterations in the muscles that aid respiration. Muscle function on a cellular level in the aging population is less efficient. The elderly population has less pulmonary reserve, and cough strength is decreased in the elderly population due to anatomic changes and muscle atrophy. Clearance of particles from the lung through the mucociliary elevator is decreased and associated with ciliary dysfunction. Many complex changes in immunity with aging contribute to increased susceptibility to infections including a less robust immune response from both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Considering all of these age-related changes to the lungs, pulmonary disease has significant consequences for the aging population. Chronic lower respiratory tract disease is the third leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older. With a large and growing aging population, it is critical to understand how the body changes with age and how this impacts the entire respiratory system. Understanding the aging process in the lung is necessary in order to provide optimal care to our aging population. This review focuses on the nonpathologic aging process in the lung, including structural changes, changes in muscle function, and pulmonary immunologic function, with special consideration of obstructive lung disease in the elderly.","Pulmonary disease has significant consequences for the aging population. Chronic lower respiratory tract disease, defined as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is the third leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older. 1 According to 2010 census data, 13% of the US population, or 40.3 million people, are older than age 65, which is higher than any previous census. Additionally, the population is aging at an increasingly faster rate each year. Between 2000 and 2010, the population age 65 years and over increased by 15 .1% compared to the total US population which only increased by 9.7%. 2 With such a large and rapidly growing aging population it is critical to understand how the body changes with age and how this impacts the entire respiratory system.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Current Therapeutic Options and Potential Targets for Novel Therapies HHS Public Access,"No specific antivirals are currently available for two emerging infectious diseases, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A literature search covering pathogenesis, clinical features and therapeutics, clinically developed drugs for repurposing and novel drug targets was performed. This review presents current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical features of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The rationale for and outcomes with treatments used for SARS and MERS is discussed. The main focus of the review is on drug development and the potential that drugs approved for other indications provide for repurposing. The drugs we discuss belong to a wide range of different drug classes, such as cancer therapeutics, antipsychotics, and antimalarials. In addition to their activity against MERS and SARS coronaviruses, many of these approved drugs have broad-spectrum potential and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections. A wealth of knowledge is available for these drugs. However, the information in this review is not meant to guide clinical decisions, and any therapeutic described here should only be used in context of a clinical trial.

In a retrospective analysis, a cohort of 20 patients was treated with oral ribavirin and SC pegylated IFN-α2a at a dose of 180 μg/week for 2 weeks (Table 2) [30]. The initial dose of ribavirin was 2000 mg, followed by a 200-1200 mg dose depending on creatinine clearance. A group of 24 patients that received supportive care and corticosteroids were considered the control group. At 14 days after confirmed diagnosis of MERS, survival was increased in the treated group (70%) compared to the control group (29%). By 28 days postdiagnosis, 30% of treated subjects survived versus 17% of the control group [30] . In an additional case study, a 69-year-old Greek patient who contracted MERS in Jeddah was treated with oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily), pegylated IFN (180 μg SC once per week for 12 weeks), and ribavirin (2000 mg initial dose; 1200 mg every 8 h for 8 days, initiated on day 13 post-diagnosis). Two days after treatment initiation viremia could not be detected; however, viral RNA was detected in several patient samples (feces, respiratory secretions, and serum) up to 14 weeks post-diagnosis. Despite prolonged survival, the patient succumbed from septic shock 2 months post-diagnosis [31] . An ongoing randomized clinical trial in Saudi Arabia is evaluating treatment of MERS patients with IFN-β1b in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir [32]."

The current study investigated the health conditions, and the extent and pattern of cattle injuries, along with haematobiochemical and hormonal changes, before and after long-distance transportation (≈648 km) from the market of origin to the market of destination. A total of 100 adult cattle were selected at the Benapole live cattle market, Bangladesh, for physical examination before and after transportation. Fifty of these cattle were randomly selected for additional haemato-biochemical evaluation just before the start of transportation (0 hour), immediately after arrival at the destination market (13.8±0.9 hours after the start of transportation) and 24 hours after arrival at the destination market. The external health conditions and injuries were assessed. Animals were fasting in the vehicle during transportation and provided only with paddy straw and water before sale at the destination market. Before and after transportation, the overall frequency of cattle injuries varied significantly (26 per cent before v 47 per cent after transportation; P<0.001). Cattle health conditions diverged significantly (such as nasal discharge: 15 per cent v 28 per cent; P=0.03).

Cytomegalovirus pneumonia as the first manifestation of severe combined immunodeficiency,"in one case, whereas Pneumocystis jiroveci was identified as a co-pathogen in one cMV-infected patient. Severe combined immunodeficiency is a pediatric emergency condition and given the significant impact of pulmonary CMV infection in SCID children, establishing an accurate etiological diagnosis is of essential importance in instituting the specific treatment and improving the outcome.","Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of inherited, genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by a defective T lymphocyte development, leading to their absence or dysfunction that affects both cellular and humoral arms of adaptive immunity. Depending on the genetic defect influencing the presence or absence of B lymph cells and NK cells, SCID may be conventionally categorized as T-B+ and T-B-SCID, the first being caused by mutations in cytokine-mediated signaling and defective V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining) recombination necessary for the rearrangement of the B and T cell receptor genes in the latter [1] . A defective T-cell mediated immune response and the subsequent inability to clear viral infections makes SCID infants susceptible to inflammatory lung damage due to infections with paramyxoviruses and adenoviruses, with high rates of respiratory failure and mortality [2] . Progressive interstitial pneumonitis with hyper-inflation reflecting the impairment of peripheral ventilation are common features of an infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci, as a co-pathogen with respiratory viruses [1, 3] ."
Nanomedicine for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome What Is It about?,"Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a heterogenous group of lung disease in critically ill patients that continues to have high mortality. Despite the increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ARDS, specific targeted treatments for ARDS have yet to be developed. ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies. Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients. Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to","Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) still represent an unmet medical need because of the high morbidity and mortality with substantial medical expenditure [1] [2] [3] . Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches to treat ARDS. Unfortunately, contemporary drug development approaches to address this challenge have not been rewarding -in particular blockade of single cytokines and chemokines have failed to show an improvement in outcomes because of the complex pathogenesis and nature of the disease [4] . Therefore, defining the contribution of proximal signaling pathways that amplify the inflammatory response and developing targeted therapies to specifically block them is an attractive approach to limit injury and inflammation for this devastating disease [5] . To this end, we have identified several targets that modulate signaling pathways that amplify inflammation and hence are attractive to be tested as potential therapies for ALI and ARDS. However, delivery of peptides, proteins, and silencing RNAs to the lung is an ongoing challenge [6] [7] [8] ."
Harnessing the immune system's arsenal: producing human monoclonal antibodies for therapeutics and investigating immune responses,"Monoclonal antibody technology has undergone rapid and innovative reinvention over the last 30 years. Application of these technologies to human samples revealed valuable therapeutic and experimental insights. These technologies, each with their own benefits and flaws, have proven indispensable for immunological research and in our fight to provide new treatments and improved vaccines for infectious disease.","Studying the molecular arms race that characterizes our constant fight against pathogens has revealed a powerful source of therapeutics using an obvious and widely available resource: our own immune response. In particular, it is the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)-highly specific, continuously generating antibodies derived from a single B cell clone that target only a single site (epitope) on a single antigenthat offers a lot of this potential. These are exciting times in monoclonal antibody research. The steady stream of technological advances is, if anything, accelerating in the 21 st century, knocking down obstacles in the process. New applications are wide ranging-from finding the Achilles heel of pathogens and elucidating autoimmune disease, to treating infections in patients. The latest round of developments allows us to hope that they may be used in the clinic to kill cancer cells and eradicate pathogens such as influenza."
Use of Dipstick Assay and Rapid PCR-DNA Analysis of Nasal Secretions for Diagnosis of Bacterial Sinusitis in Children With Chronic Cough,"Background: Chronic cough in children is a diagnostic challenge. Objective: To discover the utility of nasal dipsticks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA analysis in differentiating bacterial sinusitis from other causes of chronic cough and identifying pathogens from the nasal cavity. Method: We recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3). Based on symptoms, the results of nasal secretion assays, and nasal endoscopy, a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. We identified potential pathogens by quantitative PCR of nasal secretions. Results: Group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis n ¼ 10): Eight (80%) patients had bacterial sinusitis associated with dominant potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB): Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group 1B (cough without clinical bacterial sinusitis n ¼ 12): None had dominant PPB. Group 2 (allergic rhinitis n ¼ 7): None had dominant PPB. Group 3 (asymptomatic n ¼ 10): None had dominant PPB. Twenty to 57% of all groups were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty to 70% were colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum. Conclusion: In children with chronic cough, clinicians can utilize a simple and inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay for rapid diagnosis of sinusitis and identify PPB by DNA-PCR test for specific antibiotic treatment.","Chronic cough is defined as daily cough lasting 4 weeks or longer. 1 In children under 15 years of age, the causes of chronic cough include congenital defects, asthma, foreign body aspiration, infections, allergic diseases, gastroesophageal reflux, tumors, and other rare causes. 2 Among these, the most common etiologies include asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and nonspecific cough. 3, 4 The diagnosis of asthma or cough variant asthma can be made on the basis of NAEPP EPR-3 criteria and response to a bronchodilator. 5 Upper airway cough syndrome is a common entity, 3, 4 most likely triggered by postnasal drip due to either allergic and nonallergic rhinitis or bacterial and nonbacterial sinusitis. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is now recognized as one of the most common causes of chronic wet cough, especially in young children under 5 years of age. 6, 7 Once asthma and other conditions listed above are ruled out, upper airway cough syndrome or protracted bacterial bronchitis need to be considered as the most likely diagnoses. In approaching these clinical entities, our goal was to promptly detect the patients with bacterial sinusitis and the involved pathogens and to treat them with appropriate antibiotics. To this end, we decided to employ a novel method described by Huang and Small, 8 who reported that nasal secretion dipstick assay was highly correlated with sinus imaging studies and could be utilized for the diagnosis of sinusitis. We employed this simple approach for obvious reasons: speed, cost-effectiveness, and avoidance of radiation risk associated with sinus imaging studies. We also sought an equally simple and rapid method for identification of the pathogens for the suspected sinusitis. Positive findings in imaging studies of sinuses such as opacities and thickened lining indicate the presence of inflammation, possibly infection, but may have poor correlation with clinical disease 9,10 and do not reveal any information on etiologies. Although sinus puncture would yield such information, 11 this cannot be performed in most nonsurgical office settings. Studies have documented that nasal culture is a poor reflection of the microbes in the sinus cavity. 12 Therefore, we analyzed the microbes from the osteomeatal area utilizing a quantitative PCR method in an attempt to detect the pathogens that may cohabit both sinus and nasal cavities."
,"Background: Researchers increasingly use social contact data to inform models for infectious disease spread with the aim of guiding effective policies about disease prevention and control. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible. Results: In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80% of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools or universities (37%), and health care/conference/research institutes (5%). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective (45%) and prospective (41%) designs were used most often with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies. Conclusions: We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.","transmission parameters (i.e., who infects whom?). The latter are the most influential drivers for the outputs of such models. Whereas 20th-century models made strong assumptions about mixing patterns, it has become increasingly common to use empirical data on social interactions as a direct model input over the last decade. 2, 3 For sexually transmitted infections, data from surveys on sexual behavior were available for use as an input for models. On the other hand, for infectious diseases that are transmitted by direct contact, minimal data on relevant social contacts was available. Edmunds et al 4 conducted a first study aimed to collect precisely this information using a convenience sample. This study was followed by a study that reported on relevant social contacts in a representative sample of the population that covered all ages in a city. 5 The landmark study that reported on relevant social contacts in representative samples for eight different European countries using contact diaries was the POLYMOD study. 6 Numerous other studies have been reported since. Several of these studies report on social mixing patterns as obtained through direct observation, contact diaries, or electronic proximity sensors. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods have been discussed. 7 Nevertheless, to our knowledge, a comprehensive review of the study designs for contact diaries and of major determinants of mixing patterns is lacking for this rapidly growing field of research, a gap which we aim to fill here."
The use of equine influenza pseudotypes for serological screening,"Standard assays used for influenza serology present certain practical issues, such as inter-laboratory variability, complex protocols and the necessity for handling certain virus strains in high biological containment facilities. In an attempt to address this, avian and human influenza HA pseudotyped retroviruses have been successfully employed in antibody neutralization assays. In this study we generated an equine influenza pseudotyped lentivirus for serological screening. This was achieved by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of an H3N8 subtype equine influenza virus strain, HIV gag-pol and firefly luciferase reporter genes and harvesting virus from supernatant. In order to produce infective pseudotype particles it was necessary to additionally co-transfect a plasmid encoding the TMPRSS2 endoprotease to cleave the HA. High titre pseudotype virus (PV) was then used in PV antibody neutralization assays (PVNAs) to successfully distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated equines. The sera were also screened by single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay. There was a 65% correlation between the results of the two assays, with the PVNA assay appearing slightly more sensitive. Future work will extend the testing of the PVNA with a larger number of serum samples to assess sensitivity/specificity, inter/intra-laboratory variability and to define a protective titre.","Influenza infections in equine species are relatively common and can have significant economic impact. The primary clinical manifestation is acute respiratory disease. To date, infections have only been associated with two subtypes; H3N8 and H7N7. There have been no isolations of H7N7 virus from horses for over 30 years (Webster, 1993) , but viruses of the H3N8 subtype continue to cause outbreaks regularly across the globe, some affecting large numbers of animals (reviewed in Daly et al, 2011) ."
The Plant Pathology Journal siRNAs Derived from Cymbidium Mosaic Virus and Odontoglossum Ringspot Virus Down-modulated the Expression Levels of Endogenous Genes in Phalaenopsis equestris,"Phalaenopsis equestris remain largely unknown, which led to deficiency of effective measures to control disease of P. equestris caused by infecting viruses. In this study, for the first time, we characterized viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) profiles in P. equestris co-infected with CymMV and ORSV through small RNA sequencing technology. CymMV and ORSV small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) demonstrated several general and specific/new characteristics. vsiRNAs, with A/ U bias at the first nucleotide, were predominantly 21-nt long and they were derived predominantly (90%) from viral positive-strand RNA. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 0-nt overhangs were the most abundant 21-nt duplexes, followed by 2-nt overhangs and then 1-nt overhangs 21-nt duplexes in infected P. equestris. Continuous but heterogeneous distribution and secondary structures prediction implied that vsiRNAs originate predominantly by direct Dicer-like enzymes cleavage of imperfect duplexes in the most folded regions of the positive strand of both viruses RNA molecular. Furthermore, we totally predicted 54 target genes by vsiRNAs with psRNATarget server, including disease/stress responserelated genes, RNA interference core components, cytoskeleton-related genes, photosynthesis or energy supply related genes. Gene Ontology classification showed that a majority of the predicted targets were related to cellular components and cellular processes and performed a certain function. All target genes were down-regulated with different degree by vsiRNAs as shown by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, CymMV and ORSV siRNAs played important roles in interplay with P. equestris by down modulating the expression levels of endogenous genes in host plant.","Interplay between CymMV/ORSV and Phalaenopsis equestris by sRNA-seq 509 (RNAi). In eukaryotes, upon viral infection RNAi employs Dicer and Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes to cleave viral RNAs into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with sizes about 21 nucleotides (nt), which are further amplified by RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs). These siRNAs are loaded into argonaute to form the RNA induced silencing complex to specifically silence target genes (Baulcombe, 2006; Ding, 2010) . Based on the mechanism, Kreuz et al., first proposed that high-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) can be used as a routine method to detect various DNA or RNA viruses (Kreuze et al., 2009) . Subsequently, to streamline this technology, Li et al. (2012 Li et al. ( , 2013 Li et al. ( , 2015 explored the VirusDetect, a bioinformatics pipeline that can efficiently analyze large scale small RNA (sRNA) datasets for both known and novel virus identification in plants and animals (Li et al., , 2013 Zheng et al., 2017) . Furthermore, Wu et al. (2010) also suggested a possibility of using sRNAs for viral genome assembly and virus discovery in invertebrate, such as fruit fly, mosquito and nematode. Recently, the method was used to detect the human viruses . In this study, we also identified and characterized the CymMV and ORSVderived siRNAs and predicted its host target genes from disease P. equestris plants through sRNA-seq to investigate the interaction between these two viruses and its host plant."
PROTECTION PERFORMANCE OF BIOLOGICAL PPE 521 Performance of materials used for biological personal protective equipment against blood splash penetration,"For occupational safety, healthcare workers must select and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), protective clothing, and masks as countermeasures against exposure to infectious body fluids and blood splash. It is important for healthcare workers to ensure the protective performance of each PPE against penetration of pathogens. The International Standards Organization (ISO) 22609 test evaluates the effectiveness of medical facemasks to protect against penetration of splashed synthetic blood. However, in this method, the protective performance is determined only visually, without quantification of leaked liquid volume. Therefore, in this study, we modified the ISO 22609 test method to quantify the volume of leaked liquid and obtain a more accurate assessment of the protection performance. We tested non-woven and woven materials used for masks or protective clothing, and the performance of each material was classified using this new method. We found that the quantity of leaked synthetic blood was dependent on the structural characteristics of each material. These findings will allow healthcare workers to select the most appropriate PPE for a given situation or task.","Accidental occupational infections occur in laboratories, hospitals, and animal handling facilities as well as in some industries, pharmaceutical and food production, and agriculture 1) ."
Advance Access Publication,"Licorice, Glycyrrhizae radix, is one of the herbal medicines in East Asia that has been commonly used for treating various diseases, including stomach disorders. This study investigated the effect of licorice on arsenite (As)-induced cytotoxicity in H4IIE cells, a rat hepatocyte-derived cell line. Cell viability was significantly diminished in As-treated H4IIE cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, results from flow cytometric assay and DNA laddering in H4IIE cells showed that As treatment induced apoptotic cell death by activating caspase-3. Licorice (0.1 and 1.0 mg ml À1 ) treatment significantly inhibited cell death and the activity of caspase-3 in response to As exposure. These results demonstrate that licorice induced a cytoprotective effect against As-induced cell death by inhibition of caspase-3.","Licorice, Glycyrrhizae radix, is one of the oriental herbal medicines that has been most frequently prescribed for the treatment of various diseases including stomach disorders (1) .

NOTE Repeated avian infectious bronchitis virus infections within a single chicken farm,"Genotyping of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was performed on trachea and kidney samples of six chickens obtained from a single farm in Japan. Using two primer sets targeting the spike (S) protein gene, the S1 and S2 regions of DNA fragments were amplified. Sequences of amplified S1 fragments extracted from both organs were identical among the six chickens, showing a JP-I genotype. Sequences of amplified S2 fragments differed between trachea and kidney samples. The kidney profile showed a group IV genotype, whereas the trachea profile showed an unclassified group. This result showed that two different IBVs infected the six chickens. The first IBV infection induced poor protective immunity in this farm, permitting a second IBV infection to occur.","Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious pathogen of chickens that replicates primarily in the upper respiratory tract. Secondary replication also occurs in the lower respiratory tract and non-respiratory epithelial cells of the alimentary tract, kidney, and gonads, suggesting various pathologies depend on the type of infected tissue [1] . IBV infection affects egg production of laying hens and growth of broiler chickens, leading to economic losses in the poultry industry that cannot be ignored [3] . IBV is spread by aerosol and is endemic in many countries where chickens are farmed."

Triggering through CD16 or Phorbol Esters Enhances Adhesion of NK Cells to Laminin via Very Late Antigen 6,"Very late antigens VLA-1, VLA 2, VLA-3, and VLA6, belonging to the 01 subfamily of integrins, have been identified as receptors for different binding domains of laminin (LM).

Binding assays performed on LM-coated plates showed that 10-15% of NK cells spontaneously adhere to LM, and this adhesion is mediated by VLA-6 . Activation of NK cells through CD16 triggering or by phorbol ester results in a rapid increase of adhesion to LM, which is still mediated by VLA-6 . The enhanced adhesiveness is not associated with changes in (31 LM receptor expression, while it correlates with changes in the phosphorylation status of cx6 subunit . The expression of VLA6 on NK cells and the modulation of its avidity by activating stimuli may be relevant for NK cell migration and tissue location during inflammation or immune response.","Very late antigens VLA-1, VLA 2, VLA-3, and VLA6, belonging to the 01 subfamily of integrins, have been identified as receptors for different binding domains of laminin (LM).

MMDB: annotating protein sequences with Entrez's 3D-structure database,"Three-dimensional (3D) structure is now known for a large fraction of all protein families. Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) precomputed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's 'Related Structure' links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded. The 'Related Structure' service summarizes this information and presents 3D views mapping sequence residues onto all 3D structures available in MMDB (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=structure).","Experimental three-dimensional (3D) structure data are obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (2) . Authorannotated features provided by PDB are recorded in MMDB. The agreement between atomic coordinate and sequence data is verified, and sequence data are obtained from PDB coordinate records, if necessary, to resolve ambiguities (3) . Data are mapped into a computer friendly format and transferred between applications using Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1). This validation and encoding supports the interoperable display of sequence, structure and alignment. Uniformly defined secondary-structure and 3D-domain features are added to support structure neighbor calculations.

A Role for IFITM Proteins in Restriction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection,"The interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are critical mediators of the host antiviral response. Here, we expand the role of IFITM proteins to host defense against intracellular bacterial infection by demonstrating that they restrict Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) intracellular growth. Simultaneous knockdown of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 by RNAi significantly enhances MTb growth in human monocytic and alveolar/epithelial cells, whereas individual overexpression of each IFITM impairs MTb growth in these cell types. Furthermore, MTb infection, Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 ligands, and several proinflammatory cytokines induce IFITM1-3 gene expression in human myeloid cells. We find that IFITM3 co-localizes with early and, in particular, late MTb phagosomes, and overexpression of IFITM3 enhances endosomal acidification in MTb-infected monocytic cells. These findings provide evidence that the antiviral IFITMs participate in the restriction of mycobacterial growth, and they implicate IFITM-mediated endosomal maturation in its antimycobacterial activity.","Successful intracellular pathogens often use strategies to gain access to cellular compartments required for their survival ahead of the initiation of innate host antimicrobial mechanisms. The well-characterized interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane (IFITM) gene family encodes highly conserved proteins that act at early steps post-viral entry, thereby precluding establishment of productive infection (Diamond and Farzan, 2013) . In humans, three IFITMs (IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3) are widely expressed, and the genes encoding these restriction factors are activated by types I and II IFN stimulation via IFN-sensitive response elements (ISREs) in their regulatory regions (Ackrill et al., 1991; Friedman et al., 1984; Kelly et al., 1985; Lewin et al., 1991; Reid et al., 1989) . While IFITM1-3 share substantial sequence similarity, IFITM1 primarily is found at the cell periphery due to its lack of an N-terminal 21 amino acid sequence that promotes IFITM2 and IFITM3 recruitment to late endosomal/lysosomal membranes (Jia et al., 2012; John et al., 2013; Weston et al., 2014) ."
Development of a mouse-feline chimeric antibody against feline tumor necrosis factor-alpha,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal inflammatory disease caused by FIP virus infection. Feline tumor necrosis factor (fTNF)-alpha is closely involved in the aggravation of FIP pathology. We previously described the preparation of neutralizing mouse anti-fTNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb 2-4) and clarified its role in the clinical condition of cats with FIP using in vitro systems. However, administration of mouse mAb 2-4 to cat may lead to a production of feline anti-mouse antibodies. In the present study, we prepared a mouse-feline chimeric mAb (chimeric mAb 2-4) by fusing the variable region of mouse mAb 2-4 to the constant region of feline antibody. The chimeric mAb 2-4 was confirmed to have fTNF-alpha neutralization activity. Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were repeatedly administered to cats, and the changes in the ability to induce feline anti-mouse antibody response were investigated. In the serum of cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4, feline anti-mouse antibody production was induced, and the fTNF-alpha neutralization effect of mouse mAb 2-4 was reduced. In contrast, in cats treated with chimeric mAb 2-4, the feline anti-mouse antibody response was decreased compared to that of mouse mAb 2-4-treated cats.","Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation [13] . Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid were reported to accumulate in some cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV [2, 16] . FECV and FIPV cannot be serologically or genetically distinguished from each other; however, FECV infection is normally asymptomatic in cats."
Nanoparticle Vaccines Adopting Virus-like Features for Enhanced Immune Potentiation,"Synthetic nanoparticles play an increasingly significant role in vaccine design and development as many nanoparticle vaccines show improved safety and efficacy over conventional formulations. These nanoformulations are structurally similar to viruses, which are nanoscale pathogenic organisms that have served as a key selective pressure driving the evolution of our immune system. As a result, mechanisms behind the benefits of nanoparticle vaccines can often find analogue to the interaction dynamics between the immune system and viruses. This review covers the advances in vaccine nanotechnology with a perspective on the advantages of virus mimicry towards immune potentiation. It provides an overview to the different types of nanomaterials utilized for nanoparticle vaccine development, including functionalization strategies that bestow nanoparticles with virus-like features. As understanding of human immunity and vaccine mechanisms continue to evolve, recognizing the fundamental semblance between synthetic nanoparticles and viruses may offer an explanation for the superiority of nanoparticle vaccines over conventional vaccines and may spur new design rationales for future vaccine research. These nanoformulations are poised to provide solutions towards pressing and emerging human diseases.","Vaccination is a process of introducing antigenic material to activate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. It has proven to be the most successful and cost-effective prophylactic measure against infectious diseases. Vaccines have been responsible for eradicating or effectively managing many major diseases, including smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and yellow fever [1] . Despite the many examples of successful vaccines, many disease threats, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, dengue, and malaria, lack an effective prophylactic measure. Thus, development of new vaccine formulations and technology remains an ongoing quest [2] . Conventionally, vaccine formulations are comprised of biological materials in the form of attenuated viruses, killed pathogens, or subunit protein antigens. Each platform has its distinct advantages and shortcomings, frequently presenting a trade-off between safety and efficacy. For example, live attenuated vaccines are excellent at inducing long lasting protective immunity and strong immune response, but their ""live"" nature poses safety concerns, especially to individuals who may be immunocompromised. On the other hand, subunit vaccines are safer to administer, but they are less immunogenic and less effective at eliciting cellular immunity for disease protection (Fig. 1) . Emerging technology and formulations to combine the advantages of live attenuated and subunit vaccines thus continue to be developed with the aim of maximizing vaccine safety and potency."
"Point-of-View Making vaccines ""on demand"" A potential solution for emerging pathogens and biodefense?","Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) has made great strides in strategic preparedness and response capabilities. There have been numerous advances in planning, biothreat countermeasure development, licensure, manufacturing, stockpiling and deployment. Increased biodefense surveillance capability has dramatically improved, while new tools and increased awareness have fostered rapid identification of new potential public health pathogens. Unfortunately, structural delays in vaccine design, development, manufacture, clinical testing and licensure processes remain significant obstacles to an effective national biodefense rapid response capability. This is particularly true for the very real threat of ""novel pathogens"" such as the avian-origin influenzas H7N9 and H5N1, and new coronaviruses such as hCoV-EMC. Conventional approaches to vaccine development, production, clinical testing and licensure are incompatible with the prompt deployment needed for an effective public health response. An alternative approach, proposed here, is to apply computational vaccine design tools and rapid production technologies that now make it possible to engineer vaccines for novel emerging pathogen and WMD biowarfare agent countermeasures in record time. These new tools have the potential to significantly reduce the time needed to design string-of-epitope vaccines for previously unknown","pathogens. The design process-from genome to gene sequence, ready to insert in a DNA plasmid-can now be accomplished in less than 24 h. While these vaccines are by no means ""standard,"" the need for innovation in the vaccine design and production process is great. Should such vaccines be developed, their 60-d start-to-finish timeline would represent a 2-fold faster response than the current standard."
N-Myc expression enhances the oncolytic effects of vesicular stomatitis virus in human neuroblastoma cells,"N-myc oncogene amplification is associated but not present in all cases of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). Since oncogene expression could often modulate sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, we wanted to examine if N-myc expression status would determine virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that induction of exogenous N-myc in a non-N-myc-amplified cell line background (TET-21N) increased susceptibility to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (mutant VSVΔM51) and alleviated the type I IFN-induced antiviral state. Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSVΔM51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFNstimulated antiviral state. Our studies suggest the potential utility of N-myc amplification/overexpression as a predictive biomarker of virotherapy response for high-risk NB using IFN-sensitive oncolytic viruses.","Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common cancer in the first years of life, and the most common solid tumor of childhood. Patients are risk-stratified using a combination of clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics. The survival of patients with high-risk disease has not improved and remains less than 60%. 1 Historically, standard therapy for high-risk disease includes chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and bone marrow transplant, which appear to provide some control of disease progression, but is complicated by significant morbidity and mortality. 2, 3 Innovative approaches such as GD-2 antibody-mediated immune therapy have demonstrated the first improvements in survival for high-risk NB patients in over two decades, though mechanisms limiting its efficacy still occur. 4 Therefore, novel approaches to this disease are necessary. Viral oncolysis is a novel approach to NB that has shown promise in various preclinical cancer models. 5, 6 Despite their promise as therapeutics, oncolytic viruses (OVs) face application hurdles due to our incomplete understanding of the role of the tumor microenviroment and antiviral immune responses on virotherapy. In general, OVs can selectively kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells intact. 7 They achieve this by exploiting the same cellular defects that promote tumor growth. One of such defects is the type I interferon (IFN) signaling, which sensitizes tumor cells to IFN-sensitive OVs such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus. [8] [9] [10] In this study, we used VSV based on its known efficacy as a potent oncolytic agent to several tumor types. [11] [12] [13] The deletion of a single amino acid of the M-protein (VSVΔM51) increases safety by restricting its infection to cancer cells with defects in type I IFN response. 13, 14 However, tumors with functional type I IFN signaling can hamper its clinical application. 12 N-myc amplification, although not present in all cases, 15 is the best-characterized aberrant genetic alteration associated with poor prognosis in high-risk NB. 16 The mechanisms whereby MYC proteins (c-myc, N-myc and L-myc) sensitize cancer cells to OVs remain unexplored. Previous studies have shown that some c-myc-amplified cancer cell lines are highly susceptible to VSV-induced cell killing. 17 Though not studied in the context of oncolytic virotherapy, c-myc negatively regulates type I IFN signaling through STAT-1, which is one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis in Burkitt's lymphoma and uveal melanoma. 18, 19 Since oncogenic expression often correlates with increased susceptibility of cancer cells to OVs [20] [21] [22] and the effects of N-myc on virotherapy are unknown, we reasoned that N-myc overexpression, due to amplification, could be a clinically important biomarker of virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that N-myc-amplified NB cell lines and a non-N-myc-amplified cell line (TET-21N) induced Since VSV infection induces the expression of type I IFNs, 27 we hypothesized that N-myc-driven regulation of these cytokines promoted differential susceptibility of all NB cells to virus-induced cell killing. As positive controls for these assays, cells were treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) for 12 hours. Poly I:C is a strong inducer of type I IFNs when delivered intracellularly (transfection) or extracellularly (in cell culture medium). Intracellular and extracellular poly I:C mainly activate the retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) and toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3) signaling, respectively, for the expression of type I IFNs. 28 Cells were either infected at MOI of 0.1 or treated with poly I:C (intracellular and extracellular) and cells and cell culture supernatants were harvested at indicated time points. Secreted IFN-β was detected and quantified by ELISA while RT-PCR was used to detect the transcription of IFNs-α and -β."
Effect of acetate Ringer ' s solution with or without 5% dextrose administered intravenously to diarrheic calves,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of intravenous acetate Ringer's solution, with or without dextrose, on diarrheic calves with either experimentally induced or spontaneous diarrhea. In the experimental model, diarrhea was induced in nine healthy calves by administering cold milk (below 4°C) twice a day for 2 days. The calves were randomly assigned to the isotonic saline (ISS), acetated Ringer's (AR) or acetated Ringer's with 5% dextrose (ARD) groups, with three calves assigned to each group. The calves received 80 ml/kg of their designated solution, at a flow rate of 20 ml/kg/hr. Infusion of ISS, AR and ARD were all found to be safe and effective in increasing plasma volume. Intravenous (IV) infusion of ISS resulted in the acidification secondary to dilution, while AR and ARD infusion inhibited acidification. In addition, prevention of catabolism was observed only with IV infusion of ARD. Sixteen calves with spontaneous diarrhea were enrolled in the clinical study. The calves were randomly assigned to the AR or ARD groups, with eight calves being assigned to each group. The calves received 100 ml/kg of their designated solution, at a flow rate of 25 ml/kg/hr. Intravenous infusion of AR and ARD was found to be effective in increasing plasma volume and inhibiting acidification. Only infusion of ARD prevented catabolism, but it also led to hyperglycemia. Our results suggest that a solution containing dextrose may be beneficial for wasting diarrheic calves.","Neonatal diarrhea remains the most common cause of death in beef and dairy calves, and is a major source of economic loss in the cattle industry [18] . Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus and coronavirus appear to be the most important causes of infectious calf diarrhea. Calves are more sensitive to fluid loss than adult cattle, because of their higher total body water content and higher extracellular fluid volume. In addition, metabolic acidosis can occur secondary to diarrhea contingent on its severity and duration [22] . Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is important for decreasing mortality associated with diarrhea in calves."
Viral etiology of acute respiratory infections in pediatric patients in Lebanon,"Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of death worldwide, especially among children. The majority of these infections in children are of viral etiology. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of viral ARI among children in Lebanon. Patients and Methods: Children presenting with symptoms of ARI were prospectively recruited between September 2009 to February 2012. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from patients and screened for 11 respiratory viruses using a multiplex Luminex-based PCR assay. Results: Two hundred twenty-one patients were recruited with a median age of 1 year (IQR: 0 -5). Out of 221 patients, 116 (52.5%) were positive for at least one virus, the majority (103/116; 88.8%) of which were in children under 6-year of age. Overall, 188 viruses were detected. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed by coxsackie virus and echovirus (CVEV) which were detected as one target in the panel in 45 (38.8%), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV types : 1, 2, 3, 4) in 24 (20.7%) patients. Coinfection with more than one virus was detected in 49 (42.9%) patients. RhV and CVEV were the most common viruses associated with co-infections and higher risk of rhinorrhea. Conclusions: Viral pathogens account for at least half of the ARIs in Lebanon, with a high frequency of co-infections being detected.","Introduction. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are among the most common reasons for primary care consultations. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks ARIs as the fourth major killer after cardiovascular diseases, general infections and parasitic diseases, and cancer. 2 ARIs cause 4 million death globally. The burden is especially high in children where ARIs are responsible for 11-22% of deaths. 3 ARIs can lead to severe complications requiring hospitalizations and can have fatal outcomes."
s-RT-MELT for rapid mutation scanning using enzymatic selection and real time DNA-melting: new potential for multiplex genetic analysis,"The rapidly growing understanding of human genetic pathways, including those that mediate cancer biology and drug response, leads to an increasing need for extensive and reliable mutation screening on a population or on a single patient basis. Here we describe s-RT-MELT, a novel technology that enables highly expanded enzymatic mutation scanning in human samples for germline or low-level somatic mutations, or for SNP discovery. GC-clamp-containing PCR products from interrogated and wild-type samples are hybridized to generate mismatches at the positions of mutations over one or multiple sequences in-parallel. Mismatches are converted to double-strand breaks using a DNA endonuclease (Surveyor TM ) and oligonucleotide tails are enzymatically attached at the position of mutations. A novel application of PCR enables selective amplification of mutationcontaining DNA fragments. Subsequently, melting curve analysis, on conventional or nano-technology real-time PCR platforms, detects the samples that contain mutations in a high-throughput and closed-tube manner. We apply s-RT-MELT in the screening of p53 and EGFR mutations in cell lines and clinical samples and demonstrate its advantages for rapid, multiplexed mutation scanning in cancer and for genetic variation screening in biology and medicine.","Screening for genetic changes to unveil molecular attributes of human specimens is important for a variety of medical applications, including genotyping for inherited disorders, prediction of the pathologic behavior of malignancies, identification of cancer biomarkers and can affect treatment decisions for individual patients (1) (2) (3) . For example, mutations in genes like EGFR can profoundly influence chemotherapeutic response in lung cancer (2) (3) (4) (5) and the response is modulated by mutations in other genes of the same signaling pathway [e.g. K-ras, HER2, ErbB-3 (1, 6) ]. Therefore there is a need for efficient and high-throughput mutation screening of multiple genes along identified signal transduction pathways in tumor samples. Because a large portion of cancer-causing genetic changes remains unknown and can occur in numerous positions along tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p53, ATM, PTEN) mutation scanning rather than detection of specific mutations is frequently required for molecular cancer profiling."
An unusual cause of fever of unknown origin with enlarged lymph nodes-relapsing polychondritis A case report,Introduction: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a common initial presentation leading to a diagnostic challenge.,"The term of fever of unknown origin (FUO) was coined in the 1960s to define a body temperature above 38.3°C for >3 weeks without diagnosis, despite a comprehensive physical examination together with exhaustive laboratory tests. [1] It was recorded that no etiology could be determined in 10% to 32% of fever cases. [2] As fever could be an atypical presentation of frequent clinical pictures, identifying the etiological diagnosis for FUO is a great challenge for the clinicians. Although the majority cases with FUO are progressing favorably, about 5% patients have a final ominous prognosis with a neoplastic diagnosis, establishing the importance of cautious differential diagnosis for FUO. During the process of etiological diagnosis for FUO, it is significant to carry out a systematic workup following a logical order to promote the diagnosis and treatment. Some physical signs would present concomitantly with long-term fever, such as lymph nodes enlargement, which may help reach a diagnosis, but not always."
Isolation and characterization of Korean porcine deltacoronavirus strain KNU16-07,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has emerged in several pig-raising countries and has been a causative pathogen associated with diarrheal diseases in South Korea since 2014. In the present study, we were able to isolate and cultivate a Korean PDCoV strain (KNU16-07) in cell culture and investigate its pathogenicity. PDCoV-inoculated piglets showed watery diarrhea accompanied by acute enteritis in the natural host. Sequencing analysis demonstrated the genetic stability of KNU16-07 for at least thirty serial passages.","Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging enterotropic swine coronavirus that causes acute enteritis in nursing piglets [7, 10] . PDCoV was first identified in Hong Kong, China in 2012 and, subsequently, has emerged in most major swine-producing nations in Asia and North America [11, 13, 14] . The presence of PDCoV in South Korea was first announced in early 2014 [7] . Our previous report indicated that monoinfection by PDCoV and coinfection by PDCoV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are common in pig herds in South Korea [4] ."
Immune protection conferred by three commonly used commercial live attenuated vaccines against the prevalent local strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus in southern China,"Live attenuated vaccines are critical in the control of avian infectious bronchitis. It is necessary to know the protection conferred by commonly used commercial live vaccines. In this study, specific pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated with the commercial live vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals for the detection of IBV-specific antibodies and quantification of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. At 21 days post-inoculation the vaccinated birds were challenged with the IBV prevalent local strains GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032, respectively. Trachea and kidney samples were collected at 5 days post-challenge for the detection of the virus. The results showed that the H120 group exhibited medium antibody levels, the lowest percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the highest viral loads. The 4/91 group showed the lowest antibody levels, but the highest percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the lowest viral loads. The LDT3-A group showed the highest antibody levels, the medium percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + T lymphocytes and the medium viral loads. The protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A groups were 41.7-58.3%, 75.0-83.7% and 66.7-75.0%, respectively. The present study demonstrated that the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could stimulate the immunized chicks to produce different levels of humoral and cellular immunity to resist the infection of IBV, but couldn't provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in southern China. Also, the vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection among the three vaccines.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. which has been issued by the official authority in China since 2011. In spite of extensive vaccination with these three vaccines in chickens in China, the disease is still epidemic in vaccinated flocks [6, [25] [26] [27] . In addition, IBV strains prevalent in a specific geographic region are distinct and unique, although some have a more general distribution [1, 2] . Hence, it is extremely critical to know whether these live, attenuated vaccines confer protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in particular regions or countries and whether the birds respond promptly to vaccination."
,"As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world. With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated. However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking. Here, we present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown. This report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.","values of rRT-PCR was converted into RNA copy number of SARS-CoV-2. The detection limit of quantitative PCR reaction was 2,690 copies/mL. Detailed methods and values for the tests are presented in the Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 to 3."
Isolation and characterization of a new porcine epidemic diarrhea virus variant that occurred in Korea in 2014,"Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have resulted in significant economic losses in the swine industry, and another PED outbreak occurred in 2014 in Korea. Isolating and culturing PED virus (PEDV) allow investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines and diagnostic assays. In this study, we successfully isolated two PEDV isolates (QIAP1401 and QIAP1402) from naturally infected piglets at Jeju-do, Korea. Viral propagation was confirmed in Vero cells based on cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopic analyses. The QIAP401 isolate propagated well in Vero cells for 70 passages, with titers of 10 6.5 to 10 7.0 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL, which increased gradually with passaging. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the QIAP1401 isolate were determined and compared with those of other PEDV isolates. The QIAP1401 isolate was determined to be closely related to the USA/Minnesota271/2014 strain (> 99.9% nucleotide similarity) that was isolated in the USA in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis based on several PEDV genes suggested that a new PEDV variant is circulating in the Korean swine industry, with 93.08% similarity to the SM98 strain isolated in 1998. In addition, the QIAP1401 strain showed strong virulence in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old growing pigs.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) induces vomiting, severe watery diarrhea, and dehydration in neonatal piglets, eventually leading to death. Since PEDV was first isolated (CV777 strain) in Belgium in 1978 [19] , PED outbreaks have been identified regularly in Europe and Asia, including Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam [7, 10, 20] . More recently, a PED outbreak occurred suddenly in the USA in 2013 and spread to Canada and Mexico [1, 17] . Since a live-attenuated PEDV vaccine was developed from a Korean PEDV isolate (SM98 strain) obtained from naturally infected piglets in Korea in 1998, PED vaccines have been used in pig farms to prevent PED outbreaks [11] . However, PED continues to be a major threat to the Korean pork industry [21] . In March 2014, a large number of PEDV infections occurred unexpectedly in many Korean pig farms, which had a significant economic impact on swine farms due to a high mortality rate among newborn piglets [12] ."
"INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and Financing","China has exploded onto the world economy over the past few decades and is undergoing rapid transformation toward relatively more services. The health sector is an important part of this transition. This article provides a historical account of the development of health care in China since 1949. It also focuses on health insurance and macroeconomic structural adjustment to less saving and more consumption. In particular, the question of how health insurance impacts precautionary savings is considered. Multivariate analysis using data from 1990 to 2012 is employed. The household savings rate is the dependent variable in 3 models segmented for rural and urban populations. Independent variables include out-of-pocket health expenditures, health insurance payouts, housing expenditure, education expenditure, and consumption as a share of gross domestic product (GDP). Out-of-pocket health expenditures were positively correlated with household savings rates. But health insurance remains weak, and increased payouts by health insurers have not been associated with lower levels of household savings so far. Housing was positively correlated, whereas education had a negative association with savings rates. This latter finding was unexpected. Perhaps education is perceived as investment and a substitute for savings. China's shift toward a more service-oriented economy includes growing dependence on the health sector. Better health insurance is an important part of this evolution. The organization and finance of health care is integrally linked with macroeconomic policy in an environment constrained by prevailing institutional convention. Problems of agency relationships, professional hegemony, and special interest politics feature prominently, as they do elsewhere. China also has a dual approach to medicine relying heavily on providers of traditional Chinese medicine. Both of these segments will take part in China's evolution, adding another layer of complexity to policy.","The rapid rise of China on the world economic stage has been impressive. A nation of 1.4 billion people has transformed from a primarily poor rural society to a prosperous majority urban one. China has divisions and controls between rural and urban populations partly to stem development of urban slums. This helps explain wide disparities in income and separate national accounting conventions. Urban per capita disposable income was already 85% greater than rural income in 1985, and the gap is even larger now. 1 But both urban and rural populations have seen sharp gains with real urban per capita disposable income in 2013 at 765% of the 1985 level. Real rural incomes were 497% of 1985 levels. The World Bank placed China at $13 216 in purchasing power parity per capita income in 2014, just above South Africa ($13,046). 2 This transition did not come easy. In 1912, China cast off the centuries-old Qing dynasty in an effort to modernize. Decades later, and after much tumult, communists consolidated power seeking economic growth and social advancement relying on a command economy. This approach was found wanting and replaced by a more market-friendly strategy. Economic growth has been brisk since 1979 and is only now decelerating for fundamentally structural reasons. 3 Growth has been fueled by movement of low-productivity agricultural workers to higher productivity manufacturing, construction, and service employment. It has also been underpinned by high levels of investment and exports. In addition, "
Inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease by flavonoids,"There were severe panics caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus. Therefore, researches targeting these viruses have been required. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been rising targets of some flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3 0 sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids. With the systematic analysis, the three flavonoids are suggested to be templates to design functionally improved inhibitors.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses with large, enveloped and positive senses that can infect both animals and humans 1 . CoVs, along with Artierivirdae and Roniviridae, belong to the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales. These CoVs can infect various hosts, including avian, swine and humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) represent a major group of CoVs associated with various respiratory diseases from common cold to serious pneumonia and bronchiolitis 2 . Today, HCoVs are recognised as one of the fastest-evolving viruses derived from their characteristic high genomic nucleotide replacement rates and recombination 3 . Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the first confirmed atypical pneumonia in China's Guangdong province, has spread to several countries. The most common symptoms of SARS include coughing, high fever (>38 C), chills, convulsions, headaches, dizziness and progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphopenia 4 . The severity of the disease shows a death rate of about 3% to 6%, although this rate could rise up to 43% to 55% for senior citizens older than 60 years 5 . The primary epidemic of SARS was eventually controlled, but a SARS CoV-like virus was detected in Chinese bats 6, 7 . Besides, a recent pandemic of middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus MERS-CoV raises fear of possible recurrence of SARS or related dangerous diseases 8, 9 . Since there is no vaccine and effective therapy for these viral infections, developing anti-SARS drugs against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge."
,"Background: Burden of disease can be used to prioritize the healthcare budget allocation. We analyzed the research and development (R&D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. Methods: The 2018 MOHW R&D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R&D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. Results: In 2018, the MOHW major R&D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R&D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R&D. Conclusions: It would be difficult to say that current R&D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R&D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R&D. A novel approach for allocating government R&D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered.","The year 2017 was significant for Korean health policy. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW), under President Moon's government, established new policies to promote healthy living in Korea. 1,2 These policies included ""enhancement of customized welfare services by life-cycle phase,"" ""establishment of health insurance system centered on people,"" and ""strengthening responses to demographic crisis."" The main investment directions of research and development (R&D) for the MOHW in connection with these policies are to promote new and more advanced medical industries, to reinforce public R&D, and to advance human-centered disease research (Fig. 1) . Although the growth of the government's total R&D budget is slowing, the R&D budget of the MOHW has steadily increased over the past seven years because of the recognition that health is vital to people's quality of life. The R&D budget of the MOHW is divided by 2 categories which are major R&D budget and general R&D budget. General R&D budget is used for institutional expenses and policy studies and so on. The major R&D budget of the MOHW was USD 435.1 million for 32 projects in 2018. 2 Previous research on principles for fund allocation identified some underlying factors: varying needs among recipients, competing goals in different sectors (university, industry, and national laboratories), and specific emerging policy issues. 3, 4 Evidence suggests that all these elements play a role in funding allocation. 4 In Korea, since the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was reported to the government in May 2015, there have been many changes in the government's support of R&D. There has also been an increase in the awareness of the importance of health system strengthening as a prerequisite to providing essential medical services during each stage of life. 1 To adapt to an ever-changing environment as well as to achieve the correct levels of resource allocation, decision makers should consider using a coherent, disciplined, and comprehensive approach for deciding on an allocation of R&D funds. One way to assess prioritization in health care budget is to match measures of the burden of disease, such as disability adjusted life years (DALYs), along with economic burden and budget prioritization. 5 The aim of this study, then, was to investigate whether the MOHW's R&D budget has responded to the burden of diseases in Korea."
Coronavirus Induction of Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex Expression in Murine Astrocytes Is Virus Strain Specific,"Neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) such as MHV-A59 (A59) and MHV-4 (JHMV) cause acute and chronic encephalomyelitis and demyelination in susceptible strains of mice and rats. They are widely used as models of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which immune mechanisms are thought to participate in the development of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). The effects of MHV infection on target cell functions in the CNS are not well understood, but A59 has been shown to induce the expression of MHC class I molecules in glial cells after in vivo and in vitro infection. Changes in class I expression in infected cells may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of MHV infection in the CNS. In this communication, a large panel of MHV strains was tested for their ability to stimulate class I expression in primary astrocytes in vitro. The data show that the more hepatotropic strains, such as MHV-A59, MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-NuU, were potent inducers of class I expression in astrocytes during acute infection, measured by radioimmunoassay. The K b molecule was preferentially expressed over D b. By contrast, JHMV and several viral strains derived from it did not stimulate the expression of class I molecules. Assays of virus infectivity indicated that the class I-inducing activity did not correlate with the ability of the individual viral strain to replicate in astrocytes. However, exposure of the viruses or the supernatants from infected astrocytes to ultraviolet light abolished the class I-inducing activity, indicating that infectious virus is required for class I expression. These data also suggest that class I expression was induced directly by virus infection, and not by the secretion of a soluble substance into the medium by infected astrocytes. Finally, analyses of A59/JHMV recombinant viral strains suggest that class I-inducing activity resides in one of the A59 structural genes.","M ouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) 1 are members of the Coronaviridae, which cause gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory diseases in a wide variety of mammalian species (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Although some MHV strains, such as A59 and MHV-3, can cause both gastrointestinal and neurological disease in mice and rats, many tend to induce pathology that is restricted to either system, prompting their classification as hepatotropic or neurotropic. There has been considerable interest in the study of the more neurotropic strains of MHV, such as JHMV and A59, because of their ability to produce demyelinating lesions that resemble the demyelinating plaques observed in the human neurological disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, MHV and human coronavirus iso- 1013 lates are capable of inducing demyelination in primates (8) , and coronavirus RNA and antigen have been detected in demyelinating lesions in the brains of MS patients (9, 10) ."
INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR-1 MEDIATES ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGE PYROPTOSIS DURING LPS-INDUCED ACUTE LUNG INJURY IN MICE,"Previously, we demonstrated that pyroptosis in alveolar macrophages (AMs) plays an essential role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we show that the absence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in genetic knock-out mice strongly abrogates pyroptosis in AMs and alleviates the LPS-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation. Our study demonstrates that IRF-1 contributes to caspase-1 activation and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain pyroptosome formation in AMs and leads to downstream inflammatory cytokine release, including that of IL-1b, IL-18, and HMGB1. The nuclear translocation of IRF-1 is linked to the presence of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our findings suggest that pyroptosis and the downstream inflammatory response in AMs induced by LPS is a process that is dependent on TLR4-mediated up-regulation of IRF-1. In summary, IRF-1 plays a key role in controlling caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis and inflammation.","Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are serious clinical disorders of the lung. The mortality rates resulting from ALI/ARDS in intensive care units (ICUs) remain high at 30% to 40% (1) . Sepsis is one of the main risk factors for ARDS, and many animal models of sepsis have been developed to study ALI (2) . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) models of inflammation have not reproduced the complex physiology of sepsis and our study focuses mainly on sepsisrelated ARDS. So identification of novel and effective therapeutic targets and approaches is vital if the outcomes in ARDS cases are to be improved. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) account for the 90% of the cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (3) . In view of the role AMs as guardians for the alveolar-blood interface against airborne particles and microbes, their pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS has recently come under close scrutiny."
"The standard of care of patients with ARDS: ventilatory settings and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia Introduction: hypoxemia in ARDS: definition, monitoring, and pitfalls","Purpose: Severe ARDS is often associated with refractory hypoxemia, and early identification and treatment of hypoxemia is mandatory. For the management of severe ARDS ventilator settings, positioning therapy, infection control, and supportive measures are essential to improve survival.","The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by life-threatening impairment of pulmonary gas exchange, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis and requiring acute rescue measures. Oxygen delivery to the tissues is necessary for all aerobic life, and tissue hypoxia will result in various deleterious effects including altered vascular reactivity, inflammation, cell apoptosis, and organ dysfunction or failure [1] . Tissue hypoxia is the result of hypoxemia, and hypoxemia is a consequence of insufficient support of the respiratory system and/or of the oxygen delivery system (cardiac output, hemoglobin level [2] ). Unfortunately, a precise and ""simple"" limit area to hypoxemia has not been identified and a ""critical"" level at which harm appears might vary between organs and patients. Furthermore, it is not known whether critically ill patients have the same spectrum of compensatory mechanisms to hypoxemia as the ""normal"" human body, and the rapidity of onset (""acclimatization effect""), severity, and duration of hypoxemia may determine the induction of tissue hypoxia."
Addressing the selectivity and toxicity of antiviral nucleosides,"Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have played significant roles in antiviral therapies and are valued for their impressive potency and high barrier to resistance. They have been approved for treatment of herpes simplex virus-1, HIV, HBV, HCV, and influenza, and new drugs are being developed for the treatment of RSV, Ebola, coronavirus MERS, and other emerging viruses. However, this class of compounds has also experienced a high attrition rate in clinical trials due to toxicity. In this review, we discuss the utility of different biochemical and cell-based assays and provide recommendations for assessing toxicity liability before entering animal toxicity studies.","Nucleoside analogs were first studied as antimetabolites in the 1950s by George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion. 1 Their work led to the discovery of treatments for leukemia, gout, hyperuricemia, and parasitic protozoan infection, as well as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant. These efforts paved the way for the discovery of a series of nucleoside analogs as antitumor agents in the 1970s, some of which, such as ara-C and gemcitabine (Figure 1 ), are still in use today. 2, 3 Many of these antitumor nucleoside analogs showed antiviral activity, but none of them possessed an adequate clinical safety profile for antiviral use until Acyclovir (Figure 1 ) was discovered for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, a breakthrough that started a new era in antiviral therapy. 1 Acyclovir's remarkable safety profile stemmed from two properties: (1) activation of the compound to its monophosphate (MP) only occurs in virus-infected cells, since this process relies on a viral thymidine kinase; and (2) acyclovir 5'-triphosphate (TP) selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase over host DNA polymerase a. 4 Follow on generations of HSV nucleoside antivirals (penciclovir and ganciclovir, Figure 1 ) and prodrugs were developed to improve potency and resistance profiles. 5 The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s presented unprecedented demand for effective antivirals."
An H5N1-based matrix protein 2 ectodomain tetrameric peptide vaccine provides cross-protection against lethal infection with H7N9 influenza virus,"In March 2013, a patient infected with a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus was reported in China. Since then, there have been 458 confirmed infection cases and 177 deaths. The virus contains several human-adapted markers, indicating that H7N9 has pandemic potential. The outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Previously, we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of the H5N1 virus (H5N1-M2e) could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. In this study, we investigated the cross-protection of H5N1-M2e against lethal infection with the new H7N9 virus. Although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13, 14, 18, 20, and 21 between M2e of H5N1 and H7N9, H5N1-M2e vaccination with either Freund's adjuvant or the Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) induced a high level of anti-M2e antibody, which cross-reacted with H7N9-M2e peptide. A mouse-adapted H7N9 strain, A/Anhui/01/2013m, was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments. H5N1-M2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the H7N9 virus. Reduced viral replication and histopathological damage of mouse lungs were also observed in the vaccinated mice. Our results suggest that the tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections. Therefore, this vaccine may be an ideal candidate for developing a universal vaccine to prevent the reemergence of avian influenza A H7N9 virus and the emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus.","Since the first human infection by a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus was reported in March 2013, a total of 458 confirmed cases with 177 deaths in China had been reported by December 2014. 1 After a relatively silent period from July to October 2013, in which only four cases with one death were reported, the virus has reemerged since November 2013, resulting in the second outbreak in China. 2 This novel influenza virus can bind to both avian (alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid) and human (alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid) receptors. 3 It also contains human-adapted amino acid markers. 4, 5 These adaptations may explain why the virus can cause outbreaks in the human population. 6 Patients infected with the H7N9 virus typically show symptoms such as fever, cough, opacities, and consolidation on chest radiography, and some severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. 4 Although the lethality of H7N9 influenza is comparatively lower than that of highly pathogenic H5N1 viral infection, it is much higher than that of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza, reaching approximately 30%. 7 Furthermore, highpathogenicity markers for human-adapted influenza virus, such as an E637K amino acid substitution in the PB2 gene and Q226L in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, have been identified in recent isolates of the H7N9 virus, 4 suggesting that the virus might become more virulent in humans. Thus, the pandemic potential of lethal H7N9 influenza has raised public concern."
A phylogenetically distinct Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus detected in a dromedary calf from a closed dairy herd in Dubai with rising seroprevalence with age,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was detected by monoclonal antibody-based nucleocapsid protein-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RNA detection, and viral culture from the nasal sample of a 1-month-old dromedary calf in Dubai with sudden death. Whole genome phylogeny showed that this MERS-CoV strain did not cluster with the other MERS-CoV strains from Dubai that we reported recently. Instead, it formed a unique branch more closely related to other MERS-CoV strains from patients in Qatar and Hafr-Al-Batin in Saudi Arabia, as well as the MERS-CoV strains from patients in the recent Korean outbreak, in which the index patient acquired the infection during travel in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Non-synonymous mutations, resulting in 11 unique amino acid differences, were observed between the MERS-CoV genome from the present study and all the other available MERS-CoV genomes. Among these 11 unique amino acid differences, four were found in ORF1ab, three were found in the S1 domain of the spike protein, and one each was found in the proteins encoded by ORF4b, ORF5, envelope gene, and ORF8. MERS-CoV detection for all other 254 dromedaries in this closed dairy herd was negative by nucleocapsid protein-capture ELISA and RNA detection. MERS-CoV IgG sero-positivity gradually increased in dromedary calves with increasing age, with positivity rates of 75% at zero to three months, 79% at four months, 89% at five to six months, and 90% at seven to twelve months. The development of a rapid antigen detection kit for instantaneous diagnosis is warranted.","Since its first appearance in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has affected more than 25 countries in four continents, with more than 1300 cases and a frightening fatality rate of greater than 30%. 1 A novel lineage C betacoronavirus the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed to be the etiological agent. 2,3 The subsequent detection of MERS-CoV and its antibodies in dromedaries in various countries in the Middle East has led to the hypothesis that these animals may be the reservoir for MERS-CoV. 4-13 Furthermore, the discovery of other closely related lineage C betacoronaviruses both before and after the beginning of the MERS epidemic in various bat species and hedgehogs, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] as well as the demonstration of the ability of the spike protein of Tylonecteris bat CoV HKU4 to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, have also suggested that these animals may be the hosts for the ancestor of MERS-CoV. [19] [20] [21] [22] Although MERS-CoV can be cultured and antibody detection methods are available, laboratory diagnosis and epidemiology studies of MERS-CoV infections are mainly achieved by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time qRT-PCR), using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the region upstream of the envelope gene or the nucleocapsid (N) gene of MERS-CoV as the target. 1,23-27 However, the cost of real-time qRT-PCR is still high and such expertise may not be available, particularly in some clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East where most of the cases were identified. Because enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antigen detection offers an inexpensive and user-friendly approach for laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological studies of respiratory viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, 28, 29 we recently developed a monoclonal antibodybased capture ELISA for the detection of MERS-CoV N protein. 30 In this study, we describe the application of N protein ELISA, real-time qRT-PCR, isothermal amplification, virus isolation, and antibody detection in a cross-sectional epidemiological study of a dromedary dairy herd in Dubai after sudden death and the detection of MERS-CoV from a dromedary calf within the herd."
,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin superfamily and its presence was initially observed in activated neutrophils. It has previously been demonstrated that the expression of NGAL is markedly increased in stimulated epithelia, and is important in the innate immunological response to various pathophysiological conditions, including infection, cancer, inflammation and kidney injury. The present study constructed a ventilator-associated lung injury model in mice. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. In addition, NGAL protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were measured via western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that NGAL expression increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments. The increase was most prominent in the high peak inflation pressure and high-volume mechanical ventilation groups, where there was the greatest extent of lung injury. In addition, NGAL expression increased in a time-dependent manner under high-volume mechanical ventilation, consistent with the degree of lung injury. These findings suggested that NGAL may serve as a potential novel biomarker in ventilator-associated lung injury.","Mechanical ventilation may induce and exacerbate lung injury, in contrast to its lifesaving effects. It has previously been demonstrated that biotrauma is an underlying mechanism of lung injury, important factors of which include inflammation and the innate immune response (1) . Biological markers of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) are important for early diagnosis and prognosis, and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of VALI. Currently identified biomarkers of VALI are key elements of the inflammatory and immune response pathways; however, the precise function of each mediator remains to be elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have validated the sensitivity or specificity of any biological markers that may aid early diagnosis or treatment of VALI (2, 3) . Further studies are required in order to identify novel, sensitive and specific biological markers."

Rapid discovery and optimization of therapeutic antibodies against emerging infectious diseases,"Using a comprehensive set of discovery and optimization tools, antibodies were produced with the ability to neutralize SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in Vero E6 cells and in animal models. These anti-SARS antibodies were discovered using a novel DNA display method, which can identify new antibodies within days. Once neutralizing antibodies were identified, a comprehensive and effective means of converting the mouse sequences to human frameworks was accomplished using HuFR TM (human framework reassembly) technology. The best variant (61G4) from this screen showed a 3.5 -4-fold improvement in neutralization of SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Finally, using a complete site-saturation mutagenesis methodology focused on the CDR (complementarity determining regions), a single point mutation (51E7) was identified that improved the 80% plaque reduction neutralization of the virus by greater than 8-fold. These discovery and evolution strategies can be applied to any emerging pathogen or toxin where a causative agent is known.","Emerging and re-emerging viruses that cause human diseases are becoming of greater concern for public health. A good example is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus, which first appeared in the human population in late 2002 and eventually infected $8000 people with a 10% fatality rate (WHO, 2003) . Today, the avian influenza H5N1 virus poses a significant threat if effective human -human transmission develops, with the potential risk of a Spanish flu-like pandemic (Juckett, 2006; Tellier, 2006 ; Thomas and Noppenberger, 2007) . The emergence of these viruses and other biothreat agents has raised world concerns for their use in biowarfare/bioterrorism and demonstrates the vulnerability of society to biological threats."
,"Background: On May 19, 2017, the cluster of 6 acute respiratory infections due to adenovirus in the swimming department of a physical education school (School J) was reported to Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the transmission route of the infection and to control the outbreak. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study (Study 1) was conducted on students and teachers of the athletic departments using the swimming pool, and a prospective surveillance (Study 2) was conducted on all students and teachers of the School J. A case was defined as any student and school personnel who developed more than two of the following symptoms from April 10 to July 2, 2017: fever, sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, or headache. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated to compare the attack rates according to potential risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for infection in the outbreak. Results: 47 cases were identified: 33 (55.9%) cases occurred among 59 students and teachers in Study 1 and 14 (3.9%) among 362 students and school personnel in Study 2. There were 18 laboratory confirmed adenovirus infection cases. The common symptoms were headache (71.7%), fever (69.6%), rhinorrhea (63.0%), sputum (56.5%), and sore throat (54.3%). 23.9% of the cases were accompanied with diarrhea and 19.6% with eye congestion. None of the cases developed pneumonia. 32.6% of the cases were hospitalized. In Study 1, attack rate in the swimming department was higher than that in others (RR: 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.60). In Study 2, being a member of the shooting department (RR: 20.70; 95% CI: 4.90 -87.47) and being a first year high school student (RR: 10.95; 95% CI: 2.90 -41.33) were identified as risk factors for the infections. Genetic analyses of the adenoviruses showed 100% identical sequence in homology and confirmed the human adenovirus B55 (HAdV-B55). No adenovirus was detected at examining the water and environment of the swimming pool and dormitory. Conclusion: The outbreak is inferred to be occurred via propagated transmission among the students in the same athletic department, while the students with symptoms of respiratory infection continued performing school activities without any restrictions. Infection control measures such as early detection of symptoms of respiratory infection and restriction of group activity are necessary to prevent respiratory infection outbreak in the communal living setting.","The adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus. It is divided into seven species by DNA homology and has more than 70 serotypes [1] . Depending on the serotype, HAdV causes various infectious diseases such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and epidemic conjunctivitis. The most common infection due to HAdV is pharyngitis [2, 3] . Mainly developed among children, most of them recover naturally. However some cases progress to severe respiratory infection such as pneumonia and cause death. The known types that cause severe respiratory infection among adults are types 3, 4, and 7, and types 14 and 55 have been reported as the cause of outbreaks [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Adenovirus is transmitted via respiratory droplets, fecal to oral routes, or contaminated environments, and rarely via swimming pool water [10, 11] . The incubation period of an acute respiratory infection by adenovirus is 2~14 days [2] . Adenovirus infection outbreak in swimming pool, the healthcare facilities, and military camps have been reported [5, [12] [13] [14] [15] . An oral vaccine has been introduced in the United States to prevent extensive epidemics of respiratory infections caused by types 4 and 7 in military camps [16] . In Korea, a severe case of adenovirus infection in a military camp, cases of pneumonia and consequent death caused by type 55 have been reported [17] [18] [19] [20] . But there has been no report of adenovirus respiratory infection outbreak in schools, education facilities, and private residential facilities in Korea. This study is the first report of the outbreak of acute respiratory infection caused by adenovirus, occurred on school in Korea."
Akihiro ASANO 3,"A scenario tree model was developed to propose efficient bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) control measures. The model used field data in eastern Hokkaido where the risk of BVDV infection in cattle has been reduced by an eradication program including mass vaccination, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing, herd screening tests using bulk milk, and outbreak investigations of newly infected herds. These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds. When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests. Considering the model outputs together, the scenario tree model developed in the present study was useful to compare the efficacy of the control measures for BVD.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. infection (TI) of BVDV in adult ruminants shows subclinical or non-severe symptoms [8, 25] ; however, BVDV viruses can be transmitted to the fetus in pregnant cattle during the 40-120 days of gestation, thereby inducing fetus immune tolerance to BVDV and resulting in the delivery of persistently infected (PI) calves [3, 9-10, 17, 22, 26] . The PI calves shed BVDVs through oculonasal discharge and other secretions throughout their lives, without showing apparent clinical manifestations except for fatal mucosal disease [7, 12] . It is commonly believed that PI cattle are the primary source of BVDV infection in a herd [17, 27] . Therefore, it is essential for the control of BVD that PI cattle are promptly detected and culled [1] ."
Anticancer compound ABT-263 accelerates apoptosis in virus-infected cells and imbalances cytokine production and lowers survival rates of infected mice,"ABT-263 and its structural analogues ABT-199 and ABT-737 inhibit B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), BCL2L1 long isoform (Bcl-xL) and BCL2L2 (Bcl-w) proteins and promote cancer cell death. Here, we show that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these small molecules accelerate the deaths of non-cancerous cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) or other viruses. In particular, we demonstrate that ABT-263 altered Bcl-xL interactions with Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats protein (UACA). ABT-263 thereby activated the caspase-9mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis pathway, which, together with the IAV-initiated caspase-8-mediated apoptosis pathway, triggered the deaths of IAV-infected cells. Our results also indicate that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense virus constituents to regulate cellular apoptosis. Importantly, premature killing of IAV-infected cells by ABT-263 attenuated the production of key pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. The imbalance in cytokine production was also observed in ABT-263-treated IAV-infected mice, which resulted in an inability of the immune system to clear the virus and eventually lowered the survival rates of infected animals. Thus, the results suggest that the chemical inhibition of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could potentially be hazardous for cancer patients with viral infections.","activates caspase-8. 4, 5 Active caspase-8 cleaves BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid). 6 Cleaved Bid facilitates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and accelerates cancer cell death. 7 Replication of several important human microbes, such as the influenza A virus (IAV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, coronavirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus depend on Bcl-2-, Bcl-xL-and Bcl-w-mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] In addition to mitochondria-initiated apoptosis, the replication of these microbes is associated with the caspase-8-FADD (FAS-associating death domain-containing protein)-mediated apoptosis pathway. 17 We hypothesised that the chemical inhibitors of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w could accelerate the death of virus-infected cells by enhancing caspase-mediated cross-talk between mitochondria and death receptor apoptosis pathways."
"Supplemental material for the paper ""Evidence of Translation Efficiency Adaptation of the Coding Regions of the Bacteriophage Lambda""",Israel. *Corresponding author (TT): tamirtul@post.tau.ac.il,"20min). We trimmed the poly-A adaptors from the reads using Cutadapt 2 (version 1.8. 3) , and utilized Bowtie 3 (version 1.1.1) to map them to the E. coli-lambda transcriptome. In the first phase, we discarded reads that mapped to rRNA and tRNA sequences with Bowtie parameters '-n 2 -seedlen 23 -k 1 --norc'. In the second phase, we mapped the remaining reads to the transcriptome with Bowtie parameters '-v 2 -a --strata --best -norc -m 200'. We attempted to extend alignments to their maximal length by comparing the polyA adaptor with the aligned transcript until reaching the maximal allowed error (2 mismatches across the read, with 3'-end mismatches avoided). We filtered out reads longer than 31-nt and shorter than 21-nt. Unique alignments were first assigned to the ribosome occupancy profiles. For multiple alignments, the best alignments in terms of number of mismatches were kept. Then, multiple aligned reads were distributed between locations according to the distribution of unique ribosomal reads in the respective surrounding regions. To this end, a 100-nt window was used to compute the read count density (total read counts in the window divided by length, based on unique reads) in vicinity of the M multiple aligned positions in the transcriptome, and the fraction of a read assigned to each position was . The location of the A-site was approximated by an 11nt shift from the 5' end of the aligned read. This shift maximized the correlation between MTDR (described below) and the observed read densities per E. coli gene."
Describing the Chinese HIV Surveillance System and the Influences of Political Structures and Social Stigma,"China's public health surveillance system for HIV was established in late 1980s and has evolved significantly during the past three decades. With the gradually changing mode of HIV transmission from sharing of intravenous injecting equipment to sexual exposure and the rapid spread of HIV infection among Chinese homosexual men in recent years, an efficient and comprehensive population-level surveillance system for describing epidemics trends and risk behaviours associated with HIV acquisition are essential for effective public health interventions for HIV. The current review describes the overall strength of the Chinese HIV surveillance system and its structural weaknesses from a political and social perspective. The HIV surveillance system in China has undergone substantial revamping leading to a comprehensive, timely and efficient reporting system. However, large data gaps and lack of quality control and sharing of information obstruct the full performance of the system. This is largely due to fragmented authoritarianism brought about by the underlying political structure. Social stigma and discrimination in health institutes are also key barriers for further improvements of HIV diagnosis and surveillance in China. © Zhang et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

This estimate was obtained by using the Workbook Method recommended by UNAIDS based on the numbers of newly diagnosed HIV cases and applying related mortality rates reported by the current HIV sentinel surveillance system. The overall national HIV prevalence is estimated to be 0.057% (0.042-0.071%) among the Chinese population [2, 3] . However, data from the national sentinel surveillance for HIV/AIDS indicated magnitudes and trends in HIV prevalence vary substantially across different at-risk populations: e.g. 0.6% HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSW) in 2009 [2] and increases from 1.4% in 2001 to 5.3% in 2009 among men who have sex with men (MSM) [4, 5] , and from 5.9% in 2002 to 9.3% in 2009 among injecting drug users (IDU) [2, 6] . The profile of HIV epidemics in China have also been gradually changing in mode of transmission. In the early 1990s, the main driver of HIV transmission was needle sharing among IDU [6] [7] [8] [9] ; however, sexual transmission has now become the primary mode of transmission in recent years [2, [10] [11] [12] . The proportion of newly diagnosed HIV cases due to sexual transmission increased from 49.8% in 2005 to 74.7% in 2009 and newly diagnosed cases attributed to homosexual contact has substantially increased from 12.2% in 2007 to 32.5% in 2009 [1, 10] ."
Ultra-Low-Dose Chest CT in Patients with Neutropenic Fever and Hematologic Malignancy: Image Quality and Its Diagnostic Performance,The aim of this study was to evaluate the image quality of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULDCT) and its diagnostic performance in making a specific diagnosis of pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancy.,"Immunocompromised patients with underlying hematologic malignancy are at increased risk of potentially fatal infection as a consequence of treatment-associated neutropenia [1] . The lungs are the most frequently involved organ for such infection [2] . According to a recent guideline established by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), chest radiograph is recommended for patients with respiratory signs and symptoms in order to rule out the presence of pneumonia [3] . The problem is that a chest radiograph frequently cannot depict the presence of lung abnormality at the early stage of pneumonia. Heussel et al. [4] demonstrated the presence of inflammatory pulmonary disease on computed tomography (CT) in more than 50% of febrile neutropenic patients who had normal chest radiographs. Hence, in daily practice, chest CT studies are recommended in patients with a risk for complicated pulmonary infection [5] ; consequently, the rates of chest CT + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + use have increased in febrile neutropenic patients [6] ."
Stimulation of stop codon readthrough: frequent presence of an extended 3 0 RNA structural element,"In Sindbis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and related alphaviruses, the polymerase is translated as a fusion with other non-structural proteins via readthrough of a UGA stop codon. Surprisingly, earlier work reported that the signal for efficient readthrough comprises a single cytidine residue 3 0 -adjacent to the UGA. However, analysis of variability at synonymous sites revealed strikingly enhanced conservation within the $150 nt 3 0 -adjacent to the UGA, and RNA folding algorithms revealed the potential for a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure in the same region. Mutational analysis of the predicted structure demonstrated that the stem-loop increases readthrough by up to 10-fold. The same computational analysis indicated that similar RNA structures are likely to be relevant to readthrough in certain plant virus genera, notably Furovirus, Pomovirus, Tobravirus, Pecluvirus and Benyvirus, as well as the Drosophilia gene kelch. These results suggest that 3 0 RNA stimulatory structures feature in a much larger proportion of readthrough cases than previously anticipated, and provide a new criterion for assessing the large number of cellular readthrough candidates that are currently being revealed by comparative sequence analysis.","There are two types of exceptions to universality of the genetic code. In one, the meaning of a codon is globally reassigned in a context independent manner (1) . In the other, codon redefinition is in competition with standard decoding and it is codon context dependent (2) . Though there is an example where the meaning of a sense codon is redefined (3) , most cases of codon redefinition involve one of the three stop codons of the standard code (UGA, UAG or UAA) specifying an amino acid at least a proportion of the time that it is decoded. Where the significant feature of stop codon redefinition is to allow ribosomes to continue translation into a downstream open reading frame (ORF), rather than the identity of the amino acid specified, then it is generally termed stop codon readthrough (RT) (4) . In contrast, when selenocysteine or pyrrolysine are specified by UGA or UAG, respectively, then the important features are the special properties of these non-universal amino acids (5) (6) (7) . Both types of non-global codon redefinition are just one aspect of the variety of ways (collectively referred to as 'recoding') in which genetic readout can be dynamically altered in a site-or mRNA-specific manner (8, 9) ."
A simple and safe antibody neutralization assay based on polio pseudoviruses,"The evaluation of the immunogenicity of Sabin strain based Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccines (sIPV) necessitates the use of wild strains in neutralization assays to assess the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies. The live virus strains including wild and Sabin strains must be handled in level 3 biocontainment laboratories. To develop an alternative assay without the use of a live virus, we constructed Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett pseudovirions by inserting luciferase reporter genes into intact capsid proteins. Afterward, we developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization test (pNT) and evaluated for the specificity and reproducibility. We tested serum samples from a clinical trial on sIPV vaccines by pNT and compared the results with those obtained from conventional neutralization tests (cNT). A strong correlation was observed between two methods, with the correlation coefficients of all three types of IPV vaccines being greater than 0.82 (p < 0.0001). The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) values obtained by pNT were approximately four times higher than that by cNT, revealing the better sensitivity of pNT. In conclusion, pNT is a safe, rapid and sensitive quantitative assay with the potential of being an alternative for the evaluation of the potency of polio vaccines.","Poliomyelitis, caused by poliovirus, is an acute infectious disease that may lead to the acute flaccid paralysis in children. An enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae, poliovirus has three serotypes. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is comprised of a single open reading frame flanked by a 5ʹUTR region and a 3ʹpoly(A) tail. After its entry into the host cell, the virus employs cellular mechanisms to translate the polyprotein. The polyprotein is initially cleaved by the viral proteases such as 2A pro and 3C pro into P1, P2, and P3 proteins, with P1 protein being further cleaved into VP1-VP4 capsid proteins, whereas P2 and P3 into functional proteins for viral replication and packaging. 1, 2 Live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV, made with attenuated strains) has served as the primary tool to eradicate polio worldwide. However, the vaccine has the potential to result in rare adverse cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), which have become the major concern. According to WHO report, the global annual burden of VAPP is estimated at about 500 cases and total 96 cases of cVDPV occurred in the world last year. 3, 4 Even in highincome countries with all inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV, made with wild strains) immunization schedule, VAPP risks remain; Foiadelli et al. reported the first VAPP case in an immunodeficient infant detected in Albania, which was later confirmed to be a Sabin-like strain in Italy. 5 Clearly, phasing out OPV vaccination eventually is currently on the agenda by the international community. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set the goal of global polio eradication by 2018. For those countries still using the live vaccines, the previous trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) was replaced by the bivalent vaccine (bOPV) in the routine immunization program, along with the introduction of at least one dose of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Given that wild type virus must be handled in level 3 biocontainment laboratories, WHO encourages the development of novel polio vaccines such as IPV based on the attenuated Sabin strains (sIPV). 11 The first sIPV combined with DTaP was approved in Japan in 2012. China approved the stand-alone sIPV the following year, with ongoing development in more manufacturers. 12 The traditional IPV is derived from the wild virus strains (wIPV), mostly Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett for type 1, 2 and 3. During clinical evaluation of sIPV vaccine, it is important to determine the cross-protection of the vaccine against the wild virus, which is achieved by carrying out a neutralizing assay using wild-type virus strains (wt virus). However, the wt virus-based neutralizing assay poses a challenge to most OPV vaccine producers, since they are routinely operating the attenuated Sabin strains. In addition to vaccine evaluation in clinical trials, the neutralization test needs to be used in the quality control of IPV, i.e. potency test of final vaccine bulks in rats. Clearly, the use of the wt virus not only presents safety issues to the operators but also potentially results in environmental contamination. Indeed, WHO recommends that tight biosafety measures be taken to prevent leakage of live poliovirus. 13 Therefore, it would be desirable to develop new assays in which no live wt virus would be used. 9 Pseudoviruses are virus-like particles which can replicate for one cycle and are, therefore, considered to have no or minimal biosafety concerns. In recent years, pseudoviruses have been used in place of some wt viruses in neutralizing assays which otherwise must be conducted in level-3 biocontainment laboratories. These viruses include SARS-CoV, H7N9, and MERS. [14] [15] [16] In this study, three pseudoviruses for wild Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett strains were constructed and used to develop a neutralization test in place of wt viruses. Here, we report that the new assay is superior to the traditional assays in terms of reproducibility and sensitivity; it could be a viable alternative neutralizing assay for potency analyses of polio vaccines."
Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.ae Active Targeted Drug Delivery for Microbes Using Nano-Carriers,"Although vaccines and antibiotics could kill or inhibit microbes, many infectious diseases remain difficult to treat because of acquired resistance and adverse side effects. Nano-carriers-based technology has made significant progress for a long time and is introducing a new paradigm in drug delivery. However, it still has some challenges like lack of specificity toward targeting the infectious site. Nanocarriers utilized targeting ligands on their surface called 'active target' provide the promising way to solve the problems like accelerating drug delivery to infectious areas and preventing toxicity or sideeffects. In this mini review, we demonstrate the recent studies using the active targeted strategy to kill or inhibit microbes. The four common nano-carriers (e.g. liposomes, nanoparticles, dendrimers and carbon nanotubes) delivering encapsulated drugs are introduced.","In modern life, human are always threaten by infectious diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Bacteria, virus and fungi are the critical reasons to infectious diseases [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Bacteria served many diseases by the food route [12] . In Germany, Escherichia coli in Fenugreek sprouts exported from Egypt caused 48 deaths from 2011 to 2012 [13] . Virus could cause various diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [14, 15] and influenza [16, 17] . Fungi like Cryptococcus neoformans could lead to chronic liver disease [18] . Luckily, with the development of safe vaccines and antibiotics, the infectious diseases seemed to be totally cured by these therapies [19] . However, there are some adverse drug effects if patients take these drugs at common dose or overdose such as insomnia [20] , osteoporosis [21] , headache [22] and liver failure [23] . Furthermore, these pathogens with a very fast doubling cycle develop a mechanism for becoming resistant to a specific drug at a glance [24] . In hence, scientists are trying to find new approachs to solve aforementioned problem urgently."
9-O -Acetylation of Sialomucins: A Novel Marker of Murine CD4 T Cells that Is Regulated during Maturation and Activation,"Terminal sialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates can carry 9-O -acetyl esters. For technical reasons, it has previously been difficult to determine their precise distribution on different cell types. Using a recombinant soluble form of the Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase as a probe for 9-O -acetylated sialic acids, we demonstrate here their preferential expression on the CD4 T cell lineage in normal B10.A mouse lymphoid organs. Of total thymocytes, 8-10% carry 9-O -acetylation; the great majority of these are the more mature PNA Ϫ , HSA Ϫ , and TCR hi medullary cells. While low levels of 9-O -acetylation are seen on some CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) and CD8 single positive (SP) cells, high levels are present primarily on 80-85% of CD4 SP cells. Correlation with CD4 and CD8 levels suggests that 9-O -acetylation appears as an early differentiation marker as cells mature from the DP to the CD4 SP phenotype. This high degree of 9-O -acetylation is also present on 90-95% of peripheral spleen and lymph node CD4 T cells. In contrast, only a small minority of CD8 T cells and B cells show such levels of 9-O -acetylation. Among mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes, the highly O -acetylated cells are Mel 14 hi , CD44 lo , and CD45R(exon B) hi , features typical of naive cells. Digestions with trypsin and O -sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) and ELISA studies of lipid extracts indicate that the 9-O -acetylated sialic acids on peripheral CD4 T cells are predominantly on O-linked mucintype glycoproteins and to a lesser degree, on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). In contrast, sialic acids on mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells are not O -acetylated; instead these molecules mask the recognition of O -acetylated gangliosides that seem to be present at similar levels as on CD4 cells. The 9-O -acetylated gangliosides on mouse T cells are not bound by CD60 antibodies, which recognize O -acetylated gangliosides in human T cells. Tethering 9-O -acetylated mucins with the Influenza C probe with or without secondary cross-linking did not cause activation of CD4 T cells. However, activation by other stimuli including TCR ligation is associated with a substantial decrease in surface 9-O -acetylation, primarily in the mucin glycoprotein component. Thus, 9-O -acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears on maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation.","S ialic acids (Sia) 1 are a family of 9-carbon negatively charged sugars usually found at terminal positions of mammalian cell surface sugar chains. Sias can be attached to underlying glycoconjugates in a variety of linkages, and modified in many different ways (1, 2) . These modifications were once thought to be rare, species-specific curiosities. However, recent evidence has shown that some modifications are more widely distributed than previously thought (2, 3) . For example, Sias often carry O -acetyl substitutions at the C-7 or C-9 positions (1-4). Since O -acetyl esters at C-7 position will spontaneously migrate to the C-9 position at physiologic extracellular pH (5, 6), 9-O -acetylated Sias predominate on cell surface glycoconjugates (7) . Identification of the cells and sialoglycoconjugates bearing 9-Oacetylation has been technically challenging, since these esters are often present on only a fraction of total sialic acids, and biochemical purification steps can be accompanied by varying losses of O -acetylation."
Vaccine or field strains: the jigsaw pattern of infectious bronchitis virus molecular epidemiology in Poland,"Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), account for severe economic losses in the poultry industry. The continuous emergence of a multitude of IBV variants poses many challenges for its diagnosis and control, and live attenuated vaccines, despite their routine use, still plays a significant role in driving IBV evolution, further complicating the epidemiological scenario. Unfortunately, the impact of different vaccination strategies on IB control, epidemiology, and diagnosis has rarely been investigated.","Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a worldwide distributed enveloped ssRNA+ virus that belongs to the species Avian coronavirus, genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. It is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), a highly contagious disease that affects the respiratory, reproductive, and renal systems of chickens of all ages and types (De Wit et al., 2011) ."
Hyponatraemia in cases of children with pneumonia,"Introduction: Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in clinical practice, and a common laboratory finding in children with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in cases of CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes. Material and methods: The medical files of 54 children (66.4% males), 4.67 ±2.88 years old, were retro-prospectively reviewed. Results: 35/54 (64.8%) children with pneumonia had normal values of sodium at admission, 18/54 (33.3%) had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.9%) moderate hyponatraemia. Increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission were correlated with lower values of sodium (z = -2.664, p = 0.007 and z = -1.705, p = 0.089 respectively). No differences were found between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of sodium in serum at admission. A correlation was found between sodium admission values and: a) C-reactive protein (p = 0.000), and b) leukocyte count (p = 0.006). Sedimentation rate (p = 0.021) was also considered as a possible risk factor affecting the value of sodium at admission to hospital. Finally, a negative association was also observed between the degree of hyponatraemia and the duration of hospitalization (z = -3.398, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Although studies in larger population groups are needed, in our study increased heart rhythm, tachypnoea, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, and also erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be considered as possible risk factors influencing the degree of hyponatraemia, and thus the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP.","Hyponatraemia (HN, serum sodium < 135 mEq/l) is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in clinical practice, and also in critically ill children [1] . It is present in approximately 3% of hospitalized patients [2] . Mild to moderate HN and severe hyponatraemia are found in 15-30% and 1-4% of hospitalized patients, respectively [3] ."
Characterization of novel monoclonal antibodies against MERS-coronavirus spike protein,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe pulmonary infection, with ∼35 % mortality. Spike glycoprotein (S) of MERS-CoV is a key target for vaccines and therapeutics because S mediates viral entry and membrane-fusion to host cells. Here, four different S subunit proteins, receptor-binding domain (RBD; 358-606 aa), S1 (1-751 aa), S2 (752-1296 aa), and SΔTM (1-1296 aa), were generated using the baculoviral system and immunized in mice to develop neutralizing antibodies. We developed 77 hybridomas and selected five neutralizing mAbs by immunization with SΔTM against MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain S-pseudotyped lentivirus. However, all five monoclonal antibodies (mAb) did not neutralize the pseudotyped V534A mutation. Additionally, one mAb RBD-14F8 did not show neutralizing activity against pseudoviruses with amino acid substitution of L506 F or D509 G (England1 strain, EMC/2012 L506 F, and EMC/2012 D509 G), and RBD-43E4 mAb could not neutralize the pseudotyped I529 T mutation, while three other neutralizing mAbs showed broad neutralizing activity. This implies that the mutation in residue 506-509, 529, and 534 of S is critical to generate neutralization escape variants of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, all five neutralizing mAbs have binding affinity to RBD, although most mAbs generated by RBD did not have neutralizing activity. Additionally, chimeric antibodies of RBD-14F8 and RBD-43E4 with human Fc and light chain showed neutralizing effect against wild type MERS-CoV KOR/KNIH/002, similar to the original mouse mAbs. Thus, our mAbs can be utilized for the identification of specific mutations of MERS-CoV.","Korean patients were isolated, and 12 of these genomes were identified to possess a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein (Kim et al., 2016a, b; Min et al., 2016) . Specifically, 11 of these genomes showed an I529 T mutation in RBD, and 1 showed a D510 G mutation, which exhibits reduced affinity of RBD to its cellular receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26), compared with the wild type RBD, suggesting that MERS-CoV adaptation during human-to-human spread may be driven to escape from neutralizing antibodies, rather than to evolve for a stronger affinity to DPP4 (Kim et al., 2016b; Park et al., 2016) . Therefore, several mAbs against different epitopes within S might be used as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent to avoid the immune escape of the virus."
CVTree update: a newly designed phylogenetic study platform using composition vectors and whole genomes,"The CVTree web server (http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/ cvtree) presented here is a new implementation of the whole genome-based, alignment-free composition vector (CV) method for phylogenetic analysis. It is more efficient and user-friendly than the previously published version in the 2004 web server issue of Nucleic Acids Research. The development of whole genome-based alignment-free CV method has provided an independent verification to the traditional phylogenetic analysis based on a single gene or a few genes. This new implementation attempts to meet the challenge of ever increasing amount of genome data and includes in its database more than 850 prokaryotic genomes which will be updated monthly from NCBI, and more than 80 fungal genomes collected manually from several sequencing centers. This new CVTree web server provides a faster and stable research platform. Users can upload their own sequences to find their phylogenetic position among genomes selected from the server's inbuilt database. All sequence data used in a session may be downloaded as a compressed file. In addition to standard phylogenetic trees, users can also choose to output trees whose monophyletic branches are collapsed to various taxonomic levels. This feature is particularly useful for comparing phylogeny with taxonomy when dealing with thousands of genomes.","Traditional molecular phylogeny makes use of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequences or a few orthologous proteins. Some more recent phylogenomic studies are based on concatenation of a larger number of proteins. The ever burgeoning genome sequencing projects worldwide have prompted several whole-genome phylogenetic approaches. However, most-if not all-rely on sequence alignment at some stage and therefore depend on many parameters, such as the use of scoring matrices. As modern prokaryotic and fungal taxonomy depends more and more on the traditional phylogeny, there is an urgent need to develop alternative approaches."
Mechanisms of Accountability for the Realization of the Right to Health in China,"China ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2001. It thus bears obligations under Article 12 of the covenant to take appropriate measures at the domestic level to realize the right to health in China. Accountability is an important component of the right to health. This article examines whether the Western concept of accountability, recently imported into China, has the potential to improve the protection of the right to health within China's existing political, legal, and cultural framework. In so doing, it reviews current Chinese institutional mechanisms and considers the use of less formal mechanisms by which duty-bearers might be held accountable in China. More specifically, this article provides an overview of a range of health-related accountability mechanisms, including judicial, political, administrative, professional, and social accountability arrangements. It concludes that although there is the basis of an accountability framework for the right to health in China, the effective operation of accountability mechanisms is hindered by longstanding cultural and political barriers.","On August 23, 2016, Philip Alston, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, issued a statement at the end of his mission in China. Alston noted the extraordinary progress that China has made over the past three decades in bringing people out of poverty. In particular, he reported that ""[i]n 2003, only 10% of the population had health insurance"" whereas "" [b] y 2013, some 95% were covered, including most of the rural poor and vulnerable urban groups."" 1 Additionally, between 2000 and 2012, the infant mortality rate fell by 60% and the maternal mortality rate fell by 49%, and between 1990 and 2012, life expectancy increased from 69 to 75 years. Alston, accordingly, concluded that there were lessons for other countries to be drawn from China's achievements. Significantly, he declared that ""genuine political will to alleviate poverty is arguably the most important ingredient of all."" 2 On the other hand, Alston reported a number of challenges for economic and social rights, in particular the lack of genuine accountability mechanisms to enable rights-holders to seek remedies for violations of their human rights. The absence of ""effective options for seeking redress or letting steam off,"" he noted, often leads to violence both by and against petitioners and protesters. 3 Accordingly, the development of effective domestic mechanisms of accountability in China is a crucial issue. In this context, this article provides an overview of accountability mechanisms in China, focusing on the right to health specifically and revealing where such mechanisms are lacking and how they might be improved. Accountability may involve a broad range of mechanisms-such as litigation, elections, public hearings, town meetings, professional oversight, social actions, and media reports-and China is a large and complex country. The article, therefore, does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review and does not examine any particular mechanism in depth. Nonetheless, the overview and analysis have implications for accountability for the right to health and all economic and social rights in China."
"Toxocariasis After Slug Ingestion Characterized by Severe Neurologic, Ocular, and Pulmonary Involvement BRIEF REPORT • OFID • 1 4","Human toxocariasis is generally a benign, self-curing disease, and neurologic involvement is quite exceptional. In this study, we report a case of toxocariasis caused by ingestion of an unusual transport host, namely live slugs. The clinical picture comprised eosinophilic lung involvement with severe neurologic disorders in relation to vasculitis as well as retinal detachment.","Human toxocariasis is a worldwide helminthozoonosis related to the infection of humans by larvae of Toxocara spp, the common roundworm of canids and felids. Patients are infected upon ingestion of embryonated eggs present in contaminated soil or on green vegetables, such as those found in salads, or more rarely viable larvae contained in the flesh of avian or mammalian paratenic hosts [1, 2] , which sometimes were unusual [3] . Young age, geophagia or pica, contact with puppies, poor socioeconomic level, and residence in rural areas are recognized risk factors [4] . Toxocariasis elicits various syndromes that are currently characterized as generalized (visceral larva migrans and covert toxocariasis) and compartmentalized as well as ocular and neurologic. Covert toxocariasis, which represents the majority of the cases, is typically a self-curing, benign disease [2] . Ocular toxocariasis primarily occurs in toddlers and teenagers and often results in a permanent vision loss in the concerned eye [5, 6] . Neurologic forms are constantly severe but are rarely observed, at least in Westernized countries [7, 8] ."
"Inhibition of translation by IFIT family members is determined by their ability to interact selectively with the 5 0 -terminal regions of cap0-, cap1-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs","Ribosomal recruitment of cellular mRNAs depends on binding of eIF4F to the mRNA's 5 0 -terminal 'cap'. The minimal 'cap0' consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5 0 -5 0 triphosphate (ppp) bridge. Cap0 is further modified by 2 0 -O-methylation of the next two riboses, yielding 'cap1' (m7GpppNmN) and 'cap2' (m7GpppNmNm). However, some viral RNAs lack 2 0 -O-methylation, whereas others contain only ppp-at their 5 0 -end. Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed effectors of innate immunity that inhibit viral replication by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we investigated the ability of IFIT family members to interact with cap1-, cap0-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs and inhibit their translation. IFIT1 and IFIT1B showed very high affinity to cap-proximal regions of cap0-mRNAs (K 1/2,app $9 to 23 nM). The 2 0 -O-methylation abrogated IFIT1/mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap1-mRNA, albeit with reduced affinity (K 1/2,app $450 nM). The 5 0 -terminal regions of 5 0 ppp-mRNAs were recognized by IFIT5 (K 1/2,app $400 nM). The activity of individual IFITs in inhibiting initiation on a specific mRNA was determined by their ability to interact with its 5 0 -terminal region: IFIT1 and IFIT1B efficiently outcompeted eIF4F and abrogated initiation on cap0-mRNAs, whereas inhibition on cap1-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs by IFIT1B and IFIT5 was weaker and required higher protein concentrations.","The innate immune system initiates defensive responses to infecting viruses and bacteria by recognition of 'pathogen associated molecular patterns' (PAMPs) as 'non-self' signatures. Recognition is mediated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-Ilike receptors (1) . PAMPs specific to viral mRNAs include the double-stranded nature of RNA replicative intermediates, the absence of modified nucleosides (such as N 6methyladenosine) and single-stranded adenosine/uridine (AU)-rich regions (1) . The 5 0 -termini of some viral mRNAs also differ from those of cellular mRNAs. The mRNA cap consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5 0 -5 0 ppp bridge: in the minimal RNA cap structure, named 'cap0', methylation is restricted to the N7 position of the guanine base, but in higher eukaryotes, additional methylation occurs at the 2 0 -position of riboses of the next two nucleotides, yielding the 2 0 -Omethylated 'cap1' (m 7 GpppNmN) and 'cap2' (m 7 GpppNmNm) ( Figure 1A ). Although many viral mRNAs are also capped and 2 0 -O-methylated (2), the genomic and antigenomic RNAs of negative-stranded RNA viruses such as influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae) instead have a 5 0 -terminal ppp (3) , whereas the genomic and subgenomic mRNAs of Sindbis virus (family Togaviridae) are capped but lack 2 0 -O-methylation (4, 5) . Nucleic acid recognition by PRRs activates signaling cascades that trigger the expression of Type 1 interferons (IFN) (6) . IFN secretion spreads the defensive response to neighboring cells by binding to IFN receptors, which activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to strong transcriptional induction of >300 genes (7) . The IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat (IFIT) genes are among the Full length +6-8 nt most strongly induced by IFN treatment (e.g. 8, 9) , for example leading to the cytoplasmic accumulation of >1 Â 10 6 IFIT1 molecules per cell (10) . Their abundance would be consistent with IFIT proteins having an executive function rather than a signaling role in innate immunity. The IFIT family arose by gene duplication and is conserved in vertebrates (11) (12) (13) . Most mammals encode IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, with the exception of mice and rats (which lack IFIT5) and horses (which lack IFIT1), but many species also have additional IFIT-like genes, encoding IFIT1B (in humans, mice and rabbits), IFIT1C (in mice), IFIT3B (in dogs and mice) and IFIT5-like proteins (in dogs and rabbits). IFIT proteins have molecular weights ranging between 47 and 72 kDa, and contain up to 11 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs (14) that form a series of tandem antiparallel a-helices extending over their entire length. The regular repeating relationship between TPRs is disrupted by two insertions in IFIT2 and IFIT5, so that the TPRs form three distinct subdomains producing a V-shaped clamplike structure (15) (16) (17) (18) . The concave surface of subdomain II, the 'pivot' helices between subdomains II and III and the N-terminal TPRs of subdomain III form a deep cylindrical cavity that is lined with positively charged residues (16) (17) (18) . Whereas IFIT5 is a monomer, IFIT2 forms a domain-swapped homodimer in a manner that may account for conformational switching of subdomains during binding of ligands (15) and for homo-and heterodimerization of human IFITs 1, 1B, 2 and 3 (10, 18) . The functional importance of homo-and heterodimerization of IFITs is unknown."
"Constitutive and Basal Secretion from the Endocrine Cell Line, AtT-20","A variant of the ACTH-secreting pituitary cell line, AtT-20, has been isolated that does not make ACTH, sulfated proteins characteristic of the regulated secretory pathway, or dense-core secretory granules but retains constitutive secretion. Unlike wild type AtT-20 cells, the variant cannot store or release on stimulation, free glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In addition, the variant cells cannot store trypsinogen or proinsulin, proteins that are targeted to dense core secretory granules in wild type cells. The regulated pathway could not be restored by transfecting with DNA encoding trypsinogen, a soluble regulated secretory protein targeted to secretory granules. A comparison of secretion from variant and wild type cells allows a distinction to be made between constitutive secretion and basal secretion, the spontaneous release of regulated proteins that occurs in the absence of stimulation.","I s cells that have specialized regulated secretory vesicles, called secretory granules, sorting of the regulated secretory products away from constitutively secreted products and from lysosomal enzymes occurs in the trans-Golgi network (Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Tooze et al., 1987; Orci et al., 1987) . The concentrated contents of the secretory granules are released from cells in response to external signals, whereas no signals are required for constitutive secretion. The mechanism of protein sorting between these two secretory pathways is not known; both a hormonespecific receptor mechanism (Chung et al., 1989) and selective condensation of secretory granule contents (Kelly, 1985; Gerdes et al., 1989) have been proposed."
"Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series","OBJECTIVE To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019). DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection.","In December 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which had previously not been detected in humans or animals. 1 Epidemiological evidence suggested that most of these patients had visited a local seafood market in Wuhan 2 and that the gene sequence of the virus obtained from these patients was highly similar to that identified in bats. 3 The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-Cov-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), with which it shares more than 79% of its sequence, but it is more distant to the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), a member of the Merbecovirus subgenus (only 50% homology with SARS-Cov-2). All these viruses are categorised within the same genus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae. [4] [5] [6] [7] Some researchers have found that SARS-Cov-2 has strong affinity to human respiratory receptors, 8 suggesting a potential threat to global public health."
Viral Polymerase-Helicase Complexes Regulate Replication Fidelity To Overcome Intracellular Nucleotide Depletion,"To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions.","R NA viruses rapidly generate large amounts of genetic diversity, all while maintaining genomic integrity, processes which have thus far been essentially restricted to the function of the polymerase. Little is known regarding other viral or cellular components that might regulate fidelity, and in particular those involved in alphavirus replication. By using RNA mutagens to alter mutation rates, the fidelity determinants within the viral polymerase of many RNA viruses have been identified, including footand-mouth disease virus (1, 2) , poliovirus (3, 4) , Coxsackie B virus (5, 6) , influenza A virus (7) , human enterovirus 71 (8, 9) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (10, 11) , and Sindbis virus (SINV) (11) . Mutagenic compounds such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil are base analogs that provoke mutations in downstream replication cycles after they are misincorporated into the genome. However, ribavirin also functions as an IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, an enzyme necessary for de novo purine biosynthesis and more specifically intracellular GTP levels (12) (13) (14) (15) , whereas 5-fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase, leading to decreases in dTTP and increases in dUTP (16) and thus another imbalance in nucleotide pools. Thus, in addition to avoiding the incorporation of mutagenic base analogs, resistance may arise to overcome imbalances in nucleotide pools. How such resistance could be achieved and whether such variants would present altered fidelity is not known."

Characterizing and controlling the inflammatory network during influenza A virus infection,"To gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza A virus (IAV) infections, this study focused on characterizing the inflammatory network and identifying key proteins by combining high-throughput data and computational techniques. We constructed the cell-specific normal and inflammatory networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections through integrating high-throughput data. We demonstrated that better discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks by network entropy than by other topological metrics. Moreover, we identified different dynamical interactions among TLR2, IL-1b, IL10 and NFkB between normal and inflammatory networks using optimization algorithm. In particular, good robustness and multistability of inflammatory sub-networks were discovered. Furthermore, we identified a complex, TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, which may play important roles in controlling inflammation, and demonstrated that changes in network entropy of this complex negatively correlated to those of three proteins: TNFa, NFkB and COX-2. These findings provide significant hypotheses for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases and developing control strategies.","I nfluenza A virus (IAV) is an important human pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections, and these infections are a worldwide public health [1] [2] [3] . Inflammation is a hallmark of many serious human infectious diseases caused by a wide variety of viruses [4] [5] [6] . Numerous studies have demonstrated that IAV infections can trigger severe inflammatory diseases [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, investigating molecular mechanisms of the inflammatory responses resulting from an IAV infection is of great significance in controlling the appearance of complications and reducing the associated tissue damage 7, 9 . However, many biological experiments have shown that IAV infection-induced inflammatory responses are extremely complex and regulated by a complicated network [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, elucidating the network properties that distinguish inflammatory disease from the normal cellular state has critical importance for gaining systems-level insights into the pathogenesis of IAV infections and ultimately for developing novel therapeutic strategies."

The pathogen of this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name on February 11, 2020 for the epidemic disease: Corona Virus Disease . To date, COVID-19 has affected people in more than 28 countries/regions, including Taiwan, and has become a global threat.

Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease (ARD), and pneumonia."
Envelope Glycoprotein Interactions in Coronavirus Assembly,"Coronaviruses are assembled by budding into smooth membranes of the intermediate ERto-Golgi compartment. We have studied the association of the viral membrane glycoproteins M and S in the formation of the virion envelope. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis we demonstrated that the M and S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) interact specifically forming heteromultimeric complexes in infected cells. These could be detected only when the detergents used for their solubilization from cells or virions were carefully chosen: a combination of nonionic (NP-40) and ionic (deoxycholic acid) detergents proved to be optimal. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that newly made M and S proteins engaged in complex formation with different kinetics. Whereas the M protein appeared in complexes immediately after its synthesis, newly synthesized S protein did so only after a lag phase of >20 min. Newly made M was incorporated into virus particles faster than S, which suggests that it associates with preexisting S molecules. Using the vaccinia virus T7-driven coexpression of M and S we also demonstrate formation of M/S complexes in the absence of other coronaviral proteins. Pulse-chase labelings and coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that","M and S associate in pre-Golgi membranes because the unglycosylated form of M appeared in M/S complexes rapidly. Since no association of M and S was detected when protein export from the ER was blocked by brefeldin A, stable complexes most likely arise in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment. Sucrose velocity gradient analysis showed the M/S complexes to be heterogeneous and of higher order, suggesting that they are maintained by homo-and heterotypic interactions. M/S complexes colocalized with a-mannosidase II, a resident Golgi protein. They acquired Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications but were not detected at the cell surface. Thus, the S protein, which on itself was transported to the plasma membrane, was retained in the Golgi complex by its association with the M protein. Because coronaviruses bud at pre-Golgi membranes, this result implies that the envelope glycoprotein complexes do not determine the site of budding. Yet, the self-association of the MHV envelope glycoproteins into higher order complexes is indicative of its role in the sorting of the viral membrane proteins and in driving the formation of the viral lipoprotein coat in virus assembly."

Rfam: updates to the RNA families database,"Rfam is a collection of RNA sequence families, represented by multiple sequence alignments and covariance models (CMs). The primary aim of Rfam is to annotate new members of known RNA families on nucleotide sequences, particularly complete genomes, using sensitive BLAST filters in combination with CMs. A minority of families with a very broad taxonomic range (e.g. tRNA and rRNA) provide the majority of the sequence annotations, whilst the majority of Rfam families (e.g. snoRNAs and miRNAs) have a limited taxonomic range and provide a limited number of annotations. Recent improvements to the website, methodologies and data used by Rfam are discussed. Rfam is freely available on the Web at","Rfam is a database of sequence families of structural RNAs, including non-coding RNA genes as well as cisregulatory RNA elements. Rfam release 9.0 contains 603 families, each represented by a multiple sequence alignment of known and predicted representative members of the family, annotated with a consensus base-paired secondary structure. This so-called SEED alignment is used to build a covariance model (CM) with the Infernal software (1) . Each Rfam covariance model is searched against a nucleotide sequence database, producing a list of putative hits. Matches that score above a curated threshold are then aligned to the CM to produce a so-called FULL alignment. This process is outlined diagrammatically in Figure 1 . The Rfam database was developed as a generic approach to the annotation of structured RNA families on genomic sequences (2, 3) , but it has been widely used as a source of reliable alignments and structures for the purposes of training and benchmarking RNA sequence and secondary structure analysis software."
Global patterns in coronavirus diversity,"Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence.","In 2002/3, SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in the Guangdong province of southern China (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003) . It quickly spread to twenty-seven countries, infecting 8,098 people with 774 deaths, and was declared the first global pandemic of the 21st century. Bats were identified as the reservoir (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005 ) and probable source (Ge et al. 2013 ) of the outbreak. In 2012, the SARS pandemic was followed by MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East (Zaki et al. 2012 ) with 1,782 confirmed human cases and 640 deaths (as of September 2016). Camels were identified as the likely source of human infections (Reusken et al. 2013; Azhar et al. 2014) ; however, bats were again found to host closely related (MERS-like) viruses and are therefore assumed to be the original evolutionary source (Woo et al. 2006; Anthony et al. 2012; Corman et al. 2014a,b; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2015; Anthony et al. 2017) ."
Avoiding student infection during a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak: a single medical school experience,"Purpose: In outbreaks of infectious disease, medical students are easily overlooked in the management of healthcare personnel protection although they serve in clinical clerkships in hospitals. In the early summer of 2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) struck South Korea, and students of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine (SKKUSOM) were at risk of contracting the disease. The purpose of this report is to share SKKUSOM's experience against the MERS outbreak and provide suggestions for medical schools to consider in the face of similar challenges. Methods: Through a process of reflection-on-action, we examined SKKUSOM's efforts to avoid student infection during the MERS outbreak and derived a few practical guidelines that medical schools can adopt to ensure student safety in outbreaks of infectious disease. Results: The school leadership conducted ongoing risk assessment and developed contingency plans to balance student safety and continuity in medical education. They rearranged the clerkships to another hospital and offered distant lectures and tutorials. Five suggestions are extracted for medical schools to consider in infection outbreaks: instant cessation of clinical clerkships; rational decision making on a school closure; use of information technology; constant communication with hospitals; and open communication with faculty, staff, and students. Conclusion: Medical schools need to take the initiative and actively seek countermeasures against student infection. It is essential that medical schools keep constant communication with their index hospitals and the involved personnel. In order to assure student learning, medical schools may consider offering distant education with online technology.","In outbreaks of infectious disease, healthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of contracting emerging infections in the process of patient care [1, 2] ."
Improved Algorithmic Complexity for the 3SEQ Recombination Detection Algorithm,"Identifying recombinant sequences in an era of large genomic databases is challenging as it requires an efficient algorithm to identify candidate recombinants and parents, as well as appropriate statistical methods to correct for the large number of comparisons performed. In 2007, a computation was introduced for an exact nonparametric mosaicism statistic that gave high-precision P values for putative recombinants. This exact computation meant that multiplecomparisons corrected P values also had high precision, which is crucial when performing millions or billions of tests in large databases. Here, we introduce an improvement to the algorithmic complexity of this computation from O(mn 3 ) to O(mn 2 ), where m and n are the numbers of recombination-informative sites in the candidate recombinant. This new computation allows for recombination analysis to be performed in alignments with thousands of polymorphic sites. Benchmark runs are presented on viral genome sequence alignments, new features are introduced, and applications outside recombination analysis are discussed.","Determining whether genomic regions are undergoing homologous recombination is important in all parts of biology and genetics. Indeed, recombination has profound consequences for a population's evolutionary trajectory, and it changes our understanding of the evolutionary history of a population as described through phylogenetics (Schierup and Hein 2000; . Identifying recombination is especially important in large genomic analyses, as the larger the region being analyzed the higher the chance that recombination will be detected even in a small sample. Over the past three decades, methods of identifying recombination from sequence data have focused on detection of clustered polymorphism, excessive homoplasy, low linkage disequilibrium, mosaicism, and incongruent phylogenies . Some of these statistical signals have advantages over others in terms of false positive rate, statistical power, speed, and the size of the data set that can be analyzed. An analysis of sensitivity and specificity can be found in Posada and Crandall (Posada and Crandall 2001) and a guide to choosing an appropriate method for a given data set can be found in Martin et al. (2011) ."

,"ultraviolet (uV) radiation induces skin injury, and is associated with the development and formation of melanoma, which is a highly lethal form of skin cancer. juglanin is a natural product, which is predominantly extracted from Polygonum aviculare, and is considered a functional component among its various compounds. juglanin has been reported to exert marked protective effects in various diseases via the inhibition of inflammation and tumor cell growth. the present study aimed to explore the effects of juglanin on human skin cancer induced by uV and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism. in the present study, immunohistochemical analysis, western blot analysis, RT-qPCR analysis and flow cytometry assays were mainly used in vivo and/or in vitro. the results indicated that in mice, uVB exposure increased susceptibility to carcinogens, and accelerated disease pathogenesis. conversely, juglanin was able to ameliorate this condition via inhibition of inflammation, suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis via p38/c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnK) blockage, nuclear factor (nf)-κB inactivation and caspase stimulation in vivo. in addition, in vitro, the present study demonstrated that treatment of uVB-stimulated B16f10 melanoma cells with juglanin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, as well as increased apoptosis via the upregulation of caspase expression and poly (adP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. in addition, juglanin markedly attenuated p38/jnK signaling, inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway and suppressed uVB-induced nf-κB activation. taken together, these results indicated the possibility of applying juglanin in combination with uVB as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing skin cancer.","Skin cancer, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers (nmScs), including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is considered one of the most prevalent health concerns worldwide. approximately 132,000 cases of melanoma and 2-3 million cases of nmSc are reported per annum globally (1, 2) . extensive exposure to sunlight has been closely associated with skin cancer (3) , and the formation of skin cancer has been reported to be associated with one or numerous signaling pathways (4) .

Tanshinone IIA Attenuates Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis via Modulating Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme 2/ Angiotensin-(1-7) Axis in Rats,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a common complication in those interstitial lung diseases patients, which will result in poor prognosis and short survival. Traditional therapeutic methods such as glucocorticoid and cytotoxic drugs are insufficient for treating PF and may cause severe side effects. Recent studies showed that traditional Chinese herbal abstraction such as Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) was displayed significant anti-PF effects in animal models. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the protective effects of TIIA were not fully understood. Here we further investigated the protective effects of TIIA and its mechanisms underlying. PF models of rat were induced by bleomycin (BLM); TIIA was administered subsequently. The PF changes were identified by histopathological analyses. The results showed that BLM resulted in severe PF and alveolar inflammation; together with significant elevation of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β1). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) together with angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)] were both greatly reduced after BLM administration. TIIA treatment notably attenuated BLM induced PF and inflammation, decreased expression of TGF-β1 and reversed ACE-2 and ANG-(1-7) production in rat lungs. Thus we may draw the conclusion that TIIA may exert protective effects on BLM induced PF in rats, and the ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) axis may ascribe to those protective effects.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease which is characterized by rapidly progressive scarring of the lung tissue, together with exacerbated fibroblast proliferation, excessive accumulation of matrix proteins, and destruction of alveolar structure [1, 2] .

Ball Python Nidovirus: a Candidate Etiologic Agent for Severe Respiratory Disease in Python regius,"A severe, sometimes fatal respiratory disease has been observed in captive ball pythons (Python regius) since the late 1990s. In order to better understand this disease and its etiology, we collected case and control samples and performed pathological and diagnostic analyses. Electron micrographs revealed filamentous virus-like particles in lung epithelial cells of sick animals. Diagnostic testing for known pathogens did not identify an etiologic agent, so unbiased metagenomic sequencing was performed. Abundant nidovirus-like sequences were identified in cases and were used to assemble the genome of a previously unknown virus in the order Nidovirales. The nidoviruses, which were not previously known to infect nonavian reptiles, are a diverse order that includes important human and veterinary pathogens. The presence of the viral RNA was confirmed in all diseased animals (n ‫؍‬ 8) but was not detected in healthy pythons or other snakes (n ‫؍‬ 57). Viral RNA levels were generally highest in the lung and other respiratory tract tissues. The 33.5-kb viral genome is the largest RNA genome yet described and shares canonical characteristics with other nidovirus genomes, although several features distinguish this from related viruses. This virus, which we named ball python nidovirus (BPNV), will likely establish a new genus in Torovirinae subfamily. The identification of a novel nidovirus in reptiles contributes to our understanding of the biology and evolution of related viruses, and its association with lung disease in pythons is a promising step toward elucidating an etiology for this long-standing veterinary disease. IMPORTANCE Ball pythons are popular pets because of their diverse coloration, generally nonaggressive behavior, and relatively small size. Since the 1990s, veterinarians have been aware of an infectious respiratory disease of unknown cause in ball pythons that can be fatal. We used unbiased shotgun sequencing to discover a novel virus in the order Nidovirales that was present in cases but not controls. While nidoviruses are known to infect a variety of animals, this is the first report of a nidovirus recovered from any reptile. This report will enable diagnostics that will assist in determining the role of this virus in the causation of disease, which would allow control of the disease in zoos and private collections. Given its evolutionary divergence from known nidoviruses and its unique host, the study of reptile nidoviruses may further our understanding of related diseases and the viruses that cause them in humans and other animals.

Statins may decrease the fatality rate of Middle East respiratory syndrome infection. mBio 6(4):e01120-15.,"T he recent paper by Totura and colleagues (1) revealed that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling contributes to a protective innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Despite the importance of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) as public health threats, there are currently no drugs available to treat these coronaviruses, with current evidence suggesting that the antiviral drugs ribavirin and interferon (IFN) are only slightly efficacious in ameliorating SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections (2) . Now human-to-human infections of MERS-CoV are more frequently reported, with a total case fatality rate of 37.7% (2). Therefore, a feasible but effective treatment is needed urgently, especially treatment with FDA-approved drugs, including some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs."
The infection of primary avian tracheal epithelial cells with infectious bronchitis virus,"Here we introduce a culture system for the isolation, passaging and amplification of avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cells. The ATE medium, which contains chicken embryo extract and fetal bovine serum, supports the growth of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells from chicken tracheas on fibronectin-or matrigel-coated dishes. Non-epithelial cells make up less than 10% of the total population. We further show that ATE cells support the replication and spread of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Interestingly, immunocytostaining revealed that basal cells are resistant to IBV infection. We also demonstrate that glycosaminoglycan had no effect on infection of the cells by IBV. Taken together, these findings suggest that primary ATE cells provide a novel cell culture system for the amplification of IBV and the in vitro characterization of viral cytopathogenesis.",Embryonated egg inoculation is commonly used to amplify avian RNA viruses. Successful viral replication mainly depends upon viral adaption to and replication in the cells of the embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Growth retardation and malformation of the embryo are the main indicators of viral reproduction in this system and signal the proper period for harvesting the amplified virions from the amniotic or chorioallantoic fluids.
Integrated Cross-Species Analysis Identifies a Conserved Transitional Dendritic Cell Population HHS Public Access,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are sensor cells with diverse immune functions, from type I interferon (IFN-I) production to antigen presentation, T cell activation, and tolerance. Regulation of these functions remains poorly understood but could be mediated by functionally specialized pDC subpopulations. We address pDC diversity using a high-dimensional single-cell approach: mass cytometry (CyTOF). Our analysis uncovers a murine pDC-like population that specializes in antigen presentation with limited capacity for IFN-I production. Using a multifaceted crossspecies comparison, we show that this pDC-like population is the definitive murine equivalent of the recently described human AXL + DCs, which we unify under the name transitional DCs (tDCs) given their continuum of pDC and cDC2 characteristics. tDCs share developmental traits with pDCs, as well as recruitment dynamics during viral infection. Altogether, we provide a framework for deciphering the function of pDCs and tDCs during diseases, which has the potential to open new avenues for therapeutic design.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998) . In both mouse and human, DCs are divided into functionally specialized subpopulations, i.e., plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and two subsets of classical DCs (cDCs), cDC1 and cDC2 (Guilliams et al., 2014; Merad et al., 2013) . pDCs are quite distinct from their cDC counterparts. Ontologically, pDCs differentiate from both myeloid and lymphoid precursors but display lymphoid features regardless of their developmental path (Corcoran et al., 2003; Naik et al., 2007; Onai et al., 2007; Sathe et al., 2013; Shigematsu et al., 2004) . Functionally, while cDC1s and cDC2s are specialized for interaction with T cells, pDCs are well known for their innate capacity to rapidly produce large quantities of type I interferon (IFNα and IFNβ, abbreviated IFN-I) upon viral encounter (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001; Siegal et al., 1999) . However, aside from their innate role, pDCs can carry out adaptive immune functions upon activation, i.e., antigen presentation, T cell activation, and tolerance (Alculumbre et al., 2019; Leylek and Idoyaga, 2019) . This represents a rare phenomenon in the immune system, in which one cell type is capable of mediating diverse immune tasks. Yet there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that control pDC functions. Dissecting these mechanisms is imperative for the development of pDC-based therapeutics."
Small molecule ISRIB suppresses the integrated stress response within a defined window of activation,"Activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by a variety of stresses triggers phosphorylation of the α-subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2. P-eIF2α inhibits eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recycles inactive eIF2•GDP to active eIF2•GTP. eIF2 phosphorylation thereby represses translation. Persistent activation of the ISR has been linked to the development of several neurological disorders, and modulation of the ISR promises new therapeutic strategies. Recently, a small-molecule ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) was identified that rescues translation in the presence of P-eIF2α by facilitating the assembly of more active eIF2B. ISRIB enhances cognitive memory processes and has therapeutic effects in brain-injured mice without displaying overt side effects. While using ISRIB to investigate the ISR in picornavirus-infected cells, we observed that ISRIB rescued translation early in infection when P-eIF2α levels were low, but not late in infection when P-eIF2α levels were high. By treating cells with varying concentrations of poly(I:C) or arsenite to induce the ISR, we provide additional proof that ISRIB is unable to inhibit the ISR when intracellular P-eIF2α concentrations exceed a critical threshold level. Together, our data demonstrate that the effects of pharmacological activation of eIF2B are tuned by P-eIF2α concentration. Thus, ISRIB can mitigate undesirable outcomes of low-level ISR activation that may manifest neurological disease but leaves the cytoprotective effects of acute ISR activation intact. The insensitivity of cells to ISRIB during acute ISR may explain why ISRIB does not cause overt toxic side effects in vivo.","Activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by a variety of stresses triggers phosphorylation of the α-subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2.

Novel Genes Involved in Endosomal Traffic in Yeast Revealed by Suppression of a Targeting-defective Plasma Membrane ATPase Mutant,"A novel genetic selection was used to identify genes regulating traffic in the yeast endosomal system. We took advantage of a temperature-sensitive mutant in PMA1 , encoding the plasma membrane ATPase, in which newly synthesized Pma1 is mislocalized to the vacuole via the endosome. Diversion of mutant Pma1 from vacuolar delivery and rerouting to the plasma membrane is a major mechanism of suppression of pma1 ts . 16 independent suppressor of pma1 ( sop ) mutants were isolated. Identification of the corresponding genes reveals eight that are identical with VPS genes required for delivery of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins. A second group of SOP genes participates in vacuolar delivery of mutant Pma1 but is not essential for delivery of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y. Because the biosynthetic pathway to the vacuole intersects with the endocytic pathway, internalization of a bulk membrane endocytic marker FM 4-64 was assayed in the sop mutants. By this means, defective endosome-to-vacuole trafficking was revealed in a subset of sop mutants. Another subset of sop mutants displays perturbed trafficking between endosome and Golgi: impaired pro-␣ factor processing in these strains was found to be due to defective recycling of the trans -Golgi protease Kex2. One of these strains defective in Kex2 trafficking carries a mutation in SOP2 , encoding a homologue of mammalian synaptojanin (implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling). Thus, cell surface delivery of mutant Pma1 can occur as a consequence of disturbances at several different sites in the endosomal system.","I n eukaryotic cells, the unique identity of each membrane-bounded compartment is maintained by proper targeting and sorting of proteins. Within the secretory pathway, proteins and lipids move between compartments via vesicular transport (Palade, 1975) . The specificity of this transport is regulated by selective packaging of content into vesicles, specific interaction of receptors on transport vesicles and target membranes, and selective membrane and protein retrieval and retention (Rothman and Wieland, 1996; Schekman and Orci, 1996) . In recent years, many components of the vesicular transport machinery, as well as regulatory molecules that confer specificity and directionality, have been identified and characterized. The endosomal membrane system is a branch of the secretory pathway in which biosynthetic traffic intersects with endocytic traffic from the cell surface. Among the best-characterized processes in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway is the mechanism by which newly synthesized soluble hydrolases are delivered to the lysosome (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989) . In mammalian cells, proteins tagged with a mannose-6-phosphate sorting signal interact with mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi complex. The interaction leads to sorting away from secreted proteins and delivery to endosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989) . In yeast, Ͼ 40 VPS genes encode proteins required for proper trafficking from the Golgi to the vacuole (Rothman and Stevens, 1986; Robinson et al., 1988) . The hallmark of vps mutants is abnormal delivery of vacuolar enzyme precursors, such as procarboxypeptidase Y, to the cell surface. As in mammalian cells, there is a sorting receptor, encoded by VPS10 , whose recognition of a signal within carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) 1 and other soluble hydrolases in the late Golgi compartment is required for proper delivery via endosomes to the vacuole (Vida et al., 1993; Marcusson et al., 1994; Cooper and Stevens, 1996) . Vps10 and other late Golgi membrane proteins, e.g., Kex2, are thought to maintain their localization by cycling between the Golgi and endosome compartments in a manner controlled by signals in their cytoplasmic tails (Cooper and Bussey, 1992; Wilcox et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993; Cereghino et al., 1995; Cooper and Stevens, 1996) ."
Tubuloreticular Inclusions in the Absence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and HIV Infection: A Report of Three Pediatric Cases,"Tubuloreticular inclusions (TRIs) are subcellular structures located within the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. Formation of TRIs has been linked to the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources. In renal disease, TRIs have been most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection. The first patient presented at 2 years of age with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and TRIs. The second patient presented at 6 months of age with infantile nephrotic syndrome, and his renal biopsy revealed membranous Case Rep Nephrol Dial 2017;7:91-101 ","Tubuloreticular inclusions (TRIs) are 20-to 28-nm subcellular structures, made of phospholipids. They appear as anastomosing membranous tubules in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum on electron microscopy (EM) [1] . They are found in endothelial and lymphoreticular cells, and other cells such as connective tissue, neural, and epithelial cells [1] . They were first described in the 1960s and had different names at different points in time [2] . TRIs have been strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and some other viral infections [3] .

Open Access 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea: hospital-to-hospital transmission,"The distinct characteristic of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea is that it not only involves intra-hospital transmission, but it also involves hospital-to-hospital transmission. It has been the largest MERS outbreak outside the Middle East, with 186 confirmed cases and, among them, 36 fatal cases as of July 26, 2015. All confirmed cases are suspected to be hospital-acquired infections except one case of household transmission and two cases still undergoing examination. The Korean health care system has been the major factor shaping the unique characteristics of the outbreak. Taking this as an opportunity, the Korean government should carefully assess the fundamental problems of the vulnerability to hospital infection and make short-as well as long-term plans for countermeasures. In addition, it is hoped that this journal, Epidemiology and Health, becomes a place where various topics regarding MERS can be discussed and shared.","The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an RNA virus in the family of Coronaviridae, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia [1] . Information on the mode of transmission of the virus remains limited at the moment. Furthermore, there is no effective medication or vaccine against MERS, and it shows a high case fatality rate of 40% [2] [3] [4] ."
Short-hairpin RNAs delivered by lentiviral vector transduction trigger RIG-I-mediated IFN activation,"Activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a major contributor to the off-target effects of RNA interference in mammalian cells. While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different compositional and structural requirements, have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed shorthairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence-and 5 0 -triphosphatedependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor-3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA. We also demonstrated that retinoic-acid-inducible gene I, and not melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 or toll-like receptor 3, is the cytoplasmic sensor for intracellularly expressed shRNAs that trigger IFN activation.","A specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure, $21-22 bp dsRNA with 3 0 overhangs, plays a critical role in initiating both microRNA (miRNA)-and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing, as it is the structure recognized by the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (1) (2) (3) . Except for preformed siRNA duplexes of $21 bp, the RISC-loaded small RNAs are generated by a ribonuclease (RNase) III-like enzyme that is found in virtually all eukaryotic organisms. This enzyme, aptly named Dicer for its ability to cleave a variety of larger (>30 bp) dsRNA molecules into the $21 bp dsRNA with a characteristic 3 0 overhang of 2 nt, is a multidomain RNA-binding protein and itself a component of RISC."
Hemagglutinin-targeting Artificial MicroRNAs Expressed by Adenovirus Protect Mice From Different Clades of H5N1 Infection Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids,"Influenza virus (IV) is a continuously evolving virus that widely spreads in humans and contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality. Re-emergence of human infection with avian influenza virus H5N1 poses extra challenge to IV control. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated RNA interference has become a powerful antiviral approach due to its high specificity and rapid effect. Here, we designed several amiRNAs targeting the hemagglutinin gene of H5N1, a major determinant of pathogenicity. Expression and delivery efficiency were enhanced by presenting functional amiRNA with chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68). One amiRNA, HA-1405, significantly limited H5N1 replication in vitro and inhibited 96.7% of clade 2.3.2 replication. AdC68-conjugated HA-1405 treatment remarkably decreased different clades of H5N1 plaque formation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Moreover, prophylactic administration with rAd(HA-1405) markedly alleviated clinical symptoms and reduced ~3to 40-folds of lung viral RNA copies against four clades of H5N1 in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Our results further showed that rAd(HA-1405) conferred 70 and 40% immediate protection against lethal clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 challenge, respectively. In conclusion, these data provided information that HA-targeting amiRNA delivered by AdC68 could be pursued as a potential agent for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention.","Influenza viruses (IV) widely spread among diverse hosts and lead to seasonal outbreaks annually, which cost millions of human lives and significant economic losses. 1 In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was firstly reported to transmit from poultry to human in Hong Kong. 2 Ever since then, this subtype continuously circulated in domestic and wild birds and sporadically caused human infections. Up to now, 844 cases from 16 countries have been documented in the World Health Organization with the fatality rate of ~53% (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) , among which 52 cases were confirmed in China (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/). Exposure to sick poultry was considered a major risk factor of H5N1 infection. 3 However, several episodes of potential human-to-human transmission raised more concerns about H5N1 pandemic. 4 Strain-matched vaccines are viewed as the best preventative strategy for IVs, whereas the development of H5N1 vaccines encounters extra obstacles than seasonal flu ones. 5 On one hand, H5N1 virus is lethal to chicken embryos, thus the yield of egg-dependent inactivated vaccines is largely restricted. On the other hand, operations with HPAI H5N1 have to be performed in biosafety level 3 facilities. Moreover, neutralizing antibody-based vaccines usually take several days before onset. Thus, novel egg-free avian IV vaccines that could take immediate effect could be an appropriate supplementary."
"Localization and Targeting of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kre2p/Mnt lp oL 1,2-Mannosyltransferase to a medial.Gol Compartment","The yeast Kre2p/Mntlp cxl,2-mannosyltransferase is a type II membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic amino terminus, a membrane-spanning region, and a large catalytic luminal domain containing one N-glycosylation site. Anti-Kre2p/Mntlp antibodies identify a 60-kD integral membrane protein that is progressively N-glycosylated in an MNNl-dependent manner. Kre2p/Mntlp is localized in a Golgi compartment that overlaps with that containing the medial-Golgi mannosyltransferase Mnnlp, and distinct from that including the late Golgi protein Kexlp. To determine which regions of Kre2p/Mntlp are required for Golgi localization, Kre2p/Mntlp mutant proteins were assem-bled by substitution of Kre2p domains with equivalent sequences from the vacuolar proteins DPAP B and Pho8p. Chimeric proteins were tested for correct topology, in vitro and in vivo activity, and were localized intracellularly by indirect immunofluorescence. The resuits demonstrate that the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain is necessary for correct Kre2p Golgi localization whereas, the membrane-spanning and stem domains are dispensable. However, in a test of targeting sufficiency, the presence of the entire Kre2p cytoplasmic tail, plus the transmembrane domain and a 36-amino acid residue luminal stem region was required to localize a Pho8p reporter protein to the yeast Golgi. T HE Golgi apparatus plays a fundamental role in glycan processing and sorting of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. The Golgi apparatus of a typical mammalian cell is composed of a polarized stack of membranous saccules that are differentiated into functionally distinct subcompartments. After the addition of core N-linked sugar moieties in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycoproteins proceed through the cis-Golgi network, the cis-, medial-, and transcisternae, and the trans-Golgi network, where further modifications take place. These include the addition of O-linked sugars and the elaboration, in a protein-specific manner, of complex N-linked carbohydrate structures. The Golgi apparatus also constitutes a major organelle responsible for protein trafficking where particular proteins are directed to precise cellular locations. Two specific Golgi subcompartments have been found to be involved in protein sorting. The cis-Golgi network constitutes the site from which many resident ER proteins are retrieved, and the main function of the TGN is to direct glycoproteins exiting the Golgi complex to either the lysosome or the cell surface (","cesses have been studied from genetic and biochemical perspectives (Kukuruzinska et al., 1987; Pryer et al., 1992) resulting in a functionally defined Golgi apparatus that has been subdivided into several subcompartments on the basis of asparagine-linked (N-linked) 1 oligosaccharide modifications (Franzusoff and Schekman, 1989; Graham and Emr, 1991; Wilsbach and Payne, 1993; Gaynor et al., 1994) . In yeast, secretory pathway glycoproteins can acquire two types of N-linked oligosaccharides, either a simple core carbohydrate or one extended by an outer-chain glycan structure. The N-linked core oligosaccharide elaborated in the ER is mainly constituted of MansGlcNAc2 and may undergo Golgi maturation resulting in Man9.13_ GlcNAc2. In other cases, glycoproteins traversing the Golgi apparatus have their core oligosaccharide extended by outer chains (see Fig. 2 ; Ballou, 1990; Herscovics and Orlean, 1993) . The initial step in outer-chain synthesis takes place and defines an early Golgi compartment in which a backbone of ed,6-1inked mannose residues is attached to the core oligosaccharide. This Golgi compartment has been likened to the mammalian cis-Golgi network (Wilsbach and Payne, 1993) . Outer chain elaboration is then brought to completion: the al,6-1inked mannose structure is enlarged in a sequential fashion by al,2-and al,3-mannosyltransferases in a subsequent distinct com-partment defining the yeast medial-Golgi compartment."
Mechanism of Cxc Chemokine Ligand 5 (CXCL5)/ Cxc Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) Bio-Axis in Mice with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome This work is licensed under Creative Common Attribution- NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0),"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common acute and severe disease in clinic.

The present study investigated the role of the CXCL5/Cxc chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) bio-axis in ARDS, and explored the underlying molecular mechanism.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a disease characterized by progressive dyspnea with refractory hypoxemia, which results from abnormal synthesis of pulmonary surfactant [1] . Obstinate hypoxemia and pulmonary edema in ARDS are caused by injury, shock, and other factors [2] . The pathological process of ARDS can be divided into 3 stages: the exudative stage (early stage), the proliferative stage (middle stage), and the fibrosis stage (late stage). At the exudative stage of ARDS, many cytokines and chemokines promote the pathological and physiological process of ARDS [3] [4] [5] , showing that inflammation is closely related to the development of ARDS."
"The three transfer RNAs occupying the A, P and E sites on the ribosome are involved in viral programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift","The -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifts (PRF), which are used by many viruses, occur at a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and are currently thought to involve the tRNAs interacting with the ribosomal P-and A-site codons. We investigated here whether the tRNA occupying the ribosomal E site that precedes a slippery site influences -1 PRF. Using the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) frameshift region, we found that mutating the E-site codon altered the -1 PRF efficiency. When the HIV-1 slippery sequence was replaced with other viral slippery sequences, mutating the E-site codon also altered the -1 PRF efficiency. Because HIV-1 -1 PRF can be recapitulated in bacteria, we used a bacterial ribosome system to select, by random mutagenesis, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) mutations that modify the expression of a reporter requiring HIV-1 -1 PRF. Three mutants were isolated, which are located in helices 21 and 22 of 16S rRNA, a region involved in translocation and E-site tRNA binding. We propose a novel model where -1 PRF is triggered by an incomplete translocation and depends not only on the tRNAs interacting with the P-and A-site codons, but also on the tRNA occupying the E site.","The -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) is a nonconventional translation phenomenon that pertains to a particular change in the reading frame of the messenger RNA (mRNA) induced by a stimulatory signal. This strategy is mainly used by viruses to synthesize the precursor of their enzymes and to maintain a specific ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins (1) . In addition, -1 PRF is used during the translation of some prokaryotic and eukaryotic mRNAs (2) . One of the bestknown examples of -1 PRF occurs when ribosomes translate the full-length mRNA of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (3) (4) (5) . A -1 PRF is induced by two cis-elements within the mRNA: a slippery heptanucleotide X XXY YYZ (X is any nucleotide, Y is either A or U and Z is not a G in eukaryotes; spaces indicate the initial reading frame), where the -1 PRF occurs, and a following specific RNA secondary structure, the so-called stimulatory signal. This RNA structure is often a pseudoknot (4) but can also be a stem-loop, as it is the case for HIV-1 (6) (7) (8) , or a three-way stem-loop, as found in bacterial insertion sequences (9, 10) . The stimulatory signal controls the -1 PRF efficiency by making the ribosome pause over the slippery sequence (11) (12) (13) . However, pausing itself is not sufficient to promote -1 PRF (14) , and it was proposed that the stimulatory signal has a specific interaction with the ribosome. Altering the -1 PRF efficiency impairs viral replication (15) (16) (17) and it has been observed that even a small change in -1 PRF efficiency substantially handicaps the replication capacity of HIV-1 (18) . This indicates that the -1 PRF event could serve as a target for the design and development of new antiviral drugs. It is thus important to fully understand the -1 PRF mechanism."
"Nonproliferative and Proliferative Lesions of the Gastrointestinal Tract, Pancreas and Salivary Glands of the Rat and Mouse","The INHAND (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice) project is a joint initiative of the Societies of Toxicologic Pathology from Europe (ESTP), Great Britain (BSTP), Japan (JSTP), and North America (STP) to develop an internationally accepted nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for nonproliferative and proliferative lesions in laboratory animals. The purpose of this publication is to provide a standardized nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for classifying lesions in the digestive system including the salivary glands and the exocrine pancreas of laboratory rats and mice. Most lesions are illustrated by color photomicrographs. The standardized nomenclature, the diagnostic criteria, and the photomicrographs are also available electronically on the Internet (http://www.goreni.org/). Sources of material included histopathology databases from government, academia, and industrial laboratories throughout the world. Content includes spontaneous and age related lesions as well as lesions induced by exposure to test items. Relevant infectious and parasitic lesions are included as well. A widely accepted and utilized international harmonization of nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for the digestive system will decrease misunderstandings among regulatory and scientific research organizations in different countries and provide a common language to increase and enrich international exchanges of information among toxicologists and pathologists.",The digestive tract is the entry site into the body for orally administered test articles.

mTOR inhibitors lower an intrinsic barrier to virus infection mediated by IFITM3,"Rapamycin and its derivatives are specific inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and, as a result, are wellestablished immunosuppressants and antitumorigenic agents. Additionally, this class of drug promotes gene delivery by facilitating lentiviral vector entry into cells, revealing its potential to improve gene therapy efforts. However, the precise mechanism was unknown. Here, we report that mTOR inhibitor treatment results in down-regulation of the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITM proteins, especially IFITM3, are potent inhibitors of virus-cell fusion and are broadly active against a range of pathogenic viruses. We found that the effect of rapamycin treatment on lentiviral transduction is diminished upon IFITM silencing or knockout in primary and transformed cells, and the extent of transduction enhancement depends on basal expression of IFITM proteins, with a major contribution from IFITM3. The effect of rapamycin treatment on IFITM3 manifests at the level of protein, but not mRNA, and is selective, as many other endosome-associated transmembrane proteins are unaffected. Rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3 requires endosomal trafficking, ubiquitination, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, and lysosomal acidification. Since IFITM proteins exhibit broad antiviral activity, we show that mTOR inhibition also promotes infection by another IFITM-sensitive virus, Influenza A virus, but not infection by Sendai virus, which is IFITM-resistant. Our results identify the molecular basis by which mTOR inhibitors enhance virus entry into cells and reveal a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive feature of these clinically important drugs.

Invagination of the plasma membrane and carefully regulated fission events give rise to ""early"" endocytic vesicles that ferry cargo into a recycling circuit, in which contents are returned to the cell surface, or a pathway terminating in highly acidified lysosomes. Protein transport to lysosomes occurs following lysosome fusion with ""late"" endosomes or with specialized structures known as autophagosomes. In the former, late endosomes deliver enzymes needed for lysosome function, as well as endocytosed material destined for proteolytic degradation (2, 3) . Fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes gives rise to hybrid organelles known as endolysosomes, a name which is also used to generally describe the late endosome/lysosome compartment since methods to distinguish them are inadequate. Late endosomes are also known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) due to the presence of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is required for sorting ubiquitinated protein cargo into ILVs, which are subsequently degraded by lysosomal hydrolases as late endosomes/MVBs fuse with lysosomes (4) (5) (6) ."
"Chemo-enzymatic synthesis of site-specific isotopically labeled nucleotides for use in NMR resonance assignment, dynamics and structural characterizations","Stable isotope labeling is central to NMR studies of nucleic acids. Development of methods that incorporate labels at specific atomic positions within each nucleotide promises to expand the size range of RNAs that can be studied by NMR. Using recombinantly expressed enzymes and chemically synthesized ribose and nucleobase, we have developed an inexpensive, rapid chemo-enzymatic method to label ATP and GTP site specifically and in high yields of up to 90%. We incorporated these nucleotides into RNAs with sizes ranging from 27 to 59 nucleotides using in vitro transcription: A-Site (27 nt), the iron responsive elements (29 nt), a fluoride riboswitch from Bacillus anthracis (48 nt), and a frame-shifting element from a human corona virus (59 nt). Finally, we showcase the improvement in spectral quality arising from reduced crowding and narrowed linewidths, and accurate analysis of NMR relaxation dispersion (CPMG) and TROSY-based CEST experiments to measure sms time scale motions, and an improved NOESY strategy for resonance assignment. Applications of this selective labeling technology promises to reduce difficulties associated with chemical shift overlap and rapid signal decay that have made it challenging to study the structure and dynamics of large RNAs beyond the 50 nt median size found in the PDB.","The tertiary architectures RNAs adopt are crucial for modulating gene expression across all domains of life, making them important targets of structural and dynamics studies. For instance, for riboswitches, the presence or absence of specific ligands drives the folding of one of two or more mutually exclusive, regulatory states (1) (2) (3) (4) . In viral RNA genomes, structured, untranslated regions commonly exercise direct control over viral gene expression (5, 6) . In the ribosome, the ability to distinguish between cognate and near-cognate tRNAs is governed in part by the extrahelical flipping of adenines A1492 and A1493 (7) . Both the global architecture and the subtle motions of specific base and ribose moieties are thus demonstrably important and can profoundly modulate an RNA's function (8) ."
A Case of Statin-Induced Interstitial Pneumonitis due to Rosuvastatin,"Statins lower the hyperlipidemia and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and related mortality. A 60-year-old man who was diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack was started on acetyl-L-carnitine, cilostazol, and rosuvastatin. After rosuvastatin treatment for 4 weeks, the patient presented with sudden onset fever, cough, and dyspnea. His symptoms were aggravated despite empirical antibiotic treatment. All infectious pathogens were excluded based on results of culture and polymerase chain reaction of the bronchoscopic wash specimens. Chest radiography showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs, along with several subpleural ground-glass opacity nodules; and a foamy alveolar macrophage appearance was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. We suspected rosuvastatin-induced lung injury, discontinued rosuvastatin and initiated prednisolone 1 mg/kg tapered over 2weeks. After initiating steroid therapy, his symptoms and radiologic findings significantly improved.

,"Treatment of emerging RNA viruses is hampered by the high mutation and replication rates that enable these viruses to operate as a quasispecies. Declining honey bee populations have been attributed to the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and its affiliation with Deformed Wing Virus (DWV). In the current study we use next-generation sequencing to investigate the DWV quasispecies in an apiary known to suffer from overwintering colony losses. We show that the DWV species complex is made up of three master variants. Our results indicate that a new DWV Type C variant is distinct from the previously described types A and B, but together they form a distinct clade compared with other members of the Iflaviridae. The molecular clock estimation predicts that Type C diverged from the other variants ∼ 319 years ago. The discovery of a new master variant of DWV has important implications for the positive identification of the true pathogen within global honey bee populations.","RNA viruses have rapid replication and high error rates, leading to immense diversity within each viral replication cycle (Domingo and Holland, 1997) . As a result, many RNA viruses are highly genetically heterogeneous and exist within infected population structures known as quasispecies. It has been proposed that this gives these viral pathogens an increased ability to shift to a new environmental niche, such as a new host, as a suitable mutant is more likely to already exist if this opportunity arises. However, if the diversity within a quasispecies becomes too high, deleterious mutations can accumulate leading to loss of overall fitness (Clarke et al., 1993) . The adaptability and host range of a virus are a function of the level of diversity found within a quasispecies (termed the quasispecies swarm size) (Schneider and Roossinck, 2001) . As well as a randomly generated swarm of mutants around one variant, quasispecies can also exist as a number of master variants, each with their own swarm of random mutations (Palacios et al., 2008; Lauring and Andino, 2010) . Determining the extent of genetic heterogeneity in virus populations thus has important implications for predicting and preventing emerging viral diseases."
Differential chemokine expression patterns in tonsillar disease Differenti pattern di espressione delle chemochine nella patologia tonsillare,"Expression profiles of CXC-and CC-chemokines in various forms of tonsillar disease were studied to evaluate whether certain chemokines play a predominant role in a specific subset of tonsillar disease. Total RNA was isolated from 89 biopsies (21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histological prove of acute inflammation), reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR amplifying IL-8, Gro-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES. 2% agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a predominance of IL-8 in the chronic inflammatory palatine tonsil group compared to tonsillar hyperplasia. Furthermore, eotaxin-2 was strongly overexpressed in adenoid samples compared to chronic inflammatory specimens. Our data suggest that the majority of diseases related to adenoid formation are mediated via an eotaxin-2 expression, whereas chronic inflammatory tonsillitis is associated with IL-8 upregulation. These data imply that adenoids are related to a Th-2, and chronic inflammatory tonsillitis to a Th-1 based immune response.","In 1884, Waldeyer first described an annular arrangement of lymphatic tissue at the entrance of the aerodigestive tract, which he suggested plays an important part in the host immune system, including the palatine tonsils, pharyngeal tonsil, lingual tonsils and tubal tonsils 1 . Especially the palatine as well as pharyngeal tonsils are known to play a key role in the development of the human host defense due to their location, histologic anatomy and functional capacities 2 .

The combination of these different tissues as well as their anatomic arrangement in crypts facilitates optimised exposure and processing of antigens, which aid in evoking effective immune responses 5 6 . The palatine as well as the pharyngeal tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs and an integral part of the mucosa associated lymphatic tissue complex 7 . Multiplication, differentiation and stimulation of B-lymphocytes represent one of their major functions and are essential in processing the specific immune response 8 . B-lymphocytes constitute more than 50% of the tonsillar lymphocyte population, in contrast to the blood and other lymphoid organs 9 10 . The induction of the tonsillar-specific immune responses involves several distinct processes where chemokines play an integral role [11] [12] [13] [14] . Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines, which can be classified into four subgroups depending on their arrangement of amino acids, namely CXC-, CC-, C-and CX 3 C-chemokines 15 16 . CXC-chemokines, like interleukin (IL)-8 and growth-regulated peptide -alpha (GRO-alpha), are responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophils, whereas CCchemokines, like eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), promote the attraction of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils 17 . The presented work investigated the importance of different chemokines, i.e. IL-8, GRO-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES in tonsillar inflammatory disease and tonsil hyperplasia."
Specific interference shRNA-expressing plasmids inhibit Hantaan virus infection in vitro and in vivo,"Methods: Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. Results: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, and 4 μg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose-and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 μg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 μg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys. Conclusion: Plasmid-based shRNAs potently inhibit HTNV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide a basis for development of shRNA as therapeutics for HTNV infections in humans.","Hantaviruses represent one of the important emerging and re-emerging viral groups and have become a global threat to public health in different areas of the world [1, 2] . Hantaviruses lead to two severe febrile diseases worldwide, ie, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia due to Old World hantavirus and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas due to New World hantavirus [3] . Approximately 60 000-100 000 HFRS cases are reported each year worldwide, and the mortality rate can reach 10% [1, 4] . Hantaviruses belong to the genus Hantavirus of the Bunyaviridae family, and they are enveloped, single-strand, negative-sense, tri-segmented RNA viruses. The viral genomes consist of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a nucleocapsid (N) protein. Variations in the M and S segments may influence the antigenicity and virulence of hantaviruses [5, 6] ."

Implementation System of a Biosurveillance System in the Republic of Korea and Its Legal Ramifications,"Laws are fundamental tools that regulate and manage various issues to protect the rights of the people in a society. Legislation on disease surveillance enables agencies to regulate and manage public health, including preventing the spread of infectious diseases. We assessed the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act of Korea (IDPCA) through the lens of biosurveillance to understand its effectiveness in protecting public health. In addition, the relevant legislation and regulations of the United States and the World Health Organization were examined. The evaluation concludes that the current IDPCA is limited in terms of providing guidance for early detection of and response to hazards using integrated data and an information-sharing system. Further revision of the laws is needed to enable early detection and warning of potential threats to public health.","T he 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea (ROK) was the second largest outbreak of its kind, with 186 confirmed cases and 38 deaths. 1 In addition, increasing international travel and infectious disease outbreaks in recent decades have prompted further calls to strengthen national surveillance systems. 2 During the MERS outbreak in 2015, national legislation pertaining to infectious diseases did not include guidelines on MERS. Because of the lack of guidelines and previous experience with MERS, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) failed to provide a timely response. 3 Given that outbreaks of disease occur beyond predictions and jurisdictional boundaries, the ROK government initiated intergovernmental programs. One such program is the big data-based Food Poisoning Prediction Model, developed in 2015. 4 The model was developed by several government departments to prevent and control outbreaks of foodborne illness. In 2019, the intergovernmental Joint Response to Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria project was initiated. This was based on the understanding that combating antimicrobial resistance requires an integrated approach focused on humans, animals, and the environment. 5 Despite these intergovernmental programs to strengthen surveillance systems, a framework to ensure sustained coordination among government departments has yet to be established. Coordination among departments for temporary programs often is not sustained over the long term. To facilitate rapid detection and response to public health threats, systematic coordination of departments is vital. The United States has led implementation of biosurveillance systems involving coordination among multiple agencies, and other countries are rapidly following suit. 6, 7 In the ROK, infectious disease surveillance is carried out by the KCDC under the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Infectious disease surveillance involves the continuous collection and analysis of data, mostly from reports of medical personnel. 8 Traditional infectious disease surveillance, including the existing system in the ROK, focuses on human diseases and does not incorporate the concept that disease outbreaks can be spread by nonhuman vectors. 9 To address these limitations of the current infectious disease surveillance system of the ROK, means of strengthening the current system should be explored in the context of biosurveillance. Unlike infectious disease surveillance, which tends to target only identified cases, biosurveillance requires the integration of dispersed data on human and animal health."
Viral metagenomics reveals the presence of highly divergent quaranjavirus in Rhipicephalus ticks from Mozambique,"Background: Ticks are primary vectors for many well-known disease-causing agents that affect human and animal populations globally such as tick-borne encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and African swine fever. In this study, viral metagenomics was used to identify what viruses are present in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected in the Zambezi Valley of Mozambique. Methods: The RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences. Results: The majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the Orthomyxoviridae family, although viruses similar to the Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained and these showed an amino acid identity of 32-52% to known quaranjaviruses. The sequences were most closely related to the Wellfleet Bay virus, detected and isolated from common eider during a mortality event in the USA. Conclusions: In summary, this study has identified a highly divergent virus with in the Orthomyxoviridae family associated with Rhipicephalus ticks from Mozambique. Further genetic and biological studies are needed in order to investigate potential pathogenesis of the identified orthomyxovirus.","Arthropods can act as biological vectors that transmit infectious agents and thereby cause diseases in humans and animals. After mosquitoes, ticks are the most common arthropod vector for viruses, bacteria, and other parasites causing different vector-borne diseases. Ticks from different parts of the world have been shown to carry viruses belonging to, for example, the Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, Asfaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families [1] . Additionally, ticks carry many non-pathogenic microbes, and some of these microbes have formed symbiotic relationships with their hosts and transmit by vertical transmission [2] [3] [4] [5] ."
"Stress, Nutrition, and Intestinal Immune Responses in Pigs -A Review","Modern livestock production became highly intensive and large scaled to increase production efficiency. This production environment could add stressors affecting the health and growth of animals. Major stressors can include environment (air quality and temperature), nutrition, and infection. These stressors can reduce growth performance and alter immune systems at systemic and local levels including the gastrointestinal tract. Heat stress increases the permeability, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses in the gut. Nutritional stress from fasting, antinutritional compounds, and toxins induces the leakage and destruction of the tight junction proteins in the gut. Fasting is shown to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas deoxynivalenol increases the recruitment of intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokines and the level of lymphocytes in the gut. Pathogenic and viral infections such as Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus can lead to loosening the intestinal epithelial barrier. On the other hand, supplementation of Lactobacillus or Saccharaomyces reduced infectious stress by ETEC. It was noted that major stressors altered the permeability of intestinal barriers and profiles of genes and proteins of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mucosal system in pigs. However, it is not sufficient to fully explain the mechanism of the gut immune system in pigs under stress conditions. Correlation and interaction of gut and systemic immune system under major stressors should be better defined to overcome aforementioned obstacles. (","Intestinal mucosa acts primarily as a barrier between inner part of the body and external environment. In livestock animals and humans, large quantities of various food antigens digested and absorbed are immunologically tolerable in general at intestinal mucosa. Morphology and characteristics of intestinal mucosa together with intestinal immune cells are constantly changing dependent on the food composition. A large number of pathogens, entering the body through the intestinal mucosa, are rapidly eliminated by protective mucosal immune responses. Otherwise, the intestine is normally home to many different commensal bacteria, continuously exposed to food proteins. As a result, the intestinal immune system must be able to discriminate harmless antigens from harmful ones (Wilson et al., 1996) ."
,"A 7-year-old neutered female domestic shorthaired cat born in Poland and then moved to Japan presented to the local clinic with recent onset of convulsive cluster seizures and status epilepticus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral swelling of the hippocampus with T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancing image, suggesting hippocampal necrosis. The cat completely recovered after treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AED) and administration of prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q24h for 4 days and tapered). However, cluster seizures reoccurred and developed into status epilepticus despite increasing doses of AED. Although the convulsions were resolved by other AEDs, stupor and renal failure developed, and the cat was euthanized. Pathological findings were consistent with hippocampal necrosis. Immunological analysis for leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) autoantibodies was negative, but antibodies against DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) known as netrin-1 receptor were found. This report describes a case of feline autoimmune limbic encephalitis and hippocampal necrosis that were presumably associated with DCC autoantibodies.","and feline coronavirus and Toxoplasma gondii titers were 1 : 100 and <1 : 8, respectively. In addition, RT-PCR of Borna disease virus using a serum sample was negative. The heart rate was around 200 rpm, and the mean blood pressure was 95-100 mm Hg. Thoracic and abdominal X-rays were normal. These clinical findings suggested the cat was in postictal state, in nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or extreme sensitivity to the adverse effects of PB. Phenobarbital was discontinued, and zonisamide (ZNS; 4.6 mg/kg PO q12h), meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg SC q24h), ampicillin (25 mg/kg IV q12h), and IV fluid therapy with glycyrrhizin and glutathione were administered. Two days later (day 7), seizures were under control, and the above-mentioned neurological findings and temperature had recovered. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.4 Tesla Aperto; Hitachi, Japan) of the head was performed on day 8, which revealed bilateral hippocampal swelling with T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity and T1-weighted hypointensity that showed strong contrast enhancement after IV administration of gadodiamide (0.2 mL/kg; Omniscan, Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) on transverse ( Figure 1 ) and dorsal planes."
WHO's Global School Health Initiative. 1995. 4 WHO. Helsinki statement on health in all policies. 2013. 5 WHO. Health 2020. A European policy framework and stra-tegy for the 21 st century 2013,"E8 piuttosto che articoli eccellenti al termine del processo decisionale. Egli conclude suggerendo che la sintesi accurata delle evidenze disponibili è il contributo più importante che il mondo accademico può dare al processo decisionale, anche in termini di valutazione economica degli interventi sanitari, atteso che i responsabili delle politiche sanitarie prendono decisioni che implicano l'utilizzo di cospicue risorse economiche. L'aumento della pressione economica impone la necessità di scegliere ""saggiamente"" e investire su ciò che ""funziona"" per migliorare la salute della comunità.","Nel promuovere e gestire i cambiamenti necessari per coniugare pratiche sicure ed efficaci con l'efficienza, l'equità e la sostenibilità dei servizi sanitari, essenziale è la conoscenza, la diffusione e l'adesione alle raccomandazioni per la pratica professionale derivanti da linee guida (LG). In Italia la Legge 24/2017 (""Disposizioni in materia di sicurezza delle cure e della persona assistita, nonché in materia di responsabilità professionale degli esercenti le professioni sanitarie""), stabilendo che ""gli esercenti le professioni sanitarie, nell'esecuzione delle prestazioni sanitarie con finalità preventive, diagnostiche, terapeutiche, palliative, riabilitative e di medicina legale, si attengono, salve le specificità del caso concreto, alle raccomandazioni previste dalle linee guida pubblicate ed elaborate da enti e istituzioni pubblici e privati nonché dalle società scientifiche e dalle associazioni tecnicoscientifiche delle professioni sanitarie iscritte in apposito elenco"", ha rinnovato l'impulso legislativo, culturale, professionale e scientifico alla diffusione delle LG nel Servizio Sanitario Nazionale. L'attuale quadro regolamentare italiano prevede che la loro produzione venga garantita sulla base degli standard di predisposizione e valutazione della qualità metodologica definiti dal Centro Nazionale per l'Eccellenza Clinica (CNEC) dell'Istituto Superiore di Sanità, punto di riferimento per l'attuazione del nuovo Sistema Nazionale Linee Guida (istituito con il DM 27 febbraio 2018) (https://snlg.iss.it). Secondo la vigente definizione adottata dal CNEC, le LG sono uno ""strumento di supporto decisionale finalizzato a consentire che, fra opzioni alternative, sia adottata quella che offre un migliore bilancio fra benefici ed effetti indesiderati, tenendo conto della esplicita e sistematica valutazione delle prove disponibili, commisurandola alle circostanze peculiari del caso concreto e condividendola-laddove possibile-con il paziente o i caregiver"". Le linee guida servono dunque a supportare i processi decisionali che connotano la pratica professionale preventiva, diagnostica, terapeutica e assistenziale, ma anche le scelte manageriali e le politiche sanitarie. Ai diversi livelli del sistema sanitario, infatti, la disponibilità di LG è fondamentale per contrastare alcune delle criticità sistemiche della sanità connesse, tra l'altro, all'erogazione di cure di qualità sub-ottimale, alla variazione ingiustificata di pratiche ed esiti e alle diseguaglianze, in un quadro di risorse limitate. Se dunque oggi il valore delle linee guida per la pratica clinica è indiscutibile in tutti gli ambiti disciplinari della medicina, peculiare è il significato, professionale e organizzativo, che le stesse possono assumere nello sviluppo e nella specifica applicazione alla sanità pubblica. In particolare, la sanità pubblica si caratterizza per: la forte eterogeneità nelle evidenze scientifiche disponibili (non di rado costituite solamente da studi osservazionali), l'adozione di un approccio di population health e la frequente individuazione di target costituiti da persone sane, la molteplicità (anche in relazione all'importanza attribuita dagli stakeholder coinvolti) degli ambiti di produzione di linee guida (www.who.int/publications/guidelines), degli interventi sanitari e degli outcome individuati nei contesti reali (e non di ricerca), condizionati da una molteplicità di variabili culturali, organizzative, socio-economiche e ambientali. Spesso le raccomandazioni prodotte in sanità pubblica sono destinate ad avere un impatto quali-quantitativamente molto rilevante sul sistema sanitario e necessitano di modelli in grado di prevederne l'implementazione, non sempre agevolmente correlabili alle evidenze scientifiche disponibili a priori. Altresì, il percorso di costruzione del consenso e implementazione degli interventi è articolato e complesso. In misura maggiore rispetto ad altre discipline mediche, i comportamenti degli operatori non si basano solo sulle conoscenze tecnico-scientifiche disponibili (talora limitate e non sempre esplicitamente generalizzabili), ma risentono e sono condizionati da dettati normativi, meccanismi di consenso locale, eterogeneità di strutture erogatrici e risorse (professionali, organizzative e tecnologiche), nonché da relazioni con una molteplicità di portatori di interesse dentro e fuori il sistema sanitario (che a loro volta esprimono valori e preferenze anche contrastanti). Il metodo scelto dal CNEC (e adottato anche dall'Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco per le valutazioni di propria competenza) per la produzione di linee guida è il metodo GRADE -Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation -che costituisce oggi la principale cornice riferimento per la valutazione di affidabilità delle prove scientifiche e per la formulazione di raccomandazioni cliniche basate sulle evidenze in sanità: viene utilizzato da più di 100 organizzazioni in tutto il mondo comprendenti anche l'Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità e il National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (www.gradeworkinggroup.org). Il GRADE assicura standardizzazione e trasparenza della procedura con cui viene valutata la qualità delle prove disponibili e la forza delle raccomandazioni per la produzione di linee guida, favorendo una valutazione integrata della qualità metodologica delle prove disponibili con altri aspetti che devono essere considerati per sviluppare e stabilire la forza di una raccomandazione, mediante i cosiddetti Evidence to Decision Framework, quali: priorità della problematica trattata (es. impatto sanitario, variabilità, costi), benefici e rischi attesi, valori e preferenze dei pazienti, costoefficacia, accettabilità, fattibilità ed equità. Il GRADE offre un approccio flessibile e pragmatico che può essere applicato sia alla produzione di una linea guida ex novo che all'adattamento di linee guida già esistenti, per le quali si applicano gli schemi di GRADE-ADOLOPMENT, calibrati su un determinato contesto culturale e organizzativo. Il panel di esperti (gruppi di lavoro multidisciplinari e multistakeholder che sistematicamente devono coinvolgere anche utenti/cittadini) definisce chiaramente la domanda di ricerca, il protocollo condiviso secondo l'acronimo PICO (Patient-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome) per l'analisi della qualità delle prove di evidenza ed esprimere giudizi sui diversi criteri di valutazione necessari alla formulazione e valutazione della forza delle raccomandazioni. Mediante una gestione trasparente (e una particolare attenzione alla disclosure e alla gestione dei conflitti di interesse dei membri dei panel), fortemente ancorata al mondo reale, con il processo di ""evidence to decision"" il GRADE si pone l'obiettivo di ordinare per gradi la forza delle raccomandazioni espresse dai panel di esperti in modo da offrire strumenti interpretativi e decisionali per pazienti/utenti, clinici e decisori sanitari. La rappresentatività e il coinvolgimento con modalità strutturate di tutte le figure competenti e rilevanti per i quesiti e sulle raccomandazioni in oggetto costituisce un aspetto fondamentale di qualità e credibilità della linea guida. Accanto alla chiara affinità tra metodo GRADE e logiche epidemiologiche e di centralità di un approccio multidimensionale, multidisciplinare e inter-professionale che caratterizza il processo decisionale in sanità pubblica, è interessante evidenziare l'opportunità della promozione dell'applicazione del GRADE per gli igienisti sia nella veste di proponenti, esperti per gli ambiti tecnico-scientifici di propria competenza e destinatari ""professionali"" delle raccomandazioni, che in qualità di manager e decisori che possono essere coinvolti nei panel (anche su pratiche di non esclusiva pertinenza della sanità pubblica), nonché, naturalmente di metodologi, parte dei team di revisione della letteratura e a supporto dell'utilizzo del metodo stesso che richiede una specifica formazione e competenza. Gli indirizzi sulle LG comprendono anche la fase di implementazione attinente come a partire dalle raccomandazioni prodotte e diffuse si riesce ad incidere sui comportamenti professionali, ovvero colmare il gap tra ricerca e pratica professionale. Questo richiede leadership e facilitazione del giusto mix di interventi (preferibilmente multifattoriali) di supporto al cambiamento (audit & feedback, interventi formativi mirati, processi di consenso locali, uso di strumenti di comunicazione, ecc), calibrati su ostacoli e fattori favorenti l'adozione delle linee guida. L'implementazione di LG promuove la gestione e la condivisione di informazioni, conoscenze e pratiche che favoriscono un approccio trasversale rispetto alle funzioni e ai team di lavoro che promuove l'integrazione (sia all'interno che con l'esterno delle organizzazioni sanitarie) e può assicurare processi decisionali più affidabili ed efficienti. La coerenza tra raccomandazioni per l'ottimizzazione dell'efficacia e altre dimensioni della qualità dell'intervento sanitario (quali sicurezza, accessibilità ed equità) con le esigenze di efficienza e razionalità organizzativa dei servizi configura un importante ancoraggio delle LG al paradigma emergente del valore in sanità. Costruire una sanità basata sul valore implica una chiara analisi del profilo di efficacia degli interventi sanitari e la disponibilità di robusti strumenti valutativi e infrastrutture digitali di supporto alla misurazione accurata e tempestiva dei dati epidemiologici della popolazione, da trasformare in informazioni cliniche rilevanti per integrare e analizzare tutti i passaggi (e i risultati ottenuti) del ciclo di assistenza in oggetto e da correlare costantemente con i costi sostenuti dal sistema sanitario. Massimizzare il valore, ovvero gli esiti prodotti in relazione alle risorse a disposizione, per gli individui e le popolazioni presuppone l'adozione di criteri di finanziamento e di gestione delle risorse (umane e organizzative) e soluzioni tecnologiche che facilitino la costruzione di reti e percorsi, da coniugare con la capacità di tradurre i risultati della ricerca sanitaria e le best practice in raccomandazioni. D'altro canto, la diffusione di pratiche sicure, efficaci e appropriate consente di concorrere in maniera determinante all'uniformità di tassonomia, modelli e comportamenti profes-sionali in contesti decisionali affini, ovvero di contribuire a standardizzare l'operatività dei servizi, aspetto quest'ultimo rilevante nel contesto della sanità pubblica italiana e delle sue articolazioni operative territoriali. L'adozione di linee guida ovviamente presenta anche aspetti di criticità, legati all'effettiva traduzione dei risultati della ricerca e dell'innovazione in comportamenti professionali diffusi e virtuosi; ma anche all'adeguatezza delle LG e dei correlati processi decisionali di fronte a quesiti o target di popolazione per loro natura complessi, come quelli che si incontrano per esempio nel produrre indirizzi che siano effettivamente rispondenti alle esigenze di prevenzione e personalizzazione dell'assistenza del ""paziente complesso"". A ciò vanno aggiunte alcune difficoltà organizzative e professionali che connotano l'odierna fase di avvio della concreta applicazione del metodo GRADE allo sviluppo delle raccomandazioni per la pratica clinica proposto nel ""nuovo Sistema Nazionale Linee Guida"". Per esempio, rispetto alla sanità pubblica, pur esistendo oggi molte LG autorevoli e di diffusa applicazione, queste spesso risultano essere datate e realizzate con meccanismi di consenso e formulazione delle raccomandazioni di tipo tradizionale, rendendo dunque necessari aggiornamenti e adattamenti secondo le menzionate modalità di lavoro proposte a livello nazionale e internazionale per produrre linee guida di alta qualità. Per operare nel quadro della nuova cornice metodologica sulle LG, ai medici e agli altri professionisti sanitari, ai manager e ai policy maker della sanità, al mondo accademico e alle società scientifiche è richiesto un investimento prioritario nella gestione di conoscenze fondate su un approccio scientifico, strutturato e trasparente alla definizione dell'efficacia e dell'appropriatezza degli interventi medici. In questo contesto nazionale, per gli igienisti in collaborazione con tutti gli attori della Sanità Pubblica, è strategico un impegno permanente sulla tematica delle linee guida, da sostenere anche mediante azioni di formazione, condivisione di conoscenza e di comunicazione. Valorizzare l'applicazione critica di strumenti per governare i processi decisionali secondo logiche di partecipazione e fiducia reciproca tra gli stakeholder è fondamentale per il perseguimento degli obiettivi di ottimizzazione della qualità e della sostenibilità nel Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, a beneficio dei cittadini-pazienti e della società nella sua globalità."
Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of canine kobuviruses in diarrhoetic dogs in northeast China,"Canine kobuviruses (CaKVs) are newly recognized picornaviruses that have been recently detected in dogs in the U.S.A., Italy, U.K., the Republic of Korea and Tanzania. To trace the evolution of CaKV strains, a total of 201 fecal samples from rectal swabs of diarrheic dogs, which were obtained from May 2014 to April 2015 in northeast China, were detected by reverse transcription-PCR targeting a partial (504 bp) fragment of the 3D gene. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of the CaKV strains identified in northeast China was conducted based on the partial 3D gene sequence. The results indicated that 36 fecal samples (17.91%, 36/201) were positive for CaKV, in which the co-infection rates of canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus-2 and canine bocavirus were 58.33%, 41.67%, and 11.11%, respectively. Sequence comparison of the partial 3D gene revealed nucleotide homologies of 94.4-100%, 95.6-98.6%, 94.3-97.6%, 94.4-96.3% and 93.3-95.1% within the 36 Chinese CaKV strains, and between the 36 Chinese CaKV strains and four CaKV reference strains from South Korea, Italy, U.S.A. and Tanzania, respectively. A phylogenetic tree revealed that the 36 Chinese CaKV strains formed one specific CaKV lineage with CaKVs that have recently been identified in other countries. The 36 Chinese CaKV strains were closely related to CaKV reference strains from Asia and Europe, but differed genetically from CaKV reference strains from North America and Africa. This study provides evidence that CaKVs circulate in diarrhoetic dogs in China and that they exhibit substantial genetic diversity and high co-infection rates with other enteric viruses.","The family Picornaviridae is highly diverse, currently comprising 17 genera, many of which consist of several species, subspecies and genotypes [1] . Kobuvirus is a newly recognized genus in the family Picornaviridae. Several studies have demonstrated that kobuviruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route via the consumption of contaminated food or water, and they have a potential role in gastroenteritis in humans and animals [2, 8, 11] . Canine kobuviruses (CaKVs) have been recently discovered in dogs [10] , demonstrating that pets can be infected with members of this genus. At present, epidemiological investigations of CaKVs in dogs are important for understanding their pathogenicity and given the interactions between pets and humans, their zoonotic potential."
"Antibody engineering for increased potency, breadth and half-life",This review highlights recent developments in HIV-1 antibody engineering and discusses the effects of increased polyreactivity on serum half-lives of engineered antibodies.,"HIV-1 effectively evades antibody-mediated responses due to rapid mutation of gp120 and gp41, the two glycoproteins that comprise the envelope (Env) spike ( Fig. 1 ], and structural features that enable Env to hide conserved epitopes, including a shield of host-derived carbohydrates [5] , conformational masking [6] , steric occlusion [7] [8] [9] [10] and flexible variable loops [8, 11] . The low number and density of envelope spikes on HIV-1 virions may also contribute to the ability of HIV-1 to evade antibodies by preventing most IgGs from binding simultaneously with both Fabs [12,13 & ]. These features usually result in production of strain-specific antibodies. However, recent advances in single-cell cloning techniques have led to the identification of extremely potent, broadly neutralizing HIV-1 IgG antibodies (bNAbs) from infected donors [14] [15] [16] . When delivered passively in animal models of HIV-1 infection, anti-HIV-1 bNAbs can prevent [17] [18] [19] [20] or suppress infection [21] [22] [23] [24] , prompting efforts to improve their potency and/or breadth in order to increase their efficacy as therapeutics. Characterization of bNAbs through structural and bioinformatic approaches has identified epitopes on HIV-1 Env, including the gp120 V1V2 and V3 loops, the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), the gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER) and sites bridging gp120 and gp41 ( Fig. 1) [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ."
Noise and Room Acoustic Conditions in a Address for correspondence,"Background and Objectives: Noise levels and room acoustic parameters at a tertiary referral hospital, Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) in Korea, are investigated. Materials and Methods: Through a questionnaire, acoustically problematic rooms are identified. Noise levels in emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) are measured over about three days. Acoustically critical and problematic rooms in the otolaryngology department are measured including examination rooms, operating rooms, nurse stations, receptions, and patient rooms. Results: The A-weighted equivalent noise level, LAeq, ranges from 54 to 56 dBA, which is at least 10 dB lower than the noise levels of 65 to 73 dBA measured in American ERs. In an ICU, the noise level for the first night was 66 dBA, which came down to 56 dBA for the next day. The noise levels during three different ear surgeries vary from 57 to 62 dBA, depending on the use of surgical drills and suctions. The noise levels in a patient room is found to be 47 dBA, while the nurse stations and the receptions have high noise levels up to 64 dBA. The reverberation times in an operation room, examination room, and single patient room are found to be below 0.6 s. Conclusions: At SNUH, the nurse stations and receptions were found to be quite noisy. The ERs were quieter than in the previous studies. The measured reverberation times seemed low enough but some other nurse stations and examination rooms were not satisfactory according to the questionnaire. J Audiol Otol 2019;23(2):76-82 KEY WORDS:0 Hospital noise · ER noise · ICU noise · Ear surgery noise · Reverberation time.","Hospitals, in general, are known to be not quiet according to various studies, see for examples . No results satisfied the World Health Organization guidelines for community noise of 35 dBA as (A-weighted equivalent sound pressure level) LAeq, which happens to be the noise limit for hospital rooms where patients are treated and observed [25] . Acoustically most interesting rooms in hospitals are two-fold: rooms where patients need good quality tranquility to focus on healing and rooms where staff needs concentration. Reverberation characteristics influence verbal communication between patients and staff. There is no building legislation for Korean hospitals in terms of reverberation time, but other countries have building regulations, e.g., Danish Building Regulation (BR18) setting a maximum reverberation time of 0.6 s for examination rooms and patient bedrooms in the frequency range of 125-4,000 Hz [26] . As the medical care is absolutely prioritized, hospitals tend to underestimate the importance of acoustics."
Icariin promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by upregulating BMAL1 expression via BMP signaling,"increasing research has demonstrated that expression of brain and muscle arnT-like 1 (BMal1) and other circadian clock genes can be regulated by drugs and toxicants. We previously demonstrated that icariin, extracted from Herba epimedii, sromotes osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMal1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMScs) remains unclear. The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMal1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMScs. The cell counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), runX family transcription factor 2 (runX2), alkaline phosphatase (alP), osteocalcin (oc) and BMal1 in BMScs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative Pcr and western blotting. alP and alizarin red S (arS) staining were also performed. icariin promoted BMSc proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMal1. in addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, runX2, alP and oc were upregulated by BMal1 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that BMal1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMScs. Finally, arS staining of BMal1 -/-BMScs revealed that BMal1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. in conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMal1-BMP2 signaling in BMScs. The present study thus described a novel target of icariin that has potential applications in the treatment of osteogenic disorders.","osteonecrosis of the femoral head (onFH) is a debilitating and progressive disease which can lead to femoral head collapse and subsequent osteoarthritis. This disease is the major cause of total hip arthroplasty in young adults (1) . it is reported that more than 1 million new patients are affected with this disease annually and the annual incidence is 15 to 20 million according to a nationwide survey (2) . accumulating evidence has alluded to several etiologic and pathogenic mechanisms for onFH (3) . The principal mechanism involves interruption of osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMScs) (4) .

Prion Diseases as Transmissible Zoonotic Diseases,"Prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), lead to neurological dysfunction in animals and are fatal. Infectious prion proteins are causative agents of many mammalian TSEs, including scrapie (in sheep), chronic wasting disease (in deer and elk), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; in cattle), and CreutzfeldteJakob disease (CJD; in humans). BSE, better known as mad cow disease, is among the many recently discovered zoonotic diseases. BSE cases were first reported in the United Kingdom in 1986. Variant CJD (vCJD) is a disease that was first detected in 1996, which affects humans and is linked to the BSE epidemic in cattle. vCJD is presumed to be caused by consumption of contaminated meat and other food products derived from affected cattle. The BSE epidemic peaked in 1992 and decreased thereafter; this decline is continuing sharply owing to intensive surveillance and screening programs in the Western world. However, there are still new outbreaks and/or progression of prion diseases, including atypical BSE, and iatrogenic CJD and vCJD via organ transplantation and blood transfusion. This paper summarizes studies on prions, particularly on prion molecular mechanisms, BSE, vCJD, and diagnostic procedures. Risk perception and communication policies of the European Union for the prevention of prion diseases are also addressed to provide recommendations for appropriate government policies in Korea.","Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) is a general term for misfolded proteins, also called prionsrelated diseases, which had been discussed only among a few scientists until bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known to the public as mad cow disease, became a public concern. It became widely known in the 1980s due to a sudden increase in the incidence of BSE in Europe; in the 1990s, it drew people's attention as"
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia as an initial manifestation of hyper-IgM syndrome in an infant A case report,"Rationale: Pneumocystis jirovecii causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, malignancy, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, and primary immune deficiency compose the risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in children, and PCP can be an initial clinical manifestation of primary immune deficiency.","In children, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was mostly reported as epidemics in premature and malnourished infants in the 1940s and 1950s. [1] After then, most cases of PCP developed in children with immunocompromised states, and patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have comprised a majority of patients with PCP since the 1980s. [2] Accordingly, the suspicion and diagnosis of PCP in children without any evidence of an underlying immunocompromised state are not easy. Primary immune deficiency (PID), as well as HIV infection, malignancy, and transplantation, are known as risk factors for PCP, [3] and PCP can be an initial clinical manifestation of PID. [4] [5] [6] We diagnosed a 5-month-old male infant presenting with cyanosis and interstitial pneumonia with PCP. Although he had no previous history consistent with PID, further evaluation revealed X-linked hyper-IgM (HIGM) syndrome, and he received hematopoietic cell transplantation for the underlying HIGM syndrome. This case report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital (Approval No.: KC18ZESI0177). Written informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient's parent."
PEER REVIEW HISTORY,BMJ Open publishes all reviews undertaken for accepted manuscripts. Reviewers are asked to complete a checklist review form (http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/resources/checklist.pdf) and are provided with free text boxes to elaborate on their assessment. These free text comments are reproduced below.,"Manuscript title: Protocol for a randomised, single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group controlled trial of the efficacy of rhinothermy delivered by nasal high flow therapy in the treatment of the common cold Summary Thanks for the opportunity to review this manuscript. It is an interesting and well-reported study protocol plan to undertake a definitive, adequately powered RCT to investigate the effectiveness of nasal high flow rhinothermy treatment in the management of the common cold. A pilot of 30 patients (also published in BMJ Open) demonstrated this study is feasible and enabled an accurate power calculation. It is important because the current evidence (summarised well in a Cochrane review) leaves the efficacy of heated, humified air for the common cold uncertain, recommending more high-quality randomised trials. Although this is industry-funded, the arrangement appears to be arms-length, with no representation of the company listed among the authors. The RCT has elements of both a pragmatic trial (something that could be delivered immediately to people suffering colds, should it prove effective), as well as interpretive (by excluding patients with influenza virus -which will not be practical in most settings. However, interpreting this should be possible by examining the numbers excluded. Minor issues 1-Blinding is a potential issue if patients can detect whether they have the higher temperature humidified air. Accordingly, might it be worth asking patients to guess which arm they were in at Day 14, so that breaking of blinding can be assessed. 2-It is probably worth providing details about how important future protocol amendments will be communicated. Please leave your comments for the authors below This is a well-planned study protocol. which may lead to a low risk of bias. As an outcome, one can add measurement of viral load, the weight of the nasal secretions and rhinomanometry Answer: Thank you for raising these questions. In terms of viral load, in view of the diversity of viruses which can cause the common cold we decided not to measure viral load as part of this study. Although this would be interesting, it would be burdensome and expensive for this study. We are however analysing nasopharyngeal specimens obtained on Day 1 from participants who are enrolled in the cold study, in order to isolate their causative viruses for descriptive purposes (as listed as a tertiary outcome in the protocol manuscript). As up to 2/3 of colds are caused by human rhinovirus, we intend to perform an interaction analysis to assess evidence that there are different treatment outcomes for those participants who test positive for HRV."
ITRACONAZOLE INHIBITS ENTEROVIRUS REPLICATION BY TARGETING THE OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN HHS Public Access,"Itraconazole (ITZ) is a well-known antifungal agent that also has anti-cancer activity. In this study, we identified ITZ as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus-71, rhinovirus). We demonstrate that ITZ inhibits viral RNA replication by targeting oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related protein 4 (ORP4). Consistently, OSW-1, a specific OSBP/ORP4 antagonist, also inhibits enterovirus replication. Knockdown of OSBP inhibits virus replication whereas overexpression of OSBP or ORP4 counteracts the antiviral effects of ITZ and OSW-1. ITZ binds OSBP and inhibits its function, i.e. shuttling of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate between membranes, thereby likely perturbing the virus-induced membrane alterations essential for viral replication organelle formation. ITZ also inhibits hepatitis C virus replication, which also relies on OSBP. Together, these data implicate OSBP/ORP4 as novel molecular targets of ITZ and point to an essential role of OSBP/ORP4-mediated lipid exchange in virus replication that can be targeted by antiviral drugs.","The family Picornaviridae contains many important human and animal pathogens. The genus Enterovirus includes poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus (CV), echovirus, several numbered enteroviruses (e.g. enterovirus-71, EV71) and human rhinovirus (HRV). Except for PV, no vaccines are available to prevent infections with enteroviruses and no antiviral drugs are available for treatment. Other important human picornaviruses include hepatitis A virus and human parechovirus (HPeV). Well-known animal pathogens are foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)."
SIRT7-dependent deacetylation of CDK9 activates RNA polymerase II transcription,"SIRT7 is an NAD + -dependent protein deacetylase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. Previous studies have shown that SIRT7 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and pre-rRNA processing. Here, we took a proteomic approach to identify novel molecular targets and characterize the role of SIRT7 in non-nucleolar processes. We show that SIRT7 interacts with numerous proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, the majority of interactions requiring ongoing transcription. In addition to its role in Pol I transcription, we found that SIRT7 also regulates transcription of snoRNAs and mRNAs. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, which activates transcription by phosphorylating serine 2 within the Cterminal domain (CTD) of Pol II. SIRT7 counteracts GCN5-directed acetylation of lysine 48 within the catalytic domain of CDK9, deacetylation promoting CTD phosphorylation and transcription elongation.","Studies over the past decade have shown that sirtuins, members of a phylogenetically conserved protein family that shares homology to the budding yeast silencing factor Sir2 (silent information regulator), affect a broad range of cellular functions encompassing cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. The seven mammalian sirtuins, denoted SIRT1-SIRT7, have distinct cellular locations and target multiple substrates. By utilizing NAD + as cofactor, sirtuins act either as deacety-lases or ADP-ribosyltransferases, and have emerged as key metabolic sensors that link environmental signals to metabolic homeostasis and stress response. SIRT7 is enriched in nucleoli, where it promotes cell growth and proliferation by driving rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis (1) . SIRT7 expression correlates with cell growth, being high in metabolically active cells, and low or even absent in non-proliferating cells (1) (2) (3) (4) . In epithelial prostate carcinomas, high SIRT7 levels are associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, metastatic disease and poor patient prognosis (5) . High expression of SIRT7 is steadily propelling cells towards an oncogenic status. Depletion of SIRT7 or overexpression of a catalytically inactive point mutant leads to decreased cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and reduced tumor growth (6) . SIRT7-knockout mice suffer from increased embryonic lethality, reduced stress resistance, inflammatory cardiomyopathy and premature aging (7) (8) (9) (10) . Moreover, SIRT7 catalyzes deacetylation of lysine 18 at histone H3 (H3K18ac), a biomarker of aggressive tumors. Hypoacetylation of H3K18 compromises transcription of genes that are linked to tumor suppression and facilitates DNA repair (10, 11) ."
Shrinkage of Genome Size in a Plant RNA Virus upon Transfer of an Essential Viral Gene into the Host Genome,"Nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses (NIRVs) are genes of nonretroviral RNA viruses found in the genomes of many eukaryotic organisms. NIRVs are thought to sometimes confer virus resistance, meaning that they could impact spread of the virus in the host population. However, a NIRV that is expressed may also impact the evolution of virus populations within host organisms. Here, we experimentally addressed the evolution of a virus in a host expressing a NIRV using Tobacco etch virus (TEV), a plant RNA virus, and transgenic tobacco plants expressing its replicase, NIb. We found that a virus missing the NIb gene, TEV-ÁNIb, which is incapable of autonomous replication in wild-type plants, had a higher fitness than the full-length TEV in the transgenic plants. Moreover, when the full-length TEV was evolved by serial passages in transgenic plants, we observed genomic deletions within NIb-and in some cases the adjacent cistrons-starting from the first passage. When we passaged TEV and TEV-ÁNIb in transgenic plants, we found mutations in proteolytic sites, but these only occurred in TEV-ÁNIb lineages, suggesting the adaptation of polyprotein processing to altered NIb expression. These results raise the possibility that NIRV expression can indeed induce the deletion of the corresponding genes in the viral genome, resulting in the formation of viruses that are replication defective in hosts that do not express the same NIRV. Moreover, virus genome evolution was contingent upon the deletion of the viral replicase, suggesting NIRV expression could also alter patterns of virus evolution.","The genome size of RNA viruses is highly variable, ranging from less than 4 kb for members of the Narnaviridae to more than 30 kb for some Coronaviridae. However, most RNA viruses have genome sizes in the 5-15-kb range (Holmes 2009 ). What could explain this wide range of genome sizes in RNA viruses? Small genomes probably replicate faster than large ones, while genome size limits enzymatic complexity. This limited complexity results in lower-fidelity replication enzymes, which in turn leads to higher variability (Smith and Szathmá ry 1995) . On the other hand, larger genomes will replicate more slowly, while being less constrained in the complexity of the proteins they code for. Therefore, larger genomes allow for evolutionary innovations such as polymerases with greater replication fidelity (Denison et al. 2011) or the modulation of host immune responses (Shackelton and Holmes 2004) . However, the evolution of larger genomes and greater complexity may be impeded by Eigen's paradox: to obtain proofreading activity, an RNA virus must already have a large genome (Eigen 1971; Smith and Szathmá ry 1995) . It has therefore been suggested that RNA virus genome size evolves to the upper limit imposed by mutation rate (Swetina and Schuster 1982) ."
NOTE A long-term animal experiment indicating persistent infection of bovine coronavirus in cattle,"A long-term animal experiment involving inoculation with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was conducted to verify its persistent infection in cattle. Three colostrum-deprived Holstein calves were housed separately in individual rooms of a high-containment facility and inoculated with the BCoV strain Kumamoto/1/07. Until the end of the experiment (1,085, 700 and 280 days, respectively), viral RNAs were detected sporadically by RT-PCR and nested PCR from plasma, nasal discharge, and feces. Seroconversion and titer changes were validated by hemagglutination inhibition tests and neutralization tests. Among the samples, nasal discharge showed a higher viral positivity than feces, which seemed to be associated with positive detection in the plasma. These data demonstrate the existence of persistent infection of BCoV in the respiratory tissues of cattle.","Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a member of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, species Betacoronavirus-1. This species also includes Human coronavirus OC43, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, Equine coronavirus, and Canine respiratory coronavirus [1] ."
Infrared thermal imaging in connective tissue diseases,"Infrared thermal imaging (IRT) is a non-invasive, non-contact technique which allows one to measure and visualize infrared radiation. In medicine, thermal imaging has been used for more than 50 years in various clinical settings, including Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis. Imaging and quantification of surface body temperature provides an indirect measure of the microcirculation's overall performance. As such, IRT is capable of confirming the diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, and, with additional cold or heat challenge, of differentiating between the primary and secondary condition. In systemic sclerosis IRT has a potential role in assessing disease activity and monitoring treatment response. Despite certain limitations, thermal imaging can find a place in clinical practice, and with the introduction of small, low-cost infrared cameras, possibly become a part of routine rheumatological evaluation.","Infrared thermal imaging (infrared thermography, IRT) is a non-invasive technique which allows one to measure and visualize infrared (IR) radiation. Prototype IR devices were developed by the military during and after the Second World War. In the late 1950s, IR technology was made available for industry and civilian science. At the turn of the century, thanks to steady technological progress, the bulky IR cameras with liquid nitrogen cooling were replaced by portable, commercially available devices. This led to more widespread use of IRT in diverse fields of science, including medicine. This review will explore the current and possible future applications of IRT in diagnostics of Raynaud's phenomenon and related connective tissue diseases."
The RNA Virus Database,"The RNA Virus Database is a database and web application describing the genome organization and providing analytical tools for the 938 known species of RNA virus. It can identify submitted nucleotide sequences, can place them into multiple whole-genome alignments (in species where more than one isolate has been fully sequenced) and contains translated genome sequences for all species. It has been created for two main purposes: to facilitate the comparative analysis of RNA viruses and to become a hub for other, more specialised virus Web sites. It is available at the following four mirrored sites.","Viruses are divided into two similar-sized groups depending on whether the virus particle contains DNA or RNA, and, as causes of human fatality, RNA viruses are by far the more important (1) . New viral diseases continue to appear as a result of several changes in human activity: travel, population growth, interaction with wild habitats etc. Well-known novel, or emergent, RNA diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (3), and may come to include Avian influenza H5N1 virus (4) . These emergent diseases are an important factor behind the increase in the number of genome sequences that NCBI treats as representing new species (Figure 1 ). In 2005, more than 200 new virus species were submitted to GenBank (more recent dates are less reliable because there is typically a delay between submission and public availability). As more emergent viruses appear, it is important to have a site that allows their genomes to be compared to those of known viruses. The origin of most major infectious diseases is unknown because of our ignorance of the diversity of pathogens in wild animals. This restricts our ability to both predict risks and develop treatments (5) ."
Treatment strategies for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance, has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1600 people, resulting in almost 600 deaths. The high case fatality rate, growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined epidemiology of this novel pathogen have created an urgent need for effective public health countermeasures, including safe and effective treatment strategies. Despite the relatively few numbers of cases to date, research and development of MERS-CoV therapeutic candidates is advancing quickly. This review surveys the landscape of these efforts and assesses their potential for use in affected populations.","Respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of mortality in resource-limited settings, accounting for more than 4 million deaths each year globally [1] . Epidemic-and pandemic-prone respiratory viruses are the aetiological pathogens in many cases, and have caused several of the most prominent infectious disease outbreaks of the past two decades: these include H5N1 influenza in 1997, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009. Most recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a novel cause of severe acute respiratory illness after first being identified in a Saudi Arabian patient in 2012 [2] . Although initially restricted to the Arabian Peninsula, this emerging pathogen has respectively infected and killed more than 1600 and 580 people on four continents across 26 countries [3, 4] . Phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV [5] , MERS-CoV has a similar clinical presentation [6] [7] [8] [9] , albeit with a higher case fatality rate (~40% versus 10%) [3] [4] [5] . Dromedary camels serve as the principal animal reservoir for this virus; and zoonotic spillover from dromedaries to humans has, thus far, driven the course of the epidemic [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although humanto-human transmission has been documented -particularly in the context of nosocomial outbreaks [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] -the spread of MERS-CoV is inefficient and unsustained, as reflected in an estimated reproduction rate of no higher than 0.7 [25, 26] . MERS-CoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that comprises a 30-kilobase genome that codes for four structural proteins and an RNA polymerase [27] , typical of the Coronaviridae family ( Figure 1 ). The most immunogenic of these proteins is the virus' only surface glycoprotein, Spike (S) [28] [29] [30] that mediates viral attachment and fusion via the host cognate receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [31] . Although the broad principles of the virus' life cycle and its mechanisms of pathogenesis are beginning to be understood, this knowledge has not yet translated to a licensed therapy or vaccine. Much of the work to develop safe and effective MERS-CoV countermeasures has centred on vaccines, but the relatively low prevalence of the disease, the sporadic nature of the case clusters and the dearth of detailed knowledge on chains of transmission highlight the need for greater investments into the discovery of effective therapeutic and secondary prophylactic regimens for infected and exposed individuals."
In Vitro Analysis of the Oligodendrocyte Lineage in Mice during Demyelination and Remyelination,A demyelinating disease induced in Dr. Friedrich's current address is Brookdale,"C57B1/6N mice by intracranial injection of a coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus strain A59) is followed by functional recovery and efficient CNS myelin repair. To study the biological properties of the cells involved in this repair process, glial ceils were isolated and cultured from spinal cords of these young adult mice during demyelination and remyelination. Using three-color immunofluorescence combined with [3H]thymidine autoradiography, we have analyzed the antigenic phenotype and mitotic potential of individual glial cells. We identified oligodendrocytes with an antibody to galactocerebroside, astrocytes with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein, and oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells with the 04 antibody. Cultures from demyelinated tissue differed in several ways from those of agematched controls: first, the total number of O-2A lin-cage cells was strikingly increased; second, the O-2A population consisted of a higher proportion of 04positive astrocytes and cells of mixed oligodendrocyteastrocyte phenotype; and third, all the cell types within the O-2A lineage showed enhanced proliferation. This proliferation was not further enhanced by adding PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to the defined medium. However, bFGF and IGF-I seemed to influence the fate of O-2A lineage cells in cultures of demyelinated tissue. Basic FGF decreased the percentage of cells expressing galactocerebroside. In contrast, IGF-I increased the relative proportion of oligodendrocytes. Thus, O-2A lineage cells from adult mice display greater phenotypic plasticity and enhanced mitotic potential in response to an episode of demyelination. These properties may be linked to the efficient remyelination achieved in this demyelinating disease. I ~ demyelinating diseases, damage to myelin sheaths disrupts conduction of electrical impulses along axonal processes of neurons. Typically, damaged myelin is not efficiently repaired in the human CNS (Perier and Gregoire, 1965; Prineas et al., 1984) . Thus patients with CNS demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, frequently experience prolonged neurological dysfunction. In contrast, efficient remyelination and functional recovery is achieved in rodents in certain experimental models of CNS demyelination (reviewed in Ludwin, 1981) . One such model is produced by infecting C57B1/6N mice with a coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus strain A59; MHV-A59), which leads to the development of multiple CNS demyelinating lesions (Lavi et al., 1984; Jordan et al., 1989) . This coronavirus replicates in glial cells during an early phase of the disease and is subsequently cleared from the CNS (Jordan et al., 1989) . Infected mice exhibit clinical signs of CNS demyelin-ation within the first week post infection (wpi)? By 3-5 wpi, focal areas of demyelination are present throughout the CNS, with prominent lesions in the spinal cord. In the following weeks, remyelination is paralleled by functional recovery. Using this model, we can analyze the processes involved in regeneration of the cells that form CNS myelin."
Asthma associated with denatonium benzoate in a healthcare worker in Taiwan A case report,"Rationale: Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable.","Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure. [1] During the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan in 2003, [2] a significant number of the infected subjects were healthcare workers (HCWs) who contracted the SARS infection from their patients. For the prevention of airborne infections, many HCWs in hospitals have been fit tested for respirator use as a part of respiratory protection programs since 2003. [2, 3] The main purpose of fit testing is to ensure that the respirator being used by the individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect the person from unwanted airborne hazard exposures. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. [3] Under these circumstances, the health consequences for individuals given denatonium benzoate become an important issue. We report a case that required hospitalization for a severe asthmatic reaction related to denatonium benzoate fit testing."
"Antiviral and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Pochonin D, a Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitor, against Rhinovirus Infection","Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are one of the major causes of common cold in humans and are also associated with acute asthma and bronchial illness. Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, is an important host factor for the replication of single-strand RNA viruses. In the current study, we examined the effect of the Hsp90 inhibitor pochonin D, in vitro and in vivo, using a murine model of human rhinovirus type 1B (HRV1B) infection. Our data suggested that Hsp90 inhibition significantly reduced the inflammatory cytokine production and lung damage caused by HRV1B infection. The viral titer was significantly lowered in HRV1B-infected lungs and in Hela cells upon treatment with pochonin D. Infiltration of innate immune cells including granulocytes and monocytes was also reduced in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by pochonin D treatment after HRV1B infection. Histological analysis of the lung and respiratory tract showed that pochonin D protected the mice from HRV1B infection. Collectively, our results suggest that the Hsp90 inhibitor, pochonin D, could be an attractive antiviral therapeutic for treating HRV infection.","Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are positive single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Piconaviridae. HRV infection in humans usually causes common cold and mild illnesses, but is sometimes associated with asthma exacerbation and viral upper respiratory tract infection (Bartlett et al., 2008) . HRVs are divided into three distinct species including type A, type B, and type C, with over 100 immunologically noncross reactive HRV serotypes (Park et al., 2012) . Among the HRV serotypes, the majority accounting for 90%, use human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their cellular receptor and do not bind mouse ICAM-1, whereas the remaining 10% of the minor serotypes including HRV1B use a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL-1) receptor family and can bind the mouse counterpart (Bartlett et al., 2008) . Thus, HRV1B is thought to be a suitable model for murine infection."
"Recode-2: new design, new search tools, and many more genes","Recoding' is a term used to describe non-standard read-out of the genetic code, and encompasses such phenomena as programmed ribosomal frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, selenocysteine insertion and translational bypassing. Although only a small proportion of genes utilize recoding in protein synthesis, accurate annotation of 'recoded' genes lags far behind annotation of 'standard' genes. In order to address this issue, provide a service to researchers in the field, and offer training data for developers of gene-annotation software, we have gathered together known cases of recoding within the Recode database. Recode-2 is an improved and updated version of the database. It provides access to detailed information on genes known to utilize translational recoding and allows complex search queries, browsing of recoding data and enhanced visualization of annotated sequence elements. At present, the Recode-2 database stores information on approximately 1500 genes that are known to utilize recoding in their expression-a factor of approximately three increase over the previous version of the database. Recode-2 is available at","The term 'translational recoding' describes the utilization of non-standard decoding during protein synthesis and encompasses such processes as ribosomal frameshifting, codon redefinition, translational bypassing and StopGo (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . What is often considered as a decoding error-e.g. a frameshifting error or mistranslation of a particular codon-may occasionally benefit the organism by increasing its fitness and survival. In such instances the propensity for the decoding 'error' may be selected for during evolution, leading to the formation of a particular sequence context that elevates the frequency of the 'error'. To discriminate such cases of programmed decoding 'misbehaviour' from promiscuous translational errors or translational noise, the term recoding is used. The position within an mRNA where a recoding event takes place is termed the 'recoding site'. Sequence elements responsible for increasing the efficiency of recoding events are termed 'recoding stimulatory signals', and a minimal sequence fragment that allows recoding to take place at the natural efficiency (i.e. relative to the level of standard decoding at the recoding site) is termed a 'recoding cassette'."
Three cases of idiopathic eosinophilic enteritis with chronic obstinate diarrhea in Japanese Black fattening cattle,"Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease and is characterized clinically by chronic obstinate diarrhea. Three Japanese Black (JB) fattening cattle (2 males and 1 female) on different cattle farms presented with chronic episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration. Soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1−3 cm) were occasionally excreted within the diarrheic feces. Administration of antibiotics, antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides had no therapeutic effect, but dexamethasone improved the fecal characteristics. The symptoms persisted until the animals were slaughtered at 27-30 months of age. Histopathological examination of the intestines revealed marked eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa. From these findings, we diagnosed these cattle as the first cases of EOE in Jb cattle. KEY WORDS: eosinophilic enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Japanese Black cattle","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of idiopathic, chronic gastrointestinal tract disorders characterized by infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract by inflammatory cells that are generally confined to the mucosa, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils and eosinophils [6] . IBD is a common disease characterized by persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and weight loss, in certain animal species and humans [6, 7] . Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is part of the IBD complex and is a morphological diagnosis characterized by inflammation in which eosinophilic leucocytes predominate [1] , with clinical signs typified by chronic obstinate diarrhea. It is a minor cause of IBD in humans [6, 11] , dogs [10] , cats [4, 5] and horses [1, 8, 9] ; however, few cases of EOE in cattle have been reported [2] . This research group previously reported 4 cases of idiopathic EOE in cattle, aged 1 (Angus heifer), 5 (Simmental bull), 7 (Holstein cow) and 11 (Holstein cow) years old, diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other differential diagnoses for cattle with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. However, to the best of our knowledge, neither the occurrence of EOE in Japanese black (Jb) cattle nor the associated clinical symptoms from the first appearance of their symptoms after purchase or birth to completion of their fattening periods (approximately 30 months of age) have been reported thus far."
Gene Expression Detection Assay for Cancer Clinical Use,"Cancer is a genetic disease where genetic variations cause abnormally functioning genes that appear to alter expression. Proteins, the final products of gene expression, determine the phenotypes and biological processes. Therefore, detecting gene expression levels can be used for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment prediction in a clinical setting. In this review, we investigated six gene expression assay systems (qRT-PCR, DNA microarray, nCounter, RNA-Seq, FISH, and tissue microarray) that are currently being used in clinical cancer studies. Some of these methods are also commonly used in a modified way; for example, detection of DNA content or protein expression. Herein, we discuss their principles, sample preparation, design, quantification and sensitivity, data analysis, time for sample preparation and processing, and cost. We also compared these methods according to their sample selection, particularly for the feasibility of using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which are routinely archived for clinical cancer studies. We intend to provide a guideline for choosing an assay method with respect to its oncological applications in a clinical setting.","It is generally accepted that driver gene mutations initialize cancer development. Protooncogenes, such as Ras, are transcribed into products such as receptors, growth factors, transcription factors, and signaling enzymes for cellular proliferation. 1 Gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogenes, resulting in dominant oncogenes that differ from their proto-oncogenes or are over-expressed, occur by point mutations, localized reduplication, or chromosomal translocation. An oncogene therefore disrupts a cell's normal activity and can lead to uncontrolled cell division, and ultimately cancerous cells. Genes for the inhibition of cell growth are termed tumor-suppressor genes and include APC and TP53; the loss or under-expression of these genes also results in an uncontrolled cell division. 1, 2 Therefore, by analyzing gene expression levels and the biological pathways associated with the genes involved in a cancer, one can study the difference between normal cell and cancerous cell pathways to determine the genetic origin of the faulty pathway, thereby identifying potential targets for treating cancer. The potential subtypes of that cancer can be identified through class discovery, the identification of novel cancer subtypes, and class prediction, the assignment of tumor samples to pre-defined classes in order to aid in predicting the outcome. 3 Gene expression analysis also allows for biomarker and gene signature discovery. The use of gene expression profiling and development of gene biomarkers/ signatures for cancer allows for the diagnosis, progression and aggressiveness analyses, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic treatment, and/or Ivyspring International Publisher identification of patients who would benefit from therapeutic treatment to better understand the disease and its biology. 4 Various assay technologies have been developed for gene expression analysis (Fig 1) . For example, qRT-PCR amplifies a gene of interest and uses fluorescent probes or dyes to depict the gene expression; NanoString nCounter uses probe pairs to anneal to a region of RNA and detect genes; DNA microarrays allow cDNA targets to hybridize to probes on a solid slide and can use fluorescence to detect genes; Illumina MiSeq RNA-Seq bridge amplifies nucleic acid samples to create clusters, which are then interpreted by the MiSeq system; and lastly, tissue microarrays (TMAs) study circular punches from tissue sample blocks with labelled probes or antibodies to determine the gene expression. Each of these assays has been used in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment prediction for a variety of cancers. Some assays have been commercialized for clinical cancer use. For example, Afirma® is a microarray test for thyroid cancer diagnosis and the Oncotype DX qRT-PCR test is for guiding breast cancer treatment. Many assays are under investigation in clinical trials or studies."
The Emergence of Human Coronavirus EMC: How Scared Should We Be?,"A novel betacoronavirus, human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC), has recently been detected in humans with severe respiratory disease. Further characterization of HCoV-EMC suggests that this virus is different from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) because it is able to replicate in multiple mammalian cell lines and it does not use angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 as a receptor to achieve infection. Additional research is urgently needed to better understand the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of this virus in humans. In their recent study published in mBio, Kindler et al. shed some light on these important topics (E. Kindler, H. R. Jónsdóttir, M. Muth, O. J. Hamming, R. Hartmann, R. Rodriguez, R. Geffers, R. A. Fouchier, C. Drosten, M. A. Müller, R. Dijkman, and V. Thiel, mBio 4[1]:e00611-12, 2013). These authors report the use of differentiated pseudostratified human primary airway epithelial cells, an in vitro model with high physiological relevance to the human airway epithelium, to characterize the cellular tropism of HCoV-EMC. More importantly, the authors demonstrate the potential use of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) to control viral infection. Citation Chan RWY, Poon LLM. 2013. The emergence of human coronavirus EMC: how scared should we be? mBio 4(2):e00191-13.","I n late 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) crossed the species barrier from animals to humans. SARS first struck in Guangdong Province, China, and was officially recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2003. After its introduction into human populations in Hong Kong in February 2003, the virus spread across the globe within weeks. A number of superspreading events occurred in several health care settings during the epidemic. When SARS was declared to have been contained (5 July 2003) , there were 8,098 confirmed SARS cases, and 774 of these patients died from the disease. After this catastrophic event, one of the most frequently asked questions was whether SARS would come back."
Microsomal Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Is Localized to the Endoplasmic Reticulum via Its Carboxyl-Terminal 35 Amino Acids,"Rat microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH) has no amino-terminal signal sequence, but instead it has a characteristic hydrophobic domain at the carboxyl terminus (Miyauehi, K., R. Masaki, S. Taketani, A. Yamamoto, A. Akayama, and Y. Tashiro. 1991. J. Biol. Chem. 266:19536-19542). This membrane-bound enzyme is a useful model protein for studying posttranslational localization to its final destination. When expressed from eDNA in COS-1 cells, wild-type msALDH is localized exclusively in the well-developed ER. The removal of the hydrophobic","domain results in the cytosolic localization of truncated proteins, thus suggesting that the portion is responsible for membrane anchoring. The last 35 amino acids of msALDH, including the hydrophobic domain, are sufficient for targeting of E. coli ~5-galactosidase to the ER membrane. Further studies using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion proteins suggest that two hydrophilie sequences on either side of the hydrophobic domain play an important role in ER targeting."
Differentiated human airway organoids to assess infectivity of emerging influenza virus,"Novel reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus cause human infections, while avian H7N2 and swine H1N1 virus mainly infect birds and pigs, respectively. There is no robust in vitro model for assessing the infectivity of emerging viruses in humans. Based on a recently established method, we generated long-term expanding 3D human airway organoids which accommodate four types of airway epithelial cells: ciliated, goblet, club, and basal cells. We report differentiation conditions which increase ciliated cell numbers to a nearly physiological level with synchronously beating cilia readily discernible in every organoid. In addition, the differentiation conditions induce elevated levels of serine proteases, which are essential for productive infection of human influenza viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We also established improved 2D monolayer culture conditions for the differentiated airway organoids. To demonstrate the ability of differentiated airway organoids to identify human-infective virus, 3D and 2D differentiated airway organoids are applied to evaluate two pairs of viruses with known distinct infectivity in humans, H7N9/Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus an H1N1 strain isolated from swine (H1N1sw). The humaninfective H7N9/Ah virus replicated more robustly than the poorly human-infective H7N2 virus; the highly human-infective H1N1pdm virus replicated to a higher titer than the counterpart H1N1sw. Collectively, we developed differentiated human airway organoids which can morphologically and functionally simulate human airway epithelium. These differentiated airway organoids can be applied for rapid assessment of the infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses to human. airway organoid | proximal differentiation | influenza virus | infectivity","Novel reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus cause human infections, while avian H7N2 and swine H1N1 virus mainly infect birds and pigs, respectively.

These differentiated airway organoids can be applied for rapid assessment of the infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses to human. airway organoid | proximal differentiation | influenza virus | infectivity I nfluenza A viruses (IAVs) can infect a diversity of avian and mammalian species, including humans, and have the remarkable capacity to evolve and adapt to new hosts (1) . The segmented RNA genomes of IAVs and the low fidelity of RNA polymerase allow antigenic shift and drift, which drive the viral evolution. Thus, novel viruses from birds and pigs cross the species barrier and infect humans, leading to sporadic infections, epidemics, and even pandemics (1, 2) . Despite the tremendous progress made in virology and epidemiology, which subtype or strain of IAV will cause the next outbreak remains unpredictable. A novel reassortant H7N9 influenza virus from poultry has led to recurrent outbreaks of human infection in China since 2013 (2, 3) . More than 1,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 human infections were reported by October 2017, with a case-fatality rate higher than 35% (4). In 2009, the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century was caused by a novel pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm), which originated via multiple reassortments of ""classical"" swine H1N1 virus with human H3N2 virus, avian virus, and avian-like swine virus (5). While swine viruses infect humans only sporadically, this novel strain of swine-derived H1N1pdm virus has infected a large proportion of the human population, establishing sustained human-to-human transmission and circulating globally as a seasonal virus strain since then."
Molecular Characterization of Two Human Autoantigens: Unique cDNAs Encoding 95-and 160-kD Proteins of a Putative Family in the Golgi Complex,"Serum autoantibodies from a patient with autoantibodies directed against the Golgi complex were used to screen clones from a HepG2 XZ_ap cDNA library. Three related clones, designated SY2, SY10, and SYll, encoding two distinct polypeptides were purified for further analysis. Antibodies affinity purified by adsorption to the XZ_ap-cloned recombinant proteins and antibodies from NZW rabbits immunized with purified recombinant proteins reproduced Golgi staining and bound two different proteins, 95 and 160 kD, from whole cell extracts. The SYll protein was provisionally named golgin-95 and the SY2/SY10 protein was named golgin-160. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone of SY2 and SYll represented 58.7-and 70-kD proteins of 568 and 620 amino acids. The in vitro translation products of SY2 and SYll cDNAs migrated in SDS-PAGE at 65 and 95 kD, respectively. The in vitro translated proteins were immunoprecipitated by human anti-Golgi serum or immune rabbit serum, but not by normal human serum or preimmune rabbit serum. Features of the cDNA suggested that SY11 was a full-length clone encoding golgin-95 but SY2 and SY10 together encoded a partial sequence of golgin-160. Analysis of the SY11 recombinant protein identified a leucine zipper spanning positions 419-455, a glutamic acid-rich tract spanning positions 322-333, and a proline-rich tract spanning positions 67-73. A search of the SwissProt data bank indicated sequence similarity of SYll to human restin, the heavy chain of kinesin, and the heavy chain of myosin. SY2 shared sequence similarity with the heavy chain of myosin, the USO1 transport protein from yeast, and the 150-kD cytoplasmic dynein-associated polypeptide. Sequence analysis demonstrated that golgin-95 and golgin-160 share 43% sequence similarity and, therefore, may be functionally related proteins.","H uman autoantibodies have proven to be useful reagents in elucidating the structure and function of eucaryotic organelhs. For example, naturally occurring autoantibodies have been used to identify and clone chromatin, nucleolar, nuclear envelope, and cytoplasmic proteins (reviewed in references 1-3). Antibodies directed against the Golgi complex have been reported in the sera of patients with SLE (4), Sj6gren's syndrome and other systemic rheumatic diseases (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) , idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (10) , paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (11) , and viral infections, including the EBV (12) , and HIV (13) .

Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes,"Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease.","We are currently faced with a potential global epidemic of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people in China and is spreading rapidly around the world. In the end of January 2020, the WHO has declared it a global emergency (WHO, 2020) . The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first isolated in Wuhan China, has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and 2003. The virus is a SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), and it is genetically associated with SARSr-CoV strains that infect bats in China . It causes severe respiratory illness, which the WHO recently named COVID-19 disease. It has high fatality rate , can be transmitted from person to person, has infected over 70,000 individuals and has spread to over 30 countries in less than two months (WHO, 2020) . This coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented; so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it. They have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously. This has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics, the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response. Here, we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort. The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify, assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes. The tool also identifies changes at nucleotides, coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 : Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool assembles genomes from next generation sequencing (NGS) in FASTAQ format or assembled genomes in FASTA format. A user can submit up to 1Gb of NGS data or 2,000 assembled genomic sequences. For each assembled genomic sequence, the tool identifies the virus species, constructs a phylogenetic tree and identifies phylogenetic clusters, which includes the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan China in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). The tool identifies changes at nucleotides, coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner and display all of the mutations in detailed tables and reports. . To this reference dataset, we added 47 whole genomes of the current Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org) together with annotation of its original location, collection date and originating and submitting laboratory. The SARS-CoV-2 data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this paper and detailed information is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The 431 reference WGS were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) . The alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences (CDS). A Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed in PhyML (Guidon & Gascuel 2003; Lemoine et al., 2018 ) and a Bayesian tree using MrBayes (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) were constructed. The trees were visualized in Figtree (Rambaut 2018). We selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster (with bootstrap support of 100% and posterior probability of 1). We identified five well supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of SARSr-CoV and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool. Cluster 1 included SARS strains from the 2002 and 2003 Asian outbreaks. In our tool, we named this cluster SARS-CoV Outbreak 2000s but may rename it as SARS-A if a new proposed naming system for SARSr-Cov is adopted in the near future (Rambaut 2020). Cluster 2 (provisionally named as SARS related CoV) includes 7 sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks. Cluster 3 (named as Bat SARS-CoV HKU3) includes three WGS sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus (i.e. Chinese rufous horseshoe bats). Cluster 4 (Bat SARS-CoV ZXC21/ZC45) includes two SARSr-CoV sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus bats in Zhoushan, China. Cluster 5 (virus named SARS-CoV-2 by the ICTV committee and disease named COVID-19 by the WHO) includes three public sequences from the outbreak. We identified this cluster with many sequences from GISAID but kept only three ones as these were the first GenBank sequences. The first whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 was kindly shared by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang and colleagues in the virological.org website. Detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets are available in Supplementary Table 2. The phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated Coronavirus Typing Tool using the Genome Detective framework (Vilsker et al., 2019 , Fonseca et al., 2019 . To determine the accuracy of this tool, each of the 431 test WGS was considered for evaluation (i.e. 384 reference sequences from VIPR and 47 public SARS-CoV-2 sequences). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of Classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps. The first step enables virus species assignments and the second, which is restricted to SARSr-CoV, includes phylogenetic analysis. The first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to BLAST and AGA analysi. AGA is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from NCBI RefSeq Virus Database. AGA (Deforche 2017 ) expands the optimal alignment algorithms of Smith-Waterman (Smith & Waterman 1981) and Gotoh (Gotoh 1982 ) based on an induction state with additional parameters. The result is a more accurate aligner, as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels. In the second step, a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the MAFFT software (Katoh & Standley 2013) . In addition, a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP* (Swofford) . The query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support >70%. If the bootstrap support is <70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned."
Modulation of HIV-1 Gag/Gag-Pol frameshifting by tRNA abundance,"A hallmark of translation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a -1 programmed ribosome frameshifting event that produces the Gag-Pol fusion polyprotein. The constant Gag to Gag-Pol ratio is essential for the virion structure and infectivity. Here we show that the frameshifting efficiency is modulated by Leu-tRNA Leu that reads the UUA codon at the mRNA slippery site. This tRNA Leu isoacceptor is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. When UUA decoding is delayed, the frameshifting follows an alternative route, which maintains the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio constant. A second potential slippery site downstream of the first one is normally inefficient but can also support -1-frameshifting when altered by a compensatory resistance mutation in response to current antiviral drug therapy. Together these different regimes allow the virus to maintain a constant -1-frameshifting efficiency to ensure successful virus propagation. Figure 1. -1FS on HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA. (A) Scheme of the gag-pol frameshifting site. Slippery site (SS1) and the putative second slippery site (pSS2) are highlighted in green; the stimulatory mRNA structure element downstream of the SS1 is indicated as a stem-loop (SL1). Amino acids incorporated into 0-frame and -1-frame peptides as well as the potential -1FS routes and in vivo efficiencies are shown below the frameshifting sites. (B) Top panel: Amino acids incorporated into 0-and -1-frames are shown above the mRNA sequence. Bottom panel: -1FS efficiency with the wild-type (wt) mRNA and U 4 C derivative with disrupted SS1 measured at limiting amounts of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu (molar ratio 0.3 tRNA to 70S ribosome) at the end of translation (2 min). The 0-frame is the sum of MQANF and MQANFLG peptides, -1-frame corresponds to MQANFFR/FLR peptides. MQANF was identified based on its position on the chromatogram while MQANFFR/FLR and MQANFLG products were quantified using [ 14 C]Arg and [ 3 H]Gly, respectively. (C) Concentration dependence of -1FS efficiency on the Leu-tRNA NAA Leu (tRNA NAA Leu , closed circles) or a mixture of tRNA Leu isoacceptors reading CUN codons (tRNA NAG Leu , open circles). -1FS product was detected using [ 14 C]Arg. (D) Change in the FS regime with the Leu-tRNA NAA Leu concentration. The ratio of FFR route (open circles) versus FLR (closed circles) route was calculated from peptides with different radioactive labels as follows. The sum of FFR and FLR frameshifting products was calculated using [ 14 C]Arg. To determine the amount of FLR, the mRNA was translated to the 0-frame peptide fMet-Gln-Asn-Phe-Leu-Gly-Lys-Ile (MQANFLGKI). The presence of Ile allows for separation between 0-frame MQANFLGKI and -1-frame MQANFLR peptides. The FFR peptide was then determined by subtracting the FLR from the total Arg-containing product. (E) -1FS efficiency in the presence of varying concentrations of Gly-tRNA Gly in the presence of excess Arg-tRNA Arg (2 M) (green squares) or with varying concentrations of Arg-tRNA Arg in the presence of 3 or 6 M Gly-tRNA Gly (red and light red squares, respectively).","Many viruses use programmed ribosome frameshifting to increase the coding capacity of their genome and to regulate stoichiometric ratio between viral proteins (1) (2) (3) (4) . The two HIV-1 genes, gag and pol, encode viral structural proteins and enzymes, respectively, and overlap by 205 nt. Synthesis of the Gag-Pol polyprotein requires -1 ribosome frameshifting (-1FS) (5) . The ratio between Gag and Gag-Pol is crucial for virus propagation and its dysregulation is detrimental for replication, virion formation and infectivity of HIV-1 (6) (7) (8) (9) . The efficiency of gag-pol -1FS in human cells is about 10%, ranging from 2% to 11% with different reporters (10) (11) (12) (13) . This -1FS efficiency has been recapitulated in vivo or in vitro in mammalian, yeast or Escherichia coli translation extracts (5, 11, (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) , suggesting that the virus exploits evolutionary conserved features of the translational apparatus."
TRIM21: a cytosolic Fc receptor with broad antibody isotype specificity,"This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.","Antibodies are a crucial part of the immune response toward invading pathogens such as viruses, and the induction of so-called neutralizing antibodies is a primary goal of vaccination (1) . In addition, there is great interest in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies specific for major human pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus (2, 3) . Neutralization of viruses by antibodies is predicted to depend on high-affinity binding to specific epitopes of surface-exposed viral proteins that are required for binding to target cell receptors (4) . Such antibodies are thought to function according to the occupancy model that requires binding of a critical number of antibodies to a viral particle in such a way that most or all neutralizing epitopes are occupied (5) . This may occur independently, or in concert with other antibody-mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (6, 7) . These effector functions are induced upon binding of antibody-virus immune complexes to classical Fc c receptors (FccRs) expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which results in clearance and induction of T-cell responses (8) . Neutralizing antibodies also prevent infection in concert with non-classical Fc receptors such as the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) (9, 10) . While FcRn mediates bidirectional transport of IgG across mucosal epithelial surfaces (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , pIgR mediates unidirectional transcytosis of IgA and IgM from the tissue into the luminal space (9) . Transcellular transport of neutralizing but also non-neutralizing antibody has been shown to facilitate protection against viral infection (9, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) ."
Clinical and sero-molecular characterization of Escherichia coli with an emphasis on hybrid strain in healthy and diarrheic neonatal calves in Egypt,"The present study was carried out to characterize pathogenic E. coli in apparently healthy and diarrheic neonatal calves with special reference to the hybrid E. coli strains and evaluate their clinical and hematobiochemical consequences. One hundred and seventy calves (age 1-30 days) were divided into two groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). Animals were subjected to thorough clinical, hematobiochemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinically, diarrheic calves showed various degree of diarrhea with the presence of cardinal signs of dehydration in moderate and severe cases. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the hemogram parameters with uremia and hyperkalemia in calves with severe diarrhea. The O-H serotyping of cultural and biochemically positive isolates identified 31 isolates belonging to 12 serotypes including and O128:H2. Molecular characterization of E. coli isolates on three toxin genes: heat-stable enterotoxin (sta), shiga toxin type 1 and 2 (stx1 and stx2) revealed two well-known with high frequency of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Molecular analysis also showed a number of E. coli isolates that carry sta and stx1 or sta and stx2 gene and belonged to O8, and O127:H6, O86 and O128:H2. These isolates were identified as hybrid E. coli strains (ETEC-STEC) and found in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. In conclusion, the present study identified high frequency of pathogenic E. coli in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. Serological and molecular analysis of E. coli isolates showed that high frequency of EHEC and presence of a new phenotype, STEC-ETEC hybrid, revealing their importance in the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea in calves and reinforcing the role of these animals as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic E. coli for humans.","Diarrhea in neonatal calves is the leading cause of calf's morbidity and mortality worldwide (Constable, 2004; Jor et al., 2010) . It is a major cause of economic loss (Uhde et al., 2008; Bartels et al., 2010; Cho and Yoon, 2014) due to inefficient feed conversion, reduced live body weight, delay marketing, costly preventive and therapeutic program, deaths, loss of genetic material for herd improvement and decrease in the number of neonates for herd replacement and expansion (Uhde et al., 2008; Bartels et al., 2010; Cho and Yoon, 2014) . Diarrhea is a complex syndrome as it involves interaction between environmental, nutritional factors and infectious agents (Naylor, 2002) . Several enteropathogens have been incriminated in calf diarrhea including E. coli, Salmonella, Clostridium, bovine coronavirus, bovine rotavirus group A, bovine viral diarrhea virus and cryptosporidium species (Kelling et al., 2002; Bhat et al., 2012; Singla et al., 2013; Cho, and Yoon, 2014) . Strain of Escherichia coli have long been recognized as a major enteropathogen in the first 28 days of calf's life."
"Emerging Microbes and Infections (2012) 1, e4","Vaccination continues to have a major impact on the health of humans and animals. Furthermore, vaccination of animals is proving to be effective in reducing transmission to humans. Understanding linkages between innate and adaptive immunity are improving formulations of new, as well as existing, vaccines, making them more effective.","Vaccination has saved more lives than many other therapeutic interventions combined. Prominent examples are smallpox and polio, where prior to immunization, millions of people died annually. Indeed, the World Health Organization estimates that vaccination has prevented paralysis in over eight million people since polio eradication programs began in 1988. These are just two examples of many diseases that have been effectively controlled by vaccination and thus have saved millions of lives. As a result, our children today are protected from diseases, such as measles, pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria to name a few. However, even with such overwhelming statistics, a strong anti-vaccine lobby exists to dissuade parents from vaccinating their children. This is both wrong and ill-informed placing individuals and communities at risk. These individuals benefit from being surrounded by vaccinated children by an effect commonly referred to as herd immunity. Unfortunately, this is being ignored by the strong lobby groups, who base their rhetoric on a few very selected falsehoods and ignore the benefits of immunization. The classical falsehood is that vaccines cause autism. This has been disproved many times but still gets brought up by the anti-vaccine lobby groups as well as the popular press. Thus, communicating the benefits of immunization to the broad public represents an important challenge for all of us."
Persistence in Temporary Lung Niches: A Survival Strategy of Lung-Resident Memory CD8 + T Cells,"Respiratory virus infections, such as those mediated by influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), rhinovirus, and adenovirus, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in children and older adults. Furthermore, the potential emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus poses a significant public health threat. Thus, the development of vaccines capable of eliciting long-lasting protective immunity to those pathogens is a major public health priority. CD8 + Tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells are a newly defined population that resides permanently in the nonlymphoid tissues including the lung. These cells are capable of providing local protection immediately after infection, thereby promoting rapid host recovery. Recent studies have offered new insights into the anatomical niches that harbor lung CD8 + T RM cells, and also identified the requirement and limitations of T RM maintenance. However, it remains controversial whether lung CD8 + T RM cells are continuously replenished by new cells from the circulation or permanently lodged in this site. A better understanding of how lung CD8 + T RM cells are generated and maintained and the tissue-specific factors that drive local T RM formation is required for optimal vaccine development. This review focuses on recent advance in our understanding of CD8 + T RM cell establishment and maintenance in the lung, and describes how those processes are uniquely regulated in this tissue.","M emory T cells have been divided into two distinct subsets based on their distinct migratory properties (107) . Central memory T (T CM ) cells express lymph nodehoming receptors L-selectin (CD62L) and CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), and preferentially circulate between lymph nodes and blood. Effector memory T (T EM ) cells lack the expressions of these receptors and circulate between the blood and nonlymphoid barrier tissues such as the skin, lung, intestines, and female reproductive tract. Upon secondary infection, T EM cells exhibit immediate effector functions at the site of infection, while T CM cells undergo extensive expansion in the draining lymph nodes before migrating to the site of infection and eliminating virus-infected cells (106) . It has recently emerged that memory T cells in the nonlymphoid tissues, which had previously been classified as a circulating T EM population, include a noncirculating cell population that resides permanently within the peripheral tissues. These cells have been termed tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells (34) and comprise the majority of memory T cells in the nonlymphoid tissues that confer immediate protection against peripheral infection (119) . Low levels of T EM cells also transit the peripheral tissues and contribute to local protection (83) . More recent studies have revealed that T RM cells are present in wide variety of lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, including brain, salivary glands, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, and dorsal root ganglia (96) . The generation and maintenance of T RM cells in each of these tissues differ significantly, indicating a major role for tissue-specific instruction (53) . Therefore, there is a need to identify the unique signals underlying each tissue microenvironment and the molecular mechanisms that instruct T RM formation."
FULL PAPER Surgery Ocular abnormalities associated with hypovitaminosis A in Hanwoo calves: a report of two cases,"This study reports on two Hanwoo (a native Korean breed of cattle) calves, a 3-and 6-month-old presenting with diarrhea, anorexia and blindness. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema in both calves. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for bovine viral diarrhea virus, rotavirus and coronavirus were all negative. The levels of serum vitamin A in the two affected calves were 0.317 µg/dl and 0.481 µg/dl, respectively. These values are much lower than the normal vitamin A levels; therefore, the calves were diagnosed with hypovitaminosis A.","Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient for reproduction, development, normal growth, and the functioning of the nervous system and vision, especially in growing animals [2, 5, 9] . Vitamin A deficiency can result in a series of pathologic changes and organ dysfunction [2, 5] . The clinical signs of hypovitaminosis A include poor weight gain, convulsions, diarrhea, exophthalmos, and blindness in calves and convulsions, ataxia, and blindness in adult cattle [3, 6, 7, 9] ."
The elusive quest for RNA knots,"Physical entanglement, and particularly knots arise spontaneously in equilibrated polymers that are sufficiently long and densely packed. Biopolymers are no exceptions: knots have long been known to occur in proteins as well as in encapsidated viral DNA. The rapidly growing number of RNA structures has recently made it possible to investigate the incidence of physical knots in this type of biomolecule, too. Strikingly, no knots have been found to date in the known RNA structures. In this Point of View Article we discuss the absence of knots in currently available RNAs and consider the reasons why knots in RNA have not yet been found, despite the expectation that they should exist in Nature. We conclude by singling out a number of RNA sequences that, based on the properties of their predicted secondary structures, are good candidates for knotted RNAs.","The systematic characterization and classification of knots has engaged scientists since the introduction of Tait's knots table, whose first entries are shown in Fig. 1A . It is readily seen that the different types of entanglement are permanently trapped in the closed curves. In fact, any two curves cannot be continuously deformed into one another unless they are cut open, rearranged and resealed."
"Origin, Evolution, and Genotyping of Emergent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strains in the United States","Coronaviruses are known to infect humans and other animals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here we report the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States and determination of its origin, evolution, and genotypes based on temporal and geographical evidence. Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of PEDV isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three U.S. strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese PEDV strains and their likely Chinese origin. The U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent U.S. strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV. Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the PED outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent U.S. PEDV strains share unique genetic features at the 5=-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission. The data from this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in the United States and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures against PEDV. IMPORTANCE The sudden emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus, for the first time in the United States causes significant economic and public health concerns. Since its recognition in May 2013, PEDV has rapidly spread across the United States, resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 States now. The ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula and the historical deadly nature of the 2002 outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus create further anxiety over the emergence of PEDV in the United States due to the lack of scientific information about the origin and evolution of this emerging coronavirus. Here we report the detailed genetic characterization, origin, and evolution of emergent PEDV strains in the United States. The results provide much needed information to devise effective preventive and control strategies against PEDV in the United States.

Outbreaks of PED have been documented in many European and Asian countries in the past (11) . PED has been documented in China since the 1980s; however, variant strains of PEDV associated with large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea with 80 to 100% morbidity and 50 to 90% mortality in suckling piglets have emerged in China since 2010 and pose a serious concern for the swine industry of China (12) (13) (14) ."
2018 recommendations for the management of community acquired pneumonia,Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death worldwide.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with a significant impact on morbidity rates. (1) Despite the vast diversity of respiratory microbiota, the widespread dissemination of potentially pathogenic agents, the phenomenon of globalization, and the occurrence of viral epidemics, Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most prevalent pathogen among the etiologic agents of CAP. (2) In Brazil, as well as in other countries, there has been a significant decrease in the mortality rates for respiratory tract infections, although the magnitude of this decrease has lessened in recent decades. Among pneumonias, CAP remains the one with the greatest impact and is the third leading cause of mortality in Brazil. Although the absolute number of deaths in Brazil has increased because of population growth and aging, when the mortality rate for CAP is standardized by age, a 25.5% decrease is observed between 1990 and 2015. (3) An improved socioeconomic situation, greater access to health care, national availability of antibiotics, and vaccination policies partially explain the decrease in mortality rates in Brazil. (4) Since the latest Guidelines on CAP from the Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia (SBPT, Brazilian Thoracic Association) were published, (5) several topics have been reviewed, such as advances in the application of imaging tests; advances in and impact of etiologic investigation, particularly investigation of viral etiology and atypical pathogens in subgroups of patients; risk stratification at admission; prognostic score stratification; the role of biomarkers in therapeutic management; recommendations for antibiotic therapy and its duration; and recommendations regarding influenza and pneumococcal vaccination."

Electronic) A periodical of the Network for the Veterinarians of,"Despite the significant progress in the recent efforts toward developing an effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis, the search for new protective vaccination strategy still remains a challenge and elusive goal because it becomes the appropriate way to prevent the disease. Various experimental approaches in the past few years showed that developing a potential vaccine against the disease can be achievable. The combination of multi-epitopes expressing different stages of the parasite life cycle has become an optimal strategy for acquiring a potent, safe, and effective vaccine. Epitope-based vaccines have gained attention as alternative vaccine candidates due to their ability of inducing protective immune responses. This mini-review highlights the current status and the prospects of Toxoplasma gondii vaccine development along with the application of epitope-based vaccine in the future parasite immunization as a novel under development and evaluation strategy.","Toxoplasmosis is a prevalent disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), which is a zoonotic parasite that infects humans, domestic, and wild mammals [1, 2] . It is a significant, life-threatening disease with medical, veterinary, and economic importance worldwide [3, 4] . Immunocompetent individuals infected with toxoplasmosis are usually asymptomatic or might have mild symptoms, while, this disease in immunocompromised patients can be quite severe or even fatal [5, 6] . Despite several available antiparasitic chemical drugs used to prevent or cure the infection and to limit and control the spread of T. gondii parasite in an infected host, these drugs still have limited efficacy and are not absolutely safe and could cause severe side effects [7] [8] [9] . Thus, acquiring safe and effective vaccine to control the vital impact of toxoplasmosis in both humans and animals is urgently needed [10] ."
Human Coronavirus EMC Does Not Require the SARS-Coronavirus Receptor and Maintains Broad Replicative Capability in Mammalian Cell Lines,"A new human coronavirus (hCoV-EMC) has emerged very recently in the Middle East. The clinical presentation resembled that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as encountered during the epidemic in 2002/2003. In both cases, acute renal failure was observed in humans. HCoV-EMC is a member of the same virus genus as SARS-CoV but constitutes a sister species. Here we investigated whether it might utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV receptor.","ruses. Over the last decades, several animal CoVs have been identified, including major pathogens such as the bovine CoV and the avian infectious bronchitis virus. Two human CoVs (hCoVs) termed hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E have been known since the 1960s, causing mild respiratory disease (1) . In 2002/2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) leading to over 700 deaths was caused by a novel hCoV termed SARS-CoV (2, 3) . In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, two additional hCoVs termed hCoV-NL63 and -HKU1 as well as numerous novel bat-associated CoVs were described (4) (5) (6) (7) . CoVs have been reclassified into four genera designated Alphacoronavirus (former groups 1a and 1b), Betacoronavirus (groups 2a to 2d), Gammacoronavirus (group 3), and as recently suggested, Deltacoronavirus (8) . A likely animal reservoir for SARS-CoV has been identified in bats (7, (9) (10) (11) . Nevertheless, bat-derived CoVs have never been isolated in cell culture. Prototypic CoVs, including the SARS-CoV, are almost unculturable in bat-derived cell lines (11, 12) . Double infections of bats with different CoVs are very rare (13) , and bat CoVs appear to be restricted to their bat hosts at the genus level (14, 15) ."
Prevalence and Clinicopathological Features of Triaditis in a Prospective Case Series of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Cats,"Background: The term triaditis designates the concurrent presence of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cholangitis, and pancreatitis in cats.","T he term triaditis has been coined to describe concurrent inflammatory infiltration of the intestines (IBD), the biliary system, and the pancreas in cats. 1, 2 However, the terminology for this condition remains controversial. The controversy over the characterization of triaditis as a separate syndrome is not surprising, considering that the 3 component diseases remain poorly characterized with regard to their pathogenesis and their clinical, laboratory, and histopathological 4 total thyroxine fT 4 free thyroxine concentrations 95% CI 95% Confidence Interval manifestations. 2 In addition, the inconsistent clinical and laboratory findings and lack of specific and sensitive laboratory tests often make their ante-mortem diagnosis challenging. Histopathologic evaluation of hepatic, pancreatic, and intestinal biopsy specimens is essential for a definitive diagnosis. However, no consensus exists regarding the histopathological nomenclature and classification of the lesions of the component diseases of triaditis. Also, interpretation of borderline lesions of these component diseases might be challenging. These factors have made it difficult to compare results of different studies and definitively define clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic standards. To address this problem, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) has formed the Liver Standardization Group, 3 and later, the Gastrointestinal Standardization Group, 4 which have summarized histopathological standards for the diagnosis of hepatic and gastrointestinal inflammation in biopsy samples from dogs and cats. [3] [4] [5] However, since the publication of these standards in 2006 and 2010, 5, 6 there have been concerns about the validity and reproducibility of these standards in clinical cases. 7 To date, there is little literature focused on feline triaditis and clinical studies are lacking. Several case reports describe cats with different combinations of inflammatory conditions of the intestine, liver, and pancreas, in some patients also in combination with hepatic lipidosis, chronic nephritis, or some combination of these disorders. 2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, these reports are either incomplete in terms of laboratory analysis [22] [23] [24] or include only a small number of cases. 21, 25, 26 Current knowledge mostly is derived from retrospective postmortem studies. 1, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In 2 independent studies, the coexistence of feline cholangiohepatitis or cholangitis with pancreatitis and IBD was reported in 39% 29 or 32% 31 of cats examined."

Fc receptors and their influence on efficacy of therapeutic antibodies for treatment of viral diseases,"The lack of vaccines against several important viral diseases necessitates the development of therapeutics to save lives and control epidemics. In recent years, therapeutic antibodies have received considerable attention due to their good safety profiles and clinical success when used against viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus and Hendra virus. The binding affinity of these antibodies can directly impact their therapeutic efficacy. However, we and others have also demonstrated that the subtype of Fc-gamma receptors (FcgRs) engaged influences the stoichiometric requirement for virus neutralization. Hence, the development of therapeutic antibodies against infectious diseases should consider the FcgRs engaged and Fc-effector functions involved. This review highlights the current state of knowledge about FcgRs and FcgR effector functions involved in virus neutralization, with emphasis on factors that can affect FcgR engagement. A better understanding of Fc-FcgR interactions during virus neutralization will allow development of therapeutic antibodies that are efficacious and can be administered with minimal side effects.","The lack of vaccines against several important viral diseases necessitates the development of therapeutics to save lives and control epidemics.

While vaccination now protects against several important infectious diseases, many others still lack effective vaccines. The ability of viruses to rapidly mutate and alter their antigenic makeup (e.g., influenza and HIV), as well as the potential interference between different virus serotypes (e.g., dengue virus) has made vaccine development a challenging task. Given that infection with such viruses can result in a significant number of cases and high mortality rates, rapid development of potent therapeutic measures can potentially save lives and limit the magnitude of outbreaks. With technological advances in the field of immunoglobulin G (IgG) research and generally good safety profiles observed during antibody-based therapies, therapeutic antibodies have become attractive candidates for treating infectious diseases. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a good example of the potential of mAb cocktails as an anti-infective strategy [1] . Other examples include the use of mAb m102.4 against Hendra virus [2] and palivizumab that targets respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [3] , resulting in significant reduction in the incidence of hospitalization. Given the need for new antiviral therapies and considerable advances in IgG research, there is a growing interest in developing therapeutic antibodies against infectious diseases."
Contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment by healthcare providers,"Objective In this study, we aimed to describe the processes of both the donning and the doffing of personal protective equipment for Ebola and evaluate contamination during the doffing process.","Ebola was first identified 40 years ago. 1, 2 However, little interest has given to this highly contagious pathogen until an outbreak was confirmed by the World Health Organization in 2014 in Congo. 3, 4 Disease spreads across nine countries and its death was toll of over 11,000 person in three West African nations, and people around the world began to concern about the Ebola nowadays. Ebola spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) or indirect contact with infected materials, such as clothing. [5] [6] [7] As other infectious diseases, healthcare workers are at risk of infection because they have to work at the frontline, often without protections. 8, 9 Cases of contamination while treating Ebola patients rose rapidly during the current outbreak, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the new personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines for healthcare providers treating Ebola patients. [10] [11] [12] However, even with protective clothing, a healthcare worker can be contaminated if removal is not done in a manner that prevents exposure. [13] [14] [15] A limited numbers of studies have been performed regarding contamination with PPE usage. In this study, our primary aim was to evaluate contamination during doffing. The secondary purpose was to describe errors and delays during donning and doffing."
Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern; a Review Article,"Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) was first reported in 1976 with two concurrent outbreaks of acute viral hemorrhagic fever centered in Yambuku (near the Ebola river), Democratic Republic of Congo, and in Nzara, Sudan.

Roles of N-Myc and STAT Interactor in Cancer: From Initiation to Dissemination,"N-myc & STAT Interactor, NMI, is a protein that has mostly been studied for its physical interactions with transcription factors that play critical roles in tumor growth, progression and metastasis. NMI is an inducible protein, thus its intracellular levels and location can vary dramatically, influencing a diverse array of cellular functions in a context-dependent manner. The physical interactions of NMI with its binding partners have been linked to many aspects of tumor biology including DNA damage response, cell death, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness. Thus, discovering more details about the function(s) of NMI could reveal key insights into how transcription factors like c-Myc, STATs and BRCA1 are contextually regulated. Although a normal, physiological function of NMI has not yet been discovered, it has potential roles in pathologies ranging from viral infection to cancer. This review provides a timely perspective of the unfolding roles of NMI with specific focus on cancer progression and metastasis.","Multiple studies have been focused on elucidating the roles of transcription factors, but less attention has been given to proteins that indirectly influence specific transcriptional events. These proteins are of critical importance because of their organ-specific, spatio-temporal regulatory ability. Understanding these indirect influences may hold the key to revealing intricate, biologically relevant details of signaling pathway regulation."

Inhibition of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 1 Ameliorates Inflammation and Macrophage and Neutrophil Activation in Alcoholic Liver Disease in Mice,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by macrophage and neutrophil leukocyte recruitment and activation in the liver. Damage-and pathogen-associated molecular patterns contribute to a self-perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM-1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mimicking complexes GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5-week alcohol feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol-fed mice, and TREM-1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM-1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol-induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM-1 signaling. The TREM-1","endoplasmic reticulum stress and trigger release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In addition, excessive and/or chronic alcohol consumption disrupts the gut barrier function and changes the gut microbiome, leading to increased levels of microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the circulation. PAMPs from portal circulation and locally released DAMPs provide proinflammatory signals in the liver for activation of resident Kupffer cells and recruitment of activated macrophages and neutrophil leukocytes from the bone marrow. (1, 2) Increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in animal models of ALD and in patients with alcoholic hepatitis contribute to macrophage and neutrophil activation and proinflammatory cascade activation by theTLR4 receptor complex. Cytokines induced by PAMPs and DAMPs contribute to a self-perpetuating proinflammatory state that characterizes alcoholic hepatitis. (3) TREM-1 is an activating receptor complex that is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and amplifies TLR signaling. (4) It has been shown that TREM-1 can amplify TLR4-mediated as well as TLR2-mediated proinflammatory signals. (5, 6) The expression and function of TREM-1 has been indicated in various inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, cancer, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), atherosclerosis, and experimental colitis. (7) (8) (9) Expression of TREM-1 in hepatic stellate cells was proposed as a prognostic factor in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and TREM-1-mediated Kupffer cell activation was found in HCC. (10, 11) Little is known about the role of TREM-1 in ALD. Here, we hypothesized that inhibition of TREM-1 will ameliorate inflammation and liver damage in ALD, given the known role of TREM-1 in myeloid cell activation and amplification of proinflammatory signaling."
Characterization of the Fecal Bacterial Microbiota of Healthy and Diarrheic Dairy Calves,Background: Neonatal diarrhea accounts for more than 50% of total deaths in dairy calves. Few population-based studies of cattle have investigated how the microbiota is impacted during diarrhea.,"N eonatal calf diarrhea accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality in calves, accounting for >50% of total deaths, and has a large impact on the economy of dairy farms. 1 Although pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp), viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus), and protozoa (Cryptosporidium spp) can be found in a large percentage of cases, the etiology of disease may be hard to discern because of the common presence of coinfections (>1 pathogen identified in the same patient) 2 and the fact that most organism also can be found in healthy individuals. These observations suggest that the cause of diarrhea is complex rather than associated with a single pathogen. Diagnosis of enteric disease also is likely affected by the complexity of the microbiota (ie, the rich and diverse polymicrobial community present in the gut)."
Public preferences for interventions to prevent emerging infectious disease threats: a discrete choice experiment,"Objective When faced with an emergent epidemic with high mortality and morbidity potential, policy makers must decide what public health interventions to deploy at different stages of the outbreak. However, almost nothing is known about how the public view these interventions or how they trade off risks (of disease) with inconvenience (of interventions). In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes. Design A discrete choice experiment. setting This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013. Participants A random sample of 500 Singapore residents aged 21 and over, including 271 women and 229 men, was analysed. Outcome measures Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes and declared a preference for one combination. A random utility model was developed to determine the individual's preference for interventions and a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct respondent preference classes.","Objective When faced with an emergent epidemic with high mortality and morbidity potential, policy makers must decide what public health interventions to deploy at different stages of the outbreak.

The number of infections did not significantly influence respondents' responses. We identified two broad classes of respondents: those who were mortality averse and those who were expenditure averse. Education was found to be a predictor of group membership. Conclusion Overall, there was considerable support for government interventions to prevent or mitigate outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including those that greatly restricted individual liberties, as long as the restrictions showed a reasonable chance of reducing the adverse health effects of the outbreak."
Original StudieS,"Context: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Objective: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. Results: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. Limitations: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. Conclusions: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.","Underground and aggregated at a weekly scale.

Elevated level of renal xanthine oxidase mRNA transcription after nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus infection in growing layers,"To assess relationships between xanthine oxidase (XOD) and nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) infection, 240 growing layers (35 days old) were randomly divided into two groups (infected and control) of 120 chickens each. Each chicken in the control and infected group was intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL sterile physiological saline and virus, respectively, after which serum antioxidant parameters and renal XOD mRNA expression in growing layers were evaluated at 8, 15 and 22 days post-inoculation (dpi). The results showed that serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in the infected group were significantly lower than in the control group at 8 and 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01), while serum malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly higher (p ＜ 0.01). The serum uric acid was significantly higher than that of the control group at 15 dpi (p ＜ 0.01). In addition, the kidney mRNA transcript level and serum activity of XOD in the infected group was significantly higher than that of the control group at 8, 15 and 22 dpi (p ＜ 0.05). The results indicated that NIBV infection could cause the increases of renal XOD gene transcription and serum XOD activity, leading to hyperuricemia and reduction of antioxidants in the body.","Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can cause serious and highly contagious viral disease in chickens and has many serotypes or variants [34] . Nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) is one of the most prevalent viruses, exhibiting strong renal tropism and the potential to cause significant mortality to the poultry industry [12, 35] . Chickens of all ages may be infected, and infected chickens are characterized by coughing, depression, nasal discharge, sneezing, polyuria, and death [4, 25] . Clinicopathological studies reported that infection with NIBV can cause the kidneys of chickens to become swollen and pale, with deposition of monosodium urate crystals in tubules and ureters, resulting in visceral gout [14, 30] . Exacerbation of visceral gout may be associated with adverse metabolic, nutritional, or infectious conditions, and toxicity. Infections have become the most important cause of gout, and nephropathogenic strain of infectious bronchitis virus has become one of the most prevalent pathogens associated with the outbreak of visceral gout [11] ."
One Health stakeholder and institutional analysis in Kenya,"Introduction: One Health (OH) can be considered a complex emerging policy to resolve health issues at the animalÁhuman and environmental interface. It is expected to drive system changes in terms of new formal and informal institutional and organisational arrangements. This study, using Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a zoonotic problem requiring an OH approach, sought to understand the institutionalisation process at national and subnational levels in an early adopting country, Kenya. Materials and methods: Social network analysis methodologies were used. Stakeholder roles and relational data were collected at national and subnational levels in 2012. Key informants from stakeholder organisations were interviewed, guided by a checklist. Public sector animal and public health organisations were interviewed first to identify other stakeholders with whom they had financial, information sharing and joint cooperation relationships. Visualisation of the OH social network and relationships were shown in sociograms and mathematical (degree and centrality) characteristics of the network summarised. Results and discussion: Thirty-two and 20 stakeholders relevant to OH were identified at national and subnational levels, respectively. Their roles spanned wildlife, livestock, and public health sectors as well as weather prediction. About 50% of national-level stakeholders had made significant progress on OH institutionalisation to an extent that formal coordination structures (zoonoses disease unit and a technical working group) had been created. However, the process had not trickled down to subnational levels although cross-sectoral and sectoral collaborations were identified. The overall binary social network density for the stakeholders showed that 35 and 21% of the possible ties between the RVF and OH stakeholders existed at national and subnational levels, respectively, while public health actors' collaborations were identified at community/grassroots level. We recommend extending the OH network to include the other 50% stakeholders and fostering of the process at subnational-level building on available cross-sectoral platforms.","*Correspondence to: Tabitha Kimani, PO Box 1510-00200 Nairobi, Kenya, Email: mugethikimani@yahoo.com I nfectious diseases are likely to continue emerging and re-emerging in the foreseeable future, with profound negative impacts on multiple sectors and global economies (1) . Zoonoses account for 70% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and 60% of human pathogens/ diseases (2Á4). About 80% of human infectious disease pathogens could be used for bioterrorism (5) . Major zoonotic EIDs that have occurred over the last 20 years include bovine spongiform encephalopathy, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), severe acute respiratory syndrome (6) , Hendra virus disease (7), Nipah virus encephalitis (8) , West Nile fever (9) , pandemic H1N1 influenza (10) , Middle East respiratory syndrome (11) and Ebola (12) . Apart from the EIDs, endemic zoonoses such as Rift Valley fever (RVF) are also of great concern."
Daylight-driven rechargeable antibacterial and antiviral nanofibrous membranes for bioprotective applications,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health. Most present personal protective equipment used to prevent EID transmission and infections is typically devoid of antimicrobial activity. We report on green bioprotective nanofibrous membranes (RNMs) with rechargeable antibacterial and antiviral activities that can effectively produce biocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) solely driven by the daylight. The premise of the design is that the photoactive RNMs can store the biocidal activity under light irradiation and readily release ROS under dim light or dark conditions, making the biocidal function ""always online."" The resulting RNMs exhibit integrated properties of fast ROS production, ease of activity storing, long-term durability, robust breathability, interception of fine particles (>99%), and high bactericidal (>99.9999%) and virucidal (>99.999%) efficacy, which enabled to serve as a scalable biocidal layer for protective equipment by providing contact killing against pathogens either in aerosol or in liquid forms. The successful synthesis of these fascinating materials may provide new insights into the development of protection materials in a sustainable, self-recharging, and structurally adaptive form.","Public health outbreaks driven by emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) constitute the forefront of global safety concerns (1, 2) . EID outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and Ebola virus disease (EVD), have shaped the course of human history and caused incalculable misery and death (3, 4) . This issue was highlighted by the 2014 EVD epidemic crisis in West Africa, a total of 28,646 confirmed cases with 11,323 deaths, which was an explicit example of unpreparedness of the public health system (4) . In particular, the risk of acquisition of an EID during the care of a patient is significantly high for health care workers (HCWs) (5) . Although the HCWs did their best to control the recent EVD outbreaks, 852 HCWs were diagnosed with Ebola, and 492 of them died (6, 7) . The infection incidence among HCWs became 100 times higher than that of the general population (7) . To prevent the transmission of EID spread in a workplace, HCWs are advised to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, bioprotective suits, and medical gloves, according to the standard infection prevention and control guidance (8, 9) . Although these PPE can significantly minimize the pathogen transmission, the risk of infection cannot be entirely eliminated (9) . EID pathogens can be effectively captured and intercepted by the relevant protective materials; however, the sustained infection activity of the pathogen could easily cause crosscontamination and postinfection, which might lead to increased risk of pathogen spreading (10, 11) . Alternatively, antimicrobial active protective technologies by incorporating biocidal agents into PPE materials could be another strategy to provide promising bioprotection against EID pathogens because direct contact killing is achieved (12, 13) . Various biocides, such as triclosan, nisaplin, essential oils, peptide, chitosan, and silver nanoparticles, have recently been incorporated for bioprotective applications (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . However, their immediate biocidal effect usually suffers from significant decline due to the irreversible consumption of the biocides (19) . More effective, easy-to-use, field-deployable, and durable PPE materials to provide antimicrobial bioprotection from infection source to point-of-use are needed, particularly for the outdoor emergency medical services."
HRCT imaging features in representative imported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,"With the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been one of the key diagnostic tools. To achieve early and accurate diagnostics, determining the radiological characteristics of the disease is of great importance. In this small scale research we retrospectively reviewed and selected six cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection in West China Hospital and investigated their initial and follow-up HRCT features, along with the clinical characteristics. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia basically showed a multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO), sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was identified in our presented cases. The follow-up CT generally demonstrated mild to moderate progression of the lesion, with only one case showing remission by the reducing extent and density of the airspace opacification.","The newly discovered novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was firstly identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and then spread rapidly across the whole country and the world. The first study estimated the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2019-nCoV to be 2.2, 1 much higher than the ideal control goal to be less than 1. By the day when this article was drafted (February 5 th , 2020), a total of 24,363 patients had been confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection in China and 282 in Sichuan Province, with 491 deaths reported in China and 1 in Chengdu of Sichuan Province, where West China Hospital of Sichuan University is located."
Infection and Drug Resistance Dovepress structural basis of development of multi-epitope vaccine against Middle east respiratory syndrome using in silico approach,"and South Korea (2015). No specific vaccine has yet been reported against MERS. Purpose: To address the urgent need for an MERS vaccine, in the present study, we have designed two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) against MERS utilizing several in silico methods and tools. Methods: The design of both the multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) are composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, screened form thirteen different proteins of MERS-CoV. Both the MEVs also carry potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon-γ-inducing epitopes. Human β-defensin-2 and β-defensin-3 were used as adjuvants to enhance the immune response of MEVs. To design the MEVs, short peptide molecular linkers were utilized to link screened most potential CTL epitopes, HTL epitopes and the adjuvants. Tertiary models for both the MEVs were generated, refined, and further studied for their molecular interaction with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNAs of both MEVs were generated and analyzed in silico for their expression in a mammalian host cell line (human). Results: Screened CTL and HTL epitopes were found to have high propensity for stable molecular interaction with HLA alleles molecules. CTL epitopes were also found to have favorable molecular interaction within the cavity of transporter associated with antigen processing. The selected CTL and HTL epitopes jointly cover upto 94.0% of worldwide human population. Both the CTL and HTL MEVs molecular models have shown to have stable binding and complex formation propensity with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNA analysis of both the MEVs have shown high expression tendency in mammalian host cell line (human). Conclusion: After multistage in silico analysis, both the MEVs are predicted to elicit humoral as well as cell mediated immune response. Epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover large human population worldwide. Hence both the designed MEVs could be tried in vivo as potential vaccine candidates against MERS. submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 2378 srivastava et al","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS involves high fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, chills, chest pain, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, running nose, renal failure, and pneumonia. The first case of MERS in humans was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. After 2012, within a span of only 4 years, MERS-CoV infection was reported from 27 countries. 1 Three MERS outbreaks have already occurred in Saudi Arabia (2013 and 2014) and South Korea (2015). [2] [3] [4] The outbreak reported in South Korea also involved spread of MERS through hospital-to-hospital transit of patients and had the fatality rate as high as 40%. High attack rate and easy spread of MERS indicate an epidemic risk. [5] [6] [7] To date, no specific vaccine is available for MERS. The steep increase in MERS cases and its high mortality rate demand an urgent need for specific and safe MERS vaccine. Thus far, only little information is known about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. Hence, an immunoinformatics approach to thoroughly study and screen immunogenic proteins from the available proteome sequence data of MERS-CoV is essential for vaccine design."
"INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and Financing","China's rapid and sustained economic growth offers an opportunity to ask whether the advantages of growth diffuse throughout an economy, or remain localized in areas where the growth has been the greatest. A critical policy area in China has been the health system, and health inequality has become an issue that has led the government to broaden national health insurance programs. This study investigates whether health system resources and performance have converged over the past 30 years across China's 31 provinces. To examine geographic variation of health system resources and performance at the provincial level, we measure the degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence in indicators of health system resources (structure), health services utilization (process), and outcome. All data are from officially published sources: the China Health Statistics Year Book and the China Statistics Year Book. Sigma convergence is found for resource indicators, whereas it is not observed for either process or outcome indicators, indicating that disparities only narrowed in health system resources. Beta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators, reflecting that provinces with poorer resources were catching up. Convergence found in this study probably reflects the mixed outcome of government input, and market forces. Thus, left alone, the equitable distribution of health care resources may not occur naturally during a period of economic growth. Governmental and societal efforts are needed to reduce geographic health variation and promote health equity.","In the last 30 years, China experienced high economic growth accompanied by a transition to a more marketoriented economy. The health system of China is also converting from a centrally planned health system to one that is more market oriented. 1 These transitions have resulted in an expanded supply of high-quality hospital services, especially to the people in large cities. Unfortunately, the majority of people in rural and poor areas are still having difficulties accessing good-quality and affordable health care. 2 Health inequality has become a major issue in the health system of China, which raises concerns among the general public and the government. 3 In China, health inequality at the individual level is reflected in health disparities between rural and urban areas and variation among provinces. The health disparity between urban and rural areas has been decreasing, but still exists. 4 Geographic health variation is also dramatic, but less studied. In 2005, Shanghai, the most affluent city in China, enjoyed 78 years' life expectancy at birth, which was the highest in China. However, the life expectancy at birth in the poorest province in Western China was only 65 years. 5 The extent of diffusion of the advantages of growth throughout the economy has not been rigorously studied. Our hypothesis is that over the 30 years' economic growth, geographic variation in health system resources and performance at the provincial level has decreased and is achieving convergence. The alternative hypothesis is that over the 30 years' economic growth, health resources and performance at the provincial level have increased, resulting in divergence."
"Hybridization properties of long nucleic acid probes for detection of variable target sequences, and development of a hybridization prediction algorithm","One of the main problems in nucleic acid-based techniques for detection of infectious agents, such as influenza viruses, is that of nucleic acid sequence variation. DNA probes, 70-nt long, some including the nucleotide analog deoxyribose-Inosine (dInosine), were analyzed for hybridization tolerance to different amounts and distributions of mismatching bases, e.g. synonymous mutations, in target DNA. Microsphere-linked 70-mer probes were hybridized in 3M TMAC buffer to biotinylated single-stranded (ss) DNA for subsequent analysis in a Luminex Õ system. When mismatches interrupted contiguous matching stretches of 6 nt or longer, it had a strong impact on hybridization. Contiguous matching stretches are more important than the same number of matching nucleotides separated by mismatches into several regions. dInosine, but not 5-nitroindole, substitutions at mismatching positions stabilized hybridization remarkably well, comparable to N (4-fold) wobbles in the same positions. In contrast to shorter probes, 70-nt probes with judiciously placed dInosine substitutions and/or wobble positions were remarkably mismatch tolerant, with preserved specificity. An algorithm, NucZip, was constructed to model the nucleation and zipping phases of hybridization, integrating both local and distant binding contributions. It predicted hybridization more exactly than previous algorithms, and has the potential to guide the design of variation-tolerant yet specific probes.","Microbial genomes can be highly variable because of high mutation rates. Because of this extreme variability, it is often difficult to identify regions within a specific virus genome that are sufficiently evolutionarily conserved to serve as targets for specific detection primers and probes. RNA viruses are especially variable. The influenza virus, a negative sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus with a highly variable RNA genome, for example, has been known to cause the diagnostic problem that is at the basis of this article, because of a high rate of mutation and genetic drift. In such situations, optimal detection primers and probes would be broadly targeted yet specific, and remain functional even if the genome sequence changed because of genetic drift."

Open Forum Infectious Diseases ® Quantification of Torque Teno Virus and Epstein-Barr Virus Is of Limited Value for Predicting the Net State of Immunosuppression After Lung Transplantation,"Major hurdles for survival after lung transplantation are rejections and infectious complications. Adequate methods for monitoring immune suppression status are lacking. Here, we evaluated quantification of torque teno virus (TTV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as biomarkers for defining the net state of immunosuppression in lung-transplanted patients.","For patients with end-stage lung disease, limited life expectancy, and otherwise acceptable physical condition, lung transplantation may be a life-saving therapeutic option. The 5-year survival rate is only approximately 50% in most centers, and 2 major limiting factors for the outcome of lung transplantation are the frequent occurrence of infectious complications and rejection of the transplanted organ [1] . Standard immunosuppression, to prevent graft rejection, consists of a combination of 3 immunosuppressive drugs that subvert B and T cells [2] [3] [4] . Currently, there is a lack of an easy-to-use marker that accurately predicts the net effect of the combined immunosuppression. Such a biomarker would be an important tool in the management of patients with compromised immune function to identify overor underimmunosuppression and evaluate the risk of infectious complications and acute rejections."
Original Contribution Distribution and Risk Factors of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Mainland China,"Data from all reported cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of cases were characterized through spatial analysis. The impact of travel-related risk factors on invasion of the disease was analyzed using survival analysis, and climatic factors related to local transmission were identified using multilevel Poisson regression, both at the county level. The results showed that the epidemic spanned a large geographic area, with the most affected areas being in western China. Significant differences in incidence were found among age groups, with incidences peaking in school-age children. Overall, the epidemic spread from southeast to northwest. Proximity to airports and being intersected by national highways or freeways but not railways were variables associated with the presence of the disease in a county. Lower temperature and lower relative humidity were the climatic factors facilitating local transmission after correction for the effects of school summer vacation and public holidays, as well as population density and the density of medical facilities. These findings indicate that interventions focused on domestic travel, population density, and climatic factors could play a role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.","In early April 2009, human cases of infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus were first identified in the United States and Mexico (1) . The virus then spread rapidly to other regions of the world. As of January 24, 2010, laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic influenza (H1N1-2009) were being reported in more than 209 countries or regions worldwide, with 14,711 deaths among confirmed cases (2) . Pandemic influenza was introduced to mainland China on May 9, 2009 (3, 4) , and then spread across the whole country. By the end of 2009, more than 120,000 confirmed cases were reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), including 648 deaths (5) . Information on reported cases was released daily by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China in the early stages of the pandemic and then twice weekly later on."
Rapid Communication,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteric coronavirus that causes diarrhea in piglets. However, the biological characteristics of PDCoV are unclear. In this study, the hemagglutination (HA) abilities of two PDCoV strains (CH-01 and HNZK-04) were investigated. Our results showed that PDCoV has the ability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes after virion pretreatment with trypsin or neuraminidase. Additionally, the HA assay results showed a significant positive correlation with the infectious viral titer. Our results suggest that assessing the HA activity of PDCoV may be a useful diagnostic method for investigating and surveilling PDCoV infections.","Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of the Deltacoronavirus genus, causes diarrhea and vomiting in pigs of any age [1] . The clinical symptoms of PDCoV are similar to those of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), but the mortality rates are lower in PDCoV-affected nursing pigs [2] . PDCoV was first identified in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012, while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in the United States in 2014 [3] . Subsequently, PDCoV was detected in Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, indicating that it is widespread among the world's pig populations; moreover, PDCoV can have devastating effects on the swine industry [4] .

Pre-Travel Medical Preparation of Business and Occupational Travelers,"were analyzed. Results: Of 23,534 travelers, 61% were non-occupational and 39% occupational. Business travelers were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business travelers indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. Conclusions: Sub-groups of occupational travelers have characteristic profiles, with business travelers being particularly distinct. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pretravel consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can identify vaccination gaps and increase coverage.","I n 2014, 1.1 billion travelers crossed international borders. 1 A 2012 report outlined that 18% of US residents visiting overseas destinations traveled for business purposes, and each traveler had a median of three international trips in the past 12 months and a median stay of 8 nights per trip. 2 Business travelers may face different health risks than leisure travelers, including occupational exposures and increased levels of stress due to their work schedules. 3, 4 In addition, business travelers are increasingly visiting developing countries. 4, 5 Research suggests that the risk of illness increases with greater differences in climate and culture between the country of origin and the destination country. 6 Further, occupational travel may contribute to the importation of disease to the traveler's home workplace and larger community; such importations often require costly workplace and public health responses. Many infections associated with occupational travel can be prevented by simple preventative measures, such as vaccines, medications, and health advice."
A Literature Review and Survey of Childhood Pneumonia Etiology Studies: 2000-2010,"The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) project is the largest multicountry etiology study of childhood pneumonia since the Board on Science and Technology in International Development studies of the 1980s. However, it is not the only recent or ongoing pneumonia etiology study, and even with seven sites, it cannot capture all epidemiologic settings in the developing world. Funding providers, researchers and policymakers rely on the best available evidence to strategically plan programs, new research directions and interventions. We aimed to describe the current landscape of recent pneumonia etiology studies in children under 5 years of age in the developed and developing world, as ascertained by a literature review of relevant studies with data since the year 2000 and a survey of researchers in the field of childhood pneumonia. We collected information on the study population, study design, case definitions, laboratory samples and methods and identified pathogens. A literature review identified 88 studies with child pneumonia etiology results. As of June 2010, our survey of researchers identified an additional 65 ongoing and recently completed child pneumonia etiology studies. This demonstrates the broad existing context into which the PERCH study must be placed. However, the landscape analysis also reveals a multiplicity of case definitions, levels of clinician involvement, facility types, specimen collection, and laboratory techniques. It reinforces the need for the standardization of methods and analyses for present and future pneumonia etiology studies in order to optimize their cumulative potential to accurately describe the microbial causes of childhood pneumonia.","The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) project is the largest multicountry etiology study of childhood pneumonia since the Board on Science and Technology in International Development studies of the 1980s.

Development of a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system for the simultaneous detection of influenza A and H5 subtype in avian influenza A-infected patients,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 is of critical importance for the effective clinical management of patients. Here, we developed a rapid and simultaneous detection toolkit for influenza A H5 subtype viruses in human samples based on a bioconjugate of quantum dots (QDs) assembly and a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system (SRDFDS). Methods: Two types of QDs were assembled on a latex bead to enhance the detection sensitivity and specificity of influenza A infection (QD580) and H5 subtype (QD650). The dual signals of influenza A and H5 subtype of H5N1-infected patients were detected simultaneously and quantified separately by SRDFDS equipped with two emission filters. Results: Our results showed a high sensitivity of 92.86% (13/14) and 78.57% (11/14), and a specificity of 100% (38/38, P < 0.0001) and 97.37% (37/38) for influenza A and H5 subtype detection, respectively. Conclusion: Therefore, our multiplex QD bioconjugates and SRDFDS-based influenza virus detection toolkit potentially provide accurate and meaningful diagnosis information with improved detection accuracies and sensitivities for H5N1 patients.","Avian influenza (AI) viruses are distinct from human seasonal influenza viruses and are not easily transmissible to humans [1] . However, AI viruses may occasionally infect humans through direct or indirect contact, resulting in disease symptoms ranging from a mild illness to death. AI has become a global concern with a mortality rate of approximately 60% [2] . In this context, the H5N1 virus is highly Ivyspring International Publisher contagious among birds and can be deadly, especially in domestic poultry and humans. Therefore, an on-site surveillance/alert system for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 would prevent widespread exposure to the virus and identify potential patients/animals for immediate attention and treatment. Improved case management of diseases with common flu symptoms is especially crucial in densely populated areas [3] . An adequate H5 subtype-specific diagnostic toolkit for on-site monitoring has not been developed, and current field-level point-of-care testing (POCT) is not recommended for screening AI infections in clinical samples due to insufficient sensitivity and poor accuracy [4] . Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers using antigen-specific antibodies can increase the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of POCT. Thus, many researchers have attempted to design a molecular diagnostic method for the simultaneous detection of influenza A and B as well as their subtypes [5] [6] [7] ."

Fractional Dosing of Yellow Fever Vaccine to Extend Supply: A Modeling Study,"Background-The ongoing yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola strains the global vaccine supply, prompting WHO to adopt dose sparing for its vaccination campaign in Kinshasa in July-August 2016. Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.","Yellow fever (YF) has resurged in Angola and threatens to spread to other countries with relatively low YF vaccine coverage. As of 8 July 2016, YF cases have been exported from Angola to Kenya (2 cases), China (11) , and DRC (59), raising concern that YF could resurge in other populations where competent vectors are present and vaccine coverage is low. 1, 2 Indeed, DRC has already declared a YF epidemic in Kinshasa and two other provinces. A broad band of sub-Saharan Africa north of Namibia and Zambia is at risk (http:// www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/africa.html), as is much of the northern portion of South America (http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/south_america.html). The global community is increasingly concerned for the risk of YF emergence in Asia, where the disease has been curiously absent despite seemingly amenable conditions."
Understanding Human Coronavirus HCoV-NL63,"Even though coronavirus infection of humans is not normally associated with severe diseases, the identification of the coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome showed that highly pathogenic coronaviruses can enter the human population. Shortly thereafter, in Holland in 2004, another novel human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a seven-month old infant suffering from respiratory symptoms. This virus has subsequently been identified in various countries, indicating a worldwide distribution. HCoV-NL63 has been shown to infect mainly children and the immunocommpromised, who presented with either mild upper respiratory symptoms (cough, fever and rhinorrhoea) or more serious lower respiratory tract involvement such as bronchiolitis and croup, which was observed mainly in younger children. In fact, HCoV-NL63 is the aetiological agent for up to 10% of all respiratory diseases. This review summarizes recent findings of human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 infections, including isolation and identification, phylogeny and taxonomy, genome structure and transcriptional regulation, transmission and pathogenesis, and detection and diagnosis.","Regardless of geographic location, respiratory tract infections rank among the top three killers of children under five years of age [1] . A significant proportion of these respiratory tract infections have no known cause. Recently, however, a number of novel coronaviruses have been identified as the causative agents for some of these infections [2, 3] ."
"Host-Primed Ebola Virus GP Exposes a Hydrophobic NPC1 Receptor- Binding Pocket, Revealing a Target for Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies","The filovirus surface glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral entry into host cells. Following viral internalization into endosomes, GP is cleaved by host cysteine proteases to expose a receptor-binding site (RBS) that is otherwise hidden from immune surveillance. Here, we present the crystal structure of proteolytically cleaved Ebola virus GP to a resolution of 3.3 Å. We use this structure in conjunction with functional analysis of a large panel of pseudotyped viruses bearing mutant GP proteins to map the Ebola virus GP endosomal RBS at molecular resolution. Our studies indicate that binding of GP to its endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 occurs in two distinct stages: the initial electrostatic interactions are followed by specific interactions with a hydrophobic trough that is exposed on the endosomally cleaved GP 1 subunit. Finally, we demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies targeting the filovirus RBS neutralize all known filovirus GPs, making this conserved pocket a promising target for the development of panfilovirus therapeutics.","cans and 12 to 17 predicted O-linked glycans (5) . Interior to the mucin-like domain is the glycan cap (GP 1 residues 227 to 313), which sits atop the GP 1 core. The glycan cap is more ordered than the mucin-like domain and contains four N-linked glycosylation sites. Neither the mucin nor the glycan cap domain is essential for viral entry. Indeed, removal of these domains enhances infection by viruses pseudotyped with EBOV GP (7) (8) (9) . Therefore, it is currently hypothesized that a primary function of the mucin domain and glycan cap is to shield the GP 1 core from immune surveillance (4, 5, 10, 11) ."
Homologue Scanning Mutagenesis Reveals CD66 Receptor Residues Required for Neisserial Opa Protein Binding,"The immunoglobulin-like family of CD66 antigens, present on human neutrophils and epithelial cells, are used as receptors for adhesins expressed by the pathogenic Neisseriae . N . gonorrhoeae strain MS11 can express 11 isoforms of these adhesins, called opacity-related (Opa) proteins. Each MS11 Opa protein recognizes a distinct spectrum of CD66 receptors. CD66-Opa binding is mediated by the NH 2 -terminal domain of the receptor and occurs through protein-protein interactions. In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis for the binding between the CD66 and Opa protein families by mapping amino acids in CD66 receptors that determine Opa protein binding. We performed homologue scanning mutagenesis between CD66e, which binds multiple Opa variants, and CD66b, which binds none, and tested both loss-offunction by CD66e and gain-of-function by CD66b in solution assays and in assays involving full-length receptors expressed by epithelial cells. We found that three residues in the CD66e N-domain are required for maximal Opa protein receptor activity. Opa proteins that recognize the same spectrum of native CD66 molecules showed differential binding of receptors with submaximal activity, indicating that the binding characteristics of these Opa proteins are actually slightly different. These data provide a first step toward resolving the structural requirements for Opa-CD66 interaction.","T he causative agent of gonorrhea, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo), 1 is an obligate human bacterial pathogen. The bacteria are thought to colonize the urogenital mucosa using different adhesins in a sequential manner. Initial attachment is mediated by gonococcal pili. Subsequently, tighter adherence to the mucosal epithelial cells is provided by bacterial adhesins called opacity-related (Opa) proteins (1, 2) . Both pathogenic Neisseria species, Ngo and Neisseria meningitidis (Nme), contain multiple opa genes. The expression of each opa gene can be turned on or off independently (phase variation) through a process of slipped-strand mispairing (3) . Members of the Opa protein family are highly homologous, except for variable sequence domains present in three of the four surface exposed loops (4) . Opa proteins were shown to account for the cell tropisms displayed by Ngo for human neutrophils and epithelial cells (5) . Two types of Opa protein receptors have been identified. One is the heparan-sulfate proteoglycan receptor (HSPG), present on epithelial cells, which mediates binding and internalization of one particular Opa variant of Ngo strain MS11 (OpaA [6, 7] ). The other receptor type include members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CD66 family, present on neutrophils and epithelial cells; they are recognized by multiple Opa variants of Ngo and Nme (8) (9) (10) (11) . The CD66 glycoprotein receptors belong to the Ig superfamily (IgSF): the molecules consist of one NH 2 -terminal Ig variable-like domain (N-domain) plus a varying number of Ig constant-like domains linked to the plasma membrane through a transmembrane domain or a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol moiety (12, 13) . The proteins were discovered decades ago when certain family members (CD66e [CEA] and CD66c) were found to be highly overexpressed in a large number of tumors; CEA has since become the prototype tumor marker. The function of CD66 glycoproteins in normal tissue or in tumorigenesis is still unclear, although the demonstration that these molecules function in vitro as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) may indicate that they contribute to tissue architecture or to other cell-cell interactions (14) . Interestingly, certain CD66 glycoproteins are subverted as receptors for bacterial ( Escherichia coli or Salmonella expressing type I pili [15] ) or viral (murine coronaviruses [16] ) pathogens; recently, the pathogenic Neisseriae have been added to this list. To date, five members of the CD66 family (CD66a-e) have been studied for their interaction with gonococcal Opa proteins. We and others have found that this interaction is highly differential, i.e., some CD66 family members are recognized by four Opa variants while other CD66 receptors are recognized by none (CD66b), six (CD66a), or nine (CD66e) different Opa variants of Ngo strain MS11 (10, 11, 17) . We recently showed that the differential interaction observed with native receptors expressed on epithelial cells is mimicked by the binding pattern of recombinant CD66 N-domains produced in E . coli (18) , indicating that the Opa-CD66 interaction is mediated by protein sequences in CD66 N-domains. It is remarkable that, despite extensive sequence similarity among the CD66a-e N-domains (71-90% amino acid sequence identity; see Fig. 1 A) , the N-domains are recognized by different groups of Opa proteins. In our effort to understand the differential Opa-CD66 interactions, we investigated the molecular basis for the binding between the Opa and CD66 protein families. Homologue scanning mutagenesis, a strategy chosen to preserve structural integrity of mutant molecules (19) , was used to map key residues in CD66 required for Opa protein binding. Residues within the N-domain of CD66e (which binds most Opa variants) were switched to homologous amino acids of the N-domain of CD66b (which does not bind any Opa variant). The key residues identified through loss-offunction mutations were confirmed by gain-of-function experiments, whereby the CD66b protein was converted into a functional receptor for Opa variants."

However, hypodermic needles are utilized primarily in the clinic or at home by patients who have received special training, and safe needle disposal 2 and other issues such as transportation are problems. 3 Conventional transdermal drug delivery offers many important advantages, such as accessibility, safety, painless drug administration, potential for self-administration, and avoidance of enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract or liver, but shows low bioavailability and poor permeability of drugs because of the physical barrier of the stratum corneum. 4, 5 For parenteral controlled-release formulations, in situ-forming implants are also attractive alternatives to preformed implants and microparticles, avoiding the use of large needles or microsurgery and with relatively low cost of manufacture. Such a system stays in a solid state before administration and becomes a hydrogel in situ after injection into the body. However, key issues remain to be solved, including variability of the implant shape and structure, avoidance of burst release during implant formation, and toxicity issues, thus these are far from practical use. 6 Recently, Peng et al combined nanoparticle and thermosensitive hydrogel technologies in an appropriate manner, which would be a promising system for longer sustained and controlled drug delivery. 7 However, compared to microneedle technologies, the promising system might have lower patient compliance and transportation convenience.

Murine Cytomegalovirus Is Regulated by a Discrete Subset of Natural Killer Cells Reactive with Monoclonal Antibody to Ly49H,"Antiviral roles of natural killer (NK) cell subsets were examined in C57BL/6 mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and other viruses, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), vaccinia virus (VV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Each virus vigorously induced an NK cell infiltrate into the peritoneal cavity and liver, causing some redistributions of NK cell subsets defined by monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against Ly49A, C/I, D, and G2. Striking results were seen with a mAb (1F8) reactive with the positively signaling molecule Ly49H, present in MCMV-resistant C57BL/6 mice. mAb 1F8 also stains Ly49 C and I, but exclusion of those reactivities with mAb 5E6, which recognizes Ly49 C and I, indicated that Ly49H ϩ cells infiltrated the peritoneal cavity and liver and were particularly effective at synthesizing interferon ␥ . Depletion of 1F8 ϩ but not 5E6 ϩ cells in vivo by mAb injections enhanced MCMV titers by 20-1,000-fold in the spleen and approximately fivefold in the liver. Titers of LCMV or VV were not enhanced. These anti-MCMV effects were attributed to prototypical NK1.1 ϩ CD3 Ϫ NK cells and not to NK1.1 ϩ CD3 ϩ ""NK/T"" cells. This is the first evidence that control of a virus infection in vivo is mediated by a distinct NK cell subset.","NK cells represent up to 15% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and can reach high concentrations at sites of inflammation, but despite their discovery 25 yr ago, convincing evidence for their importance has only been established in a limited number of systems (1) . Although proposed to mediate immunoregulatory and tumor surveillance functions, their primary role, like that of the rest of the immune system, is most likely to combat infectious agents. To do so, they may need the capacity to selectively recognize and attack infected host cells or else to nonselectively respond to stimuli and mediate effector function by the nonspecific release of cytokines. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NK cell recognition of target cells has been developed after the identification of a series of families of NK cell receptor (NKR) * molecules that can deliver either negative or positive signals to NK cells on encounter with a target (2) (3) (4) . Many of these receptor molecules recognize MHC class I antigens, but the possibility remains that some might also recognize other cell surface structures."
Intravenous vitamin C as adjunctive therapy for enterovirus/rhinovirus induced acute respiratory distress syndrome,"We report a case of virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated with parenteral vitamin C in a patient testing positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus on viral screening. This report outlines the first use of high dose intravenous vitamin C as an interventional therapy for ARDS, resulting from enterovirus/rhinovirus respiratory infection. From very significant preclinical research performed at Virginia Commonwealth University","Fowler Ⅲ AA et al . Intravenous vitamin C to treat ARDS with vitamin C and with the very positive results of a previously performed phase Ⅰ safety trial infusing high dose vitamin C intravenously into patients with severe sepsis, we reasoned that infusing identical dosing to a patient with ARDS from viral infection would be therapeutic. We report here the case of a 20-year-old, previously healthy, female who contracted respiratory enterovirus/rhinovirus infection that led to acute lung injury and rapidly to ARDS. She contracted the infection in central Italy while on an 8-d spring break from college. During a return flight to the United States, she developed increasing dyspnea and hypoxemia that rapidly developed into acute lung injury that led to ARDS. When support with mechanical ventilation failed, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. Twelve hours following ECMO initiation, high dose intravenous vitamin C was begun. The patient's recovery was rapid. ECMO and mechanical ventilation were discontinued by day-7 and the patient recovered with no long-term ARDS sequelae. Infusing high dose intravenous vitamin C into this patient with virus-induced ARDS was associated with rapid resolution of lung injury with no evidence of post-ARDS fibroproliferative sequelae. Intravenous vitamin C as a treatment for ARDS may open a new era of therapy for ARDS from many causes."
"Identification of functional, endogenous programmed À1 ribosomal frameshift signals in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae","In viruses, programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 PRF) signals direct the translation of alternative proteins from a single mRNA. Given that many basic regulatory mechanisms were first discovered in viral systems, the current study endeavored to: (i) identify À1 PRF signals in genomic databases, (ii) apply the protocol to the yeast genome and (iii) test selected candidates at the bench. Computational analyses revealed the presence of 10 340 consensus À1 PRF signals in the yeast genome. Of the 6353 yeast ORFs, 1275 contain at least one strong and statistically significant À1 PRF signal. Eight out of nine selected sequences promoted efficient levels of PRF in vivo. These findings provide a robust platform for high throughput computational and laboratory studies and demonstrate that functional À1 PRF signals are widespread in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data generated by this study have been deposited into a publicly available database called the PRFdb. The presence of stable mRNA pseudoknot structures in these À1 PRF signals, and the observation that the predicted outcomes of nearly all of these genomic frameshift signals would direct ribosomes to premature termination codons, suggest two possible mRNA destabilization pathways through which À1 PRF signals could post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA abundance.","Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a translational recoding phenomenon historically associated with viruses and retrotransposons. A PRF signal stochastically redirects translating ribosomes into a new reading frame (i.e. by +1 or À1 nt) and, in the typical viral context, these signals allow ribosomes to bypass the usual in-frame stop codon and continue synthesis of a C-terminally extended fusion protein. As with most basic molecular mechanisms, although first described in viruses, it is becoming increasingly apparent that PRF is much more widespread and is likely employed by organisms representing every branch in the tree of life [for reviews see (1) (2) (3) (4) ]."

Respiratory syncytial virus-associated illness in adults with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure,"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as a serious pathogen in people with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Immunoprophylaxis might be considered for adults at high-risk for frequent and severe RSV infection. Thus, we studied the incidence of RSV-related medically attended acute respiratory illness (MARI) in adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or congestive heart failure (CHF).","obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) affect millions of people worldwide and have been identified as risk factors for severe RSV infection. 2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In addition, these patients may present primarily with symptoms of decompensated heart failure or acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), and the role of viral infection is unappreciated. 11 Although molecular diagnostic testing has markedly improved the recognition of RSV and other respiratory viruses in these settings, adult RSV remains an underrecognized problem."
Role of CD25 + CD4 + T cells in acute and persistent coronavirus infection of the central nervous system,"The influence of CD25 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Treg) on acute and chronic viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined using a glial tropic murine coronavirus. Treg in the CNS were highest during initial T cell mediated virus control, decreased and then remained relatively stable during persistence. Anti-CD25 treatment did not affect CNS recruitment of inflammatory cells. Viral control was initially delayed; however, neither the kinetics of viral control nor viral persistence were affected. By contrast, the absence of Treg during the acute phase resulted in increased demyelination during viral persistence. These data suggest that CNS inflammation, progression of viral control and viral persistence are relatively independent of CD25 + CD4 + Treg. However, their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage.","Regulatory T cells (Treg) which express the Foxp3 transcription factor, neuropilin 1 (Nrp-1) and the IL-2 receptor (CD25) comprise ~10% of CD4 + T cells in the naïve animal and play an essential role in regulating the immune response to infection, progression of clinical disease and tissue damage (Langier et al., 2010; Lourenco and La Cava, 2011; Rouse et al., 2006; Rowe et al., 2012) . During viral infection the host is challenged to mount an effective anti-viral immune response while minimizing immune mediated damage. Exuberant T cell effector function and tissue damage are regulated by sustained natural Treg (nTreg), induction of antigen specific Foxp3 + Treg (iTreg), secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 − T cells, as well as inhibitory ligand receptor"
Brief Communication,"We implemented a carbapenem-saving strategy in hemato-oncology patients from 2013, using an empirical combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin for high-risk hemato-oncology patients with febrile neutropenia, who remain hemodynamically unstable > 72 hours despite initial cefepime treatment. All-cause mortality was not different between the two periods (6.54 and 6.57 deaths per 1,000 person-day, P = 0.926). Group 2 carbapenem use significantly decreased after strategy implementation (78.43 vs. 67.43 monthly days of therapy, P = 0.018), while carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli did not show meaningful changes during the study period. Our carbapenem-saving strategy could effectively suppress carbapenem use without an increase of overall mortality.","in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. We recommended empirical administration of PTZ/AMK to high-risk hemato-oncology patients with febrile neutropenia, 2 who remain hemodynamically unstable > 72 hours despite initial cefepime treatment and had no identification of any pathogenic organisms. This strategy was recommended by consultation and resident education without compulsory protocol. Although the carbapenem-saving strategy was applied to patients with febrile neutropenia, its effect on the amount of prescribed antibiotics and resistant pathogen was evaluated in the overall hemato-oncology patients because of the following reasons: 1) antibiotic use during febrile neutropenia would affect patients' flora and influence antimicrobial resistance of the following infections after the recovery from neutropenia, and 2) because hemato-oncology patients are admitted almost exclusively in hemato-oncology wards, resistant pathogens could be shared between patients through environment."

RT-PCR had 10 0 -10 3 -fold higher sensitivity than the Dipstick. NGS using thirteen RT-PCR-negative fecal samples revealed that all samples yielded RVA reads and especially that two of them covered all 11 genome segments.

VP4 and VP7 are the outer capsid proteins that independently elicit neutralizing antibodies, which mediate protective immunity [3] . Serotype is defined by a classification based on the neutralization of viral infectivity; however, the serotype of a rotavirus isolate can be predicted from the sequence of these regions [5] . Hence, genotyping is important for the clinician and diagnostician to obtain such information to interpret the results of vaccine studies and epidemiologic surveillance [6, 7] ."
HIV-1 frameshift efficiency is primarily determined by the stability of base pairs positioned at the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) requires a programmed À1 ribosomal frameshift for Pol gene expression. The HIV frameshift site consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) followed by a spacer region and a downstream RNA stem-loop structure. Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the À1 frameshift. The stem-loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3-4 bp in the stem-loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","Translation is a high-fidelity process in all organisms. Failure to maintain reading frame typically results in incorrect protein synthesis and/or early termination. However, a programmed change in reading frame can result in the translation of new proteins, thereby maximizing genomic coding capacity. Many retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (1) , and some coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (2) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (3), use a programmed À1 ribosomal frameshift (À1 PRF) to control translation levels of their enzymatic proteins (4) (5) (6) (7) . In the retroviruses, the À1 PRF site lies between the gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs), with pol in the À1 reading frame relative to gag. The gag ORF encodes the viral structural proteins, whereas the pol ORF encodes the enzymatic proteins. During translation of HIV-1 mRNA, the majority of ribosomes terminate at a stop codon at the end of the gag ORF, producing the Gag polyprotein (2, 8) . However, the HIV À1 PRF induces $5% of ribosomes to shift into the À1 reading frame, thus producing the Gag-Pol polyprotein (1, (9) (10) (11) . The 5% frameshift efficiency determines the ratio of viral proteins produced and is important for viral replication and infectivity (10, (12) (13) (14) (15) . A decrease in frameshift efficiency can inhibit viral replication (16, 17) ."
Emerging infectious disease laboratory and diagnostic preparedness to accelerate vaccine development,"Rapid vaccine development in response to an outbreak of a new emerging infectious disease (EID) is a goal targeted by public health agencies worldwide. This goal becomes more complicated when there are no standardized sets of viral and immunological assays, no accepted and well-characterized samples, standards or reagents, and no approved diagnostic tests for the EID pathogen. The diagnosis of infections is of critical importance to public health, but also in vaccine development in order to track incident infections during clinical trials, to differentiate natural infection responses from those that are vaccine-related and, if called for by study design, to exclude subjects with prior exposure from vaccine efficacy trials. Here we review emerging infectious disease biological standards development, vaccine clinical assay development and trial execution with the recent experiences of MERS-CoV and Zika virus as examples. There is great need to establish, in advance, the standardized reagents, sample panels, controls, and assays to support the rapid advancement of vaccine development efforts in response to EID outbreaks.",The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a list of priority pathogens 1 as those diseases with high morbidity and mortality or with strong epidemic potential. One of the clear gaps affecting both public health efforts and vaccine development programs for any of these pathogens is a lack of standardized reagents and methods to test for evidence of current or prior infection.

In developing countries, viruses represent a considerable proportion of the pathogens associated with ARTI's, varying from 40-90% across studies. [2] [3] [4] The most frequently implicated viruses among children are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdV), human rhinoviruses (hRV), and human enteroviruses (hEV). Several recently discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and the human coronaviruses (hCoVs) (NL63 and OC43), have been identified as potential respiratory pathogens. In addition, 2 novel human polyomaviruses (Washington University virus [WU] and Karolinska Institute virus [KI]) have been detected in patients with respiratory infections. [5] [6] [7] Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI's) are the most severe forms of infection and cause of approximately 1.9 million annual deaths among children, 8 while upper respiratory tract infections (URTI's) are the most frequent presentation of respiratory infections. An estimated 50% of all illnesses in all age groups, and approximately 75% of illnesses in young children are viral URTI's. 9 Proper diagnosis of viral ARTI's has been shown to reduce the misuse of antibiotics and shorten the length of hospital stay. However, current challenges in detecting respiratory viruses include inconsistent clinical manifestations of viral RTI's and variable sensitivity and specificity of available diagnostic assays. The traditional diagnostic methods for the respiratory viruses including cell culture and direct immunofluorescence assays are time consuming and technically demanding. 10 Several types of molecular biological methods, including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), PCR-hybridization, and real time PCR, have been introduced as more rapid and sensitive detection methods for respiratory infections. 3, 5, [11] [12] [13] Most studies in Saudi Arabia focused on a small number of viral pathogens, and information on the relative contribution of each pathogen to clinical forms of ARTI's is incomplete. [14] [15] [16] Hence, the aims of our study were to investigate the distribution of 15 respiratory viruses in children with ARTI's using multiplex RT-PCR, and to evaluate the presenting clinical, demographic, and epidemiological features of these different viral infections."
Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus H5N1 non-structural protein 1 is associated with apoptotic activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway,"Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an essential virulence factor of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and of the apoptosis associated with the pathogenesis of H5N1. Previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein is able to induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. However, it remains unclear whether the intrinsic pathway is also associated with this apoptosis. The present study used a clone of the NS1 gene from avian influenza A/Jiangsu/1/2007 and observed the localization of the NS1 protein and cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was detected using an MTT assay and the number of apoptotic cells was counted using a flow cytometer. Following the isolation of mitochondria, western blotting was performed to compare cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in cells before and after apoptosis. The change of MMP was detected using JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the results reveal that the majority of the NS1 protein was localized in the cell nucleus, and that it may induce apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells. The apoptosis occurred with marked cytochrome c release from mitochondria and a change of the MMP. This indicated that the NS1 protein may be associated with apoptosis induced by an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.","Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus is a highly pathogenic contagious agent that causes severe impairment in poultry and humans, particularly limited person-to-person transmission (1) . The cumulative number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 from 14 countries between November 2003 and July 2014 reached 667, 393 of which were fatal according to a report issued by the World Health Organization (2). In total, 47 individuals infected with H5N1 were identified in China and 30 (63.8%) succumbed to the H5N1 infection (2). H5N1 causes primary viral pneumonia with rapid progression to lung failure following invasion of epithelial cells in the upper and lower respiratory tracts (3) . However, the exact mechanism for elucidating the severity of human H5N1 infection remains unclear. Previously, apoptosis was not only observed in the alveolar epithelial cells of 2 patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection, but was also induced by H5N1 in numerous cell types in vivo and in vitro (4) (5) (6) . These results indicated that apoptosis may be important in H5N1 pathogenesis in the human body."
A sensitive array-based assay for identifying multiple TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene variants,"Studies of gene fusions in solid tumors are not as extensive as in hematological malignancies due to several technical and analytical problems associated with tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest in the role of fusion genes in common epithelial tumors after the discovery of recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer. Among all of the reported fusion partners in the ETS gene family, TMPRSS2:ERG is the most prevalent one. Here, we present a simple and sensitive microarray-based assay that is able to simultaneously determine multiple fusion variants with a single RT-PCR in impure RNA specimens. The assay detected TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts with a detection sensitivity of _10 cells in the presence of more than 3000 times excess normal RNA, and in primary prostate tumors having no`1% of cancer cells. The ability to detect multiple transcript variants in a single assay is critically dependent on both the primer and probe designs. The assay should facilitate clinical and basic studies for fusion gene screening in clinical specimens, as it can be readily adapted to include multiple gene loci.","Chromosome rearrangements are a characteristic feature of cancer. More than 350 gene fusions, as a consequence of chromosome aberrations, have been identified (1) . While gene fusions are common in hematological malignancies, their presence in solid tumors is not as well studied due to several technical and analytic problems related to tumor heterogeneity (1) . Only very limited gene fusion events were discovered in solid tumors, mostly in sarcomas, until the recent discovery of TMPRSS2:ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer (2) . This finding has since changed the general view that gene fusions play only a minor role in the pathogenesis of epithelial tumors. Therefore, there is renewed interest in searching for fusion genes in solid tumors, due to their potential impact on basic research and clinical application as has been demonstrated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (3, 4) ."
IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2018 207 Artificial Intelligence in Public Health and Epidemiology,"To introduce and summarize current research in the field of Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics. Methods: The 2017 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics was searched in PubMed and Web of Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 14 candidate best papers. These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to provide the editorial team with an enlightened vision to select the best papers. Results: Among the 843 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, two were finally selected as best papers. The first one analyzes the relationship between the disease, social/ mass media, and public emotions to understand public overreaction (leading to a noticeable reduction of social and economic activities) in the context of a nation-wide outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea in 2015. The second paper concerns a new methodology to de-identify patient notes in electronic health records based on artificial neural networks that outperformed existing methods. Conclusions: Surveillance is still a productive topic in public health informatics but other very important topics in Public Health are appearing. For example, the use of artificial intelligence approaches is increasing.","As quoted in the synopsis of the Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics section of the 2017 IMIA Yearbook [1] , precision public/global health and digital epidemiology are terms that are still in use in 2018 [2, 3] . The first term is about providing the right intervention to the right population at the right time [2] . The second term is about the use of digital data, especially those that were not collected on purpose, to answer epidemiologic questions [3] . Both refer to the unforeseen opportunities provided by our digital world and new technologies. Although genomics (and more broadly any ""-omics"") data continue to contribute, as it is the case for precision medicine, there are many other sources of information that can be used: social networks, internet search engines, cell phone data, electronic health data, and more. The challenge today is to analyze these big data in a meaningful way. One recently improved method that showed very nice success especially in image analysis is deep learning [4] . Applications of this method appear to be only limited by the quantity of information available. Predicting the unplanned readmission at the hospital within 6 months based on electronic health data [5] , de-identifying electronic health records (EHRs) [6] , analyzing social media [7] [8] [9] are various types of applications relevant in epidemiology and public health. But artificial intelligence covers many other techniques, such as machine learning approaches and statistical learning that offer a panel of methods which usefulness is only limited by pairing them with the right question; the two best papers of this year section are very good examples [6, 7] . Naïvely mining any large dataset will not give immediate answers. Epidemiologic approaches start with clever and appropriate questions, careful collection of relevant data with the most appropriate design, and validation of the results."
"Open Forum Infectious Diseases Transmission of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children Under 5 Years in Households of Rural Communities, the Philippines","To develop a more effective vaccination strategy for reducing the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, especially in young infants (<6 months old), it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of RSV.","The RSV infection incidence is generally high in young infants (<6 months old) [4] , who are prone to severe diseases due to physical and immunological immaturity [5] . However, because the neutralizing antibody response is low in young infants, vaccines that mimic natural infection may be ineffective if administered to infants before they reach 4 months of age [6] . Maternal antibodies are associated with a lower risk of infection in infants when antibody titers are maintained above the level considered protective during early infancy [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, an alternative vaccination strategy would be to transfer high concentrations of RSV-specific antibody via maternal vaccination, which could provide protection to infants up to 6 months of age, and to combine this approach with active vaccination in infants [10] ."
Identification of a Subdomain of CENPB That Is Necessary and Sufficient for Localization to the Human Centromere,"We have combined in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate the function of CENP-B, a major protein of human centromeric heterochromatin . Expression of epitope-tagged deletion derivatives of CENP-B in HeLa cells revealed that a single domain <158 residues from the amino terminus of the protein is sufficient to localize CENP-B to centromeres. Centromere localization was abolished if as few as 28 amino acids were removed from the amino terminus of CENP-B. The centromere localization signal of CENP-B T HE centromere (primary constriction) of human mitotic chromosomes consists ofa compacted network of heterochromatin containing highly repeated satellite DNA sequences and their associated proteins. The kinetochore, the site of microtubule attachment to the chromosomes (Luykx, 1965 ; Brinkley and Stubblefield, 1966; Jokelainen, 1967) , is situated at the surface of the centromeric heterochromatin . The kinetochore is now believed to be the location of the mechanochemical motors (such as dynein) (Pfarr et al ., 1990 ; Steuer et al., 1990; Wordernan et al., 1991) that move chromosomes in mitosis . Both gene expression and recombination are strongly suppressed in regions of heterochromatin (Brown, 1966; Henikoff, 1981; Daniels et al., 1986) . The interrelationship between the kinetochore and the underlying heterochromatin is unknown .","can function in an autonomous fashion, relocating a fused bacterial enzyme to centromeres . The centromere localization domain of CENP-B specifically binds in vitro to a subset of a-satellite DNA monomers. These results suggest that the primary mechanism for localization of CENP-B to centromeres involves the recognition of a DNA sequence found at centromeres . Analysis of the distribution of this sequence in a-satellite DNA suggests that CENP-B binding may have profound effects on chromatin structure at centromeres . and Rothfield, 1985) . CENP-B remains the best-characterized centromere protein (Earnshaw et al., 1987) . Variability in staining ofthe different chromosomes by CENP-B-specific antibodies initially led to the suggestion that binding of the protein to centromeres might be determined by DNA sequence (Earnshaw et al., 1987) . In confirmation of this, CENP-B was recently shown to bind specifically to a 17-bp sequence (termed the CENP-B box) present in some «-satellite DNA monomers, but not in others (Masumoto et al ., 1989) . CENP-B binds only to monomers containing the CENP-B box . The amount of CENP-B present at different centromeres varies because of differences in the sequence composition of the a-satellite DNA (Willard and Waye, 1987) ."
Anthropogenic factors and the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: prospects from a spatial-based model,"Beginning in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread across Southeast Asia, causing unprecedented epidemics. Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the ''second wave'' of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of freegrazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained.","(Received 23 July 2009; accepted 11 December 2009) Abstract -Beginning in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread across Southeast Asia, causing unprecedented epidemics.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection in Dromedary Camels in Saudi Arabia,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is proposed to be a zoonotic disease; however, the reservoir and mechanism for transmission of the causative agent, the MERS coronavirus, are unknown. Dromedary camels have been implicated through reports that some victims have been exposed to camels, camels in areas where the disease has emerged have antibodies to the virus, and viral sequences have been recovered from camels in association with outbreaks of the disease among humans. Nonetheless, whether camels mediate transmission to humans is unresolved. Here we provide evidence from a geographic and temporal survey of camels in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that MERS coronaviruses have been circulating in camels since at least 1992, are distributed countrywide, and can be phylogenetically classified into clades that correlate with outbreaks of the disease among humans. We found no evidence of infection in domestic sheep or domestic goats.","Clusters of human infection indicate that human-to-human MERS-CoV transmission can occur (4, 5) . However, the origin of the infection in most cases remains unknown. Analysis of human MERS-CoV sequences by Cotten et al. has revealed the presence of at least three circulating genotypes within the KSA alone (6) . Phylogenetic analyses of 13 complete and 8 partial genome sequences enabled estimates of the timing and geographic origins of individual viral clades. The authors proposed that MERS-CoV emerged in humans in 2011 and noted that sequence divergence between clades is consistent with several sporadic introductions of the virus into the human population, presumably from an animal reservoir."
The UNITAID Patent Pool Initiative: Bringing Patents Together for the Common Good,"Developing and delivering appropriate, affordable, well-adapted medicines for HIV/AIDS remains an urgent challenge: as first-line therapies fail, increasing numbers of people require costly second-line therapy; one-third of ARVs are not available in pediatric formulations; and certain key first-and second-line triple fixed-dose combinations do not exist or sufficient suppliers are lacking. UNITAID aims to help solve these problems through an innovative initiative for the collective management of intellectual property (IP) rights -a patent pool for HIV medicines. The idea behind a patent pool is that patent holders -companies, governments, researchers or universities -voluntarily offer, under certain conditions, the IP related to their inventions to the patent pool. Any company that wants to use the IP to produce or develop medicines can seek a license from the pool against the payment of royalties, and may then produce the medicines for use in developing countries (conditional upon meeting agreed quality standards). The patent pool will be a voluntary mechanism, meaning its success will largely depend on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to participate and commit their IP to the pool. Generic producers must also be willing to cooperate. The pool has the potential to provide benefits to all.","Two pills a day: one in the morning, one at night. This straightforward treatment regimen for HIV/AIDS is currently the mainstay of treatment programmes in many developing countries. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) that combine two or more medicines into one pill have simplified AIDS treatment protocols, facilitated patient adherence and reduced the risk of drug resistance. Vigorous generic competition has reduced medicines prices to around US$ 87 for the first-line FDC of stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine -roughly 1% of the price a decade ago. These factors combined have helped make possible a ten-fold increase in access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in the developing world within the span of just six years."

Abbreviations used in this paper: CGN, cis-Golgi network; DPAP A, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A; TGN, trans-Golgi network.","tigated by examining the subcellular distribution of chimeric proteins in which the cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane domains of the TGN protein, TGN38, were substituted for the analogous domains of the plasma membrane protein, Tac. Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, the COOHterminal cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 was found to be sufficient for localization of the chimeric proteins to the TGN. Deletion analysis identified an l 1-amino acid segment containing the critical sequence, YQRL, as being sufficient for TGN localization. TGN localization was abrogated by mutation of the tyrosine or leu-cine residues in this sequence to alanine, or of the arginine residue to aspartate. In addition to specifying TGN localization, the ll-amino acid segment was active as an internalization signal, although the property of internalization alone was insufficient to confer TGN localization. Overexpression of chimeric proteins containing TGN localization determinants resulted in their detection at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles, and abolished detection of endogenous TGN38. These results suggest that discrete cytoplasmic determinants can mediate protein localization to the TGN, and reveal a novel role for tyrosine-based motifs in this process."
Flexibility-Not just for yoga anymore!,"Over the past few years, nucleosides have maintained a prominent role as one of the cornerstones of antiviral and anticancer therapeutics, and many approaches to nucleoside drug design have been pursued. One such approach involves flexibility in the sugar moiety of nucleosides, for example, in the highly successful anti-HIV and HBV drug tenofovir. In contrast, introduction of flexibility to the nucleobase scaffold has only more recently gained significance with the invention of our fleximers. The history, development, and some biological relevance for this innovative class of nucleosides are detailed herein.","Nucleosides have played a prominent role in medicinal chemistry as one of the cornerstones of antiviral and anticancer therapeutics. [1] [2] [3] Because their structures are based on the naturally occurring nucleosides (Figure 1) , they have the ability to be recognized by biologically significant enzymes. As a result, even minor changes to the nucleoside scaffold can have profound effects-or can result in no activity at all."
Simultaneous detection of eleven sexually transmitted agents using multiplexed PCR coupled with MALDI-TOF analysis,"Purpose: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), representing a major global health problem, are caused by different microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for STIs.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a significant contributor to the global burden in public health and medical care. STIs can cause severe fetal and neonatal death, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and genital neoplasia. Despite leading to such severe complications, clinical and public health practice sometimes underestimates the importance of diagnosing STIs, and moreover, for scientific research, STIs remain a neglected field. 1 Many STIs are often asymptomatic during the early infection stages, which increase the risk of unrecognized transmission. 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 357 million new infections of curable STIs occurred each year throughout the world (http://www.who. int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs110/en/). STIs are caused by different microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. 3 Therefore, it is important to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for STIs. In addition, rapid and accurate identification is critical for preventing onward transmission, offering immediate intervention, adopting early treatment, and reducing patient management costs. 4, 5 Conventional diagnostic algorithms for STIs include cell culture, microscopic examination, enzyme immunoassay, and other serological investigation techniques. [6] [7] [8] The diagnosis of STIs by culture or serology remains a challenge. 9 Especially for herpes simplex virus and Treponema pallidum detection, cell culture shows low-sensitivity and long turnaround time, making this assay clinically useless. 10, 11 However, over the past two decades, molecular testing has been widely used to detect pathogens associated with STIs. Compared with traditional methods, molecular tests, such as PCR, real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, and microarray, have rapid turnaround times and superior sensitivities. 3, 7, 12 Several commercial kits or systems based on nucleic acid amplification have been developed to detect pathogens responsible for STIs, [13] [14] [15] [16] but these systems still have disadvantages, such as high cost, low sample throughput, and the limited number of pathogens that can be detected in a single test reaction. 3 In this study, the MassARRAY System (Agena Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), a detection platform combining endpoint multiplex-PCR with matrixassisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), was utilized to develop a sexually transmitted infection assay (STI-MS) that can simultaneously detect and identify common clinical pathogens implicated in STIs, including herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Haemophilus ducreyi. Three controversial microorganisms (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum), still not conclusive evidence whether these agents should be considered pathogens, were also included in the panel in our study. The system comes with some considerable benefits of multiplexing and high throughput, and it has been applied successfully in detecting and confirming various kinds of microbes. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] For each microorganisms included in the STI-MS assay, two different genes were selected as targets. If either of the genes were detected, the corresponding organisms were positive. Such a strategy can avoid false-negative results, thus making our method more sensitive and comprehensive. The performance of the STI-MS was evaluated using clinical specimens from patients with sexually transmitted infections. All STI-MS results were confirmed by real-time PCR and nested PCR. Discordant results were arbitrated by an ultrasensitive digital PCR method."
Advances and Applications in Bioinformatics and Chemistry Dovepress Identification of highly conserved regions in L-segment of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and immunoinformatic prediction about potential novel vaccine,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope ""DCSSTPPDR"" was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of the hemorrhagic fever, which was first described in Cremia in 1945. 1 The virus consists of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA, and its tripartite genome comprises the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, which encode the viral nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein precursor, and polymerase-L proteins, respectively. 2 Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East are the hotspots of this viral infection, with a high fatality rate between 15% and 70%. 3, 4 In case of human infection, the progression of this disease is very rapid and it causes acute febrile illness, associated with petechiae, ecchymosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure. 5 A wide range of ticks that belong to the Hyalomma genus are considered the main vectors of this viral disease and the disease is spread through the bite of these ticks to humans or other domestic animals. 6 Due to inadequate hospital care, the disease is also spread nosocomially and a case reported that, in South Africa, about 33% medical personnel are infected through needlestick injury. 7 Alternate routes of infection, such as aerosol and droplet respiratory route of infection, were also suspected for several cases in Russia. 8 With a broad geographic distribution, Oany et al this virus already covers .30 countries across Africa, southeastern Europe, the Middle East, western Asia, and more recently, some places of southwestern Europe, particularly Spain. [9] [10] [11] The wide distribution of this virus indicates the ability of the tick hosts to adapt across different environmental and geographic regions. 12 Despite the outbreaks, there is no reliable vaccine or drug for the treatment of CCHFV infection in animals or humans. 13 As a single-stranded-RNA-containing genome and due to the error-prone nature of its polymerase, the CCHFV incorporates random mutations into the genome. The rate of recombination in its RNA is also very high. As a consequence, the development of a vaccine or antiviral drug against CCHFV is very difficult. 14 The design of epitope-based vaccines against some deadly viruses has gained much popularity due to its increased potency and safety. 15, 16 The application of bioinformatics in immunology, which is also termed immunoinformatics, is now widely accepted. Immunoinformatics can assist in designing new vaccines through the identification of potential T-cell epitope, B-cell epitope, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. [17] [18] [19] This novel approach has proven its efficacy in the case of multiple sclerosis, 20 malaria, 21 human immunodeficiency virus, 22 and tuberculosis, 23 with desired results. In our present study, we have proposed the design of a potential conserved epitope candidate through the immunoinformatics approaches in order to minimize the fatal effects of the CCHFV, with the expectation of finding a novel candidate for the vaccine via wet laboratory validation."
Taiwan's Experience in Hospital Preparedness and Response for Emerging Infectious Diseases,"Taiwan, has undergone several phases of modification in structure and activation. The main organizing principles of the CDCMN are centralized isolation of patients with severe highly infectious diseases and centralization of medical resources, as well as a network of designated regional hospitals like those in other countries. The CDCMN is made up of a command system, responding hospitals, and supporting hospitals. It was tested and activated in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009-10 and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2016, and it demonstrated high-level functioning and robust capacity. In this article, the history, structure, and operation of the CDCMN is introduced globally for the first time, and the advantages and challenges of this system are discussed. The Taiwanese experience shows an example of a collaboration between the public health system and the medical system that may help other public health authorities plan management and hospital preparedness for highly infectious diseases.","U nder the Global Health Security Agenda, hospital preparedness for highly infectious diseases is regarded as a critical strategy for disease control and prevention. Hospital preparedness is particularly important to protect healthcare workers and reduce transmission of diseases within hospitals. Following the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001, the SARS outbreak in 2003, and 2 decades of medical system reforms, a number of countries have adopted an approach that designates specific responding hospitals at the national, regional, and/or local levels to centralize resources, build capacity, and train special medical staff. In Japan, patients diagnosed with Category I communicable diseases are referred to designated infection hospitals. 1, 2 In Singapore, its largest hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, was appointed as the screening and treatment center for SARS and other emerging infectious diseases. 3, 4 The Hong Kong health authority established 6 hospital clusters for resource sharing and a continuum of quality care. 5 The European Commission founded the European Network of Infectious Diseases (ENID), including setting up high-level isolation units (HLIUs). 6 The US government made a new tiered hospital program in response to a domestic Ebola outbreak, designating 10 regional treatment centers and 45 state treatment centers for the management of patients with Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases. [7] [8] [9] After the SARS outbreak in 2003 in Taiwan, where a series of nosocomial outbreaks resulted in the collapse of hospital operations, a new medical network for highly infectious diseases, named the Communicable Diseases Control Medical Network (CDCMN), was established. It was funded through government mid-and long-term plans and had been modified in terms of the command system, how it is activated, and responding hospital criteria. In 2007, additional changes were made to enhance response effectiveness and coordination with regional and local medical facilities. This article describes the establishment and history of the CDCMN, the framework of the medical network, responses to the H1N1 pandemic and Ebola in West Africa, identification of its strengths and challenges, and how the system changed over time. An overview of Taiwan's hospital preparedness efforts is provided to help public health authorities in countries with similar programs or plans to improve hospital preparedness for highly infectious diseases."
Clinical predictors of chest radiographic abnor malities in young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis: a single center study,"Purpose: Chest radiography is often performed on patients hospitalized with typical clinical manife stations of bronchiolitis. We aimed to determine the proportion of subjects with pathologic chest radio graphic findings and the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis. Methods: We obtained the following data at admission: sex, age, neonatal history, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, heart rate, respiratory rate, the presence of fever, total duration of fever, oxygen saturation, laboratory parameters (i.e., complete blood cell count, highsensitivity Creactive protein [hsCRP], etc.), and chest radiography. Results: The study comprised 279 young children. Of these, 26 had a chest radiograph revealing opacity (n=24) or atelectasis (n=2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment for confounding factors, the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with bronchiolitis were elevated hsCRP level (>0.3 mg/dL) and past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (all P<0.05). Conclusion: The current study suggests that chest radiographs in young children with typical clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis have limited value. Nonetheless, young children with clinical factors such as high hsCRP levels at admission or past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses may be more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings.","Acute respiratory tract infection is one of the most common diseases encountered in the outpatient and/or Emergency Department settings in childhood 1) . Of these infections, bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among young children 2, 3) .

Another study looking at 1,503,239 children under 18 years of age who visited the Emergency Department in Korea in 2012 found that 18,313 children (1.2%) were diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 6,321 children of them (34.5%) were admitted 5) ."
Comments on Fouchier's Calculation of Risk and Elapsed Time for Escape of a Laboratory-Acquired Infection from His Laboratory,Citation Klotz LC. 2015. Comments on Fouchier's calculation of risk and elapsed time for escape of a laboratory-acquired infection from his laboratory. mBio 6(2):e00268-15.,"I n a Letter to the Editor of mBio, Professor Ron Fouchier published a calculation (1) in which he finds a very low probability, P 1 , for a laboratory-acquired infection (LAI) for a single lab for a single year. Claiming numerous safety precautions in his biosafety level 3 (BSL3ϩ) laboratory, Fouchier calculates P 1 ϭ 1 ϫ 10 -7 per person per year, and since there are 10 workers with access to his laboratory, P 1 ϭ 1 ϫ 10 -6 per lab per year. Compare this to P 1 ϭ 2 ϫ 10 -3 per lab per year for BSL3 laboratories calculated from CDC statistics for undetected or unreported LAIs (2, 3), here called ""community LAIs,"" as it is assumed that an undetected or unreported LAI represents an infection that has traveled outside the lab and into the community."
Membrane Protein Sorting in the Yeast Secretory Pathway: Evidence That the Vacuole May Be the Default Compartment,"The targeting signals of two yeast integral membrane dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs), DPAP B and DPAP A, which reside in the vacuole and the Golgi apparatus, respectively, were analyzed. No single domain of DPAP B is required for delivery to the vacuolar membrane, because removal or replacement of either the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or lumenal domain did not affect the protein's transport to the vacuole. DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the yeast Golgi apparatus. The 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type DPAP A. Overproduction of DPAP A resulted in its mislocaliza-tion to the vacuole, because cells expressing high levels of DPAP A exhibited vacuolar as well as Golgi staining. Deletion of 22 residues of the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocaiization of the mutant protein to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, and removal of the retention signal, or saturation of the retention apparatus by overproducing DPAP A, resulted in transport to the vacuole. Like wild type DPAP B, the delivery of mutant membrane proteins to the vacuole was unaffected in the secretory vesicle-blocked secl mutant; thus, transport to the vacuole was not via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis. These data are consistent with a model in which membrane proteins are delivered to the vacuole along a default pathway.","Ar~Y proteins that reside in the organelles of the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells have targeting information that directs retention in or sorting to the appropriate compartment (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . In the absence of retention or sorting signals, soluble proteins of the secretory pathway are secreted; thus, the default pathway for these proteins is secretion (Burgess and Kelly, 1987; Pelham, 1989) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in the targeting signal of the soluble vacuolar protein, carboxypeptidase Y (Vails et al., 1990) , or the retention signal of the soluble ER protein, BiP (Hardwick et al., 1990) , result in the secretion of these proteins. Likewise, the flow of membrane proteins to the cell surface of nonpolarized mammalian cells is apparently by default, because mutations that disrupt the retention of ER or Golgi-retained membrane proteins (Machamer et al., 1987; Machamer, 1991; Jackson et al., 1990) or the sorting of a lysosomal membrane protein (Williams and Fukuda, 1990) result in localization to the plasma membrane. Little is known regarding membrane protein sorting in S. cerevisiae, although a previous study suggested that the cell surface is the default compartment for membrane proteins (Fuller et al., 1989b) . In this paper, we characterize the targeting of two membrane proteins of the yeast secretory pathway, DAP dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) ~ DPAP A and DPAP B of the Golgi apparatus and vacuole, respectively."

"Generation of ""LYmph Node Derived Antibody Libraries"" (LYNDAL) for selecting fully human antibody fragments with therapeutic potential","chain variable fragment; VH, variable region of the heavy chain; VL, variable region of the light chain the development of efficient strategies for generating fully human monoclonal antibodies with unique functional properties that are exploitable for tailored therapeutic interventions remains a major challenge in the antibody technology field. Here, we present a methodology for recovering such antibodies from antigen-encountered human B cell repertoires. As the source for variable antibody genes, we cloned immunoglobulin G (IgG)-derived B cell repertoires from lymph nodes of 20 individuals undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer. Sequence analysis of unselected ""LYmph Node Derived Antibody Libraries"" (LYNDAL) revealed a naturally occurring distribution pattern of rearranged antibody sequences, representing all known variable gene families and most functional germline sequences. to demonstrate the feasibility for selecting antibodies with therapeutic potential from these repertoires, seven LYNDAL from donors with high serum titers against herpes simplex virus (HSV) were panned on recombinant glycoprotein B of HSV-1. Screening for specific binders delivered 34 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with unique sequences. Sequence analysis revealed extensive somatic hypermutation of enriched clones as a result of affinity maturation. Binding of scFvs to common glycoprotein B variants from HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains was highly specific, and the majority of analyzed antibody fragments bound to the target antigen with nanomolar affinity. From eight scFvs with HSV-neutralizing capacity in vitro, the most potent antibody neutralized 50% HSV-2 at 4.5 nM as a dimeric (scFv) 2 . We anticipate our approach to be useful for recovering fully human antibodies with therapeutic potential. www.landesbioscience.com mAbs 131 RepoRt RepoRt","Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become an integral part of modern treatment concepts for cancer, inflammation, immunological disorders, and infectious diseases. Fully human mAbs, carrying no xenogenic components and displaying most preferable pharmacokinetic profiles, have emerged as the fastest-growing group of therapeutic antibodies entering clinical trials. 1, 2 Since the first report of the production of a mouse mAb through employment of B cell hybridoma fusion techniques, 3 several powerful technologies for the generation of entirely human antibodies have been developed. 4, 5 These include noncombinatorial methodologies for the efficient immortalization of human B cells, 6, 7 the generation of stable human hybridomas, 8 and expression-cloning of physiological variable (V) gene pairings from blood-derived human B cells of infected individuals. 9 The vast majority of clinically-investigated fully human mAbs, however, are produced by either immunization of transgenic mice that are equipped with the human antibody gene repertoire, 10, 11 or by preparing human antibody phage display libraries. In the latter approach, random pairs of the variable genes of the heavy and light antibody chains (VH and VL, respectively) are cloned as combinatorial libraries involving bacteriophages for presentation of selectable antibody fragments. 12 Since the initial description of antibody phage display, 13 this technology has evolved into the most successful in vitro selection platform for human antibodies because it is robust, inexpensive, and offers great potential for automation. 14, 15 The first fully human phage display-derived mAbs have recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatic and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (adalimumab), systemic lupus erythematosus (belimumab), and inhalational anthrax infection (raxibacumab). Other phage display library-selected mAbs are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years."
"Systemic Spread and Propagation of a Plant-Pathogenic Virus in European Honeybees, Apis mellifera","Emerging and reemerging diseases that result from pathogen host shifts are a threat to the health of humans and their domesticates. RNA viruses have extremely high mutation rates and thus represent a significant source of these infectious diseases. In the present study, we showed that a plant-pathogenic RNA virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), could replicate and produce virions in honeybees, Apis mellifera, resulting in infections that were found throughout the entire body. Additionally, we showed that TRSV-infected individuals were continually present in some monitored colonies. While intracellular life cycle, species-level genetic variation, and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts remain to be determined, the increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses from spring toward winter in infected colonies was associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse, suggesting the negative impact of the virus on colony survival. Furthermore, we showed that TRSV was also found in ectoparasitic Varroa mites that feed on bee hemolymph, but in those instances the virus was restricted to the gastric cecum of Varroa mites, suggesting that Varroa mites may facilitate the spread of TRSV in bees but do not experience systemic invasion. Finally, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that TRSV isolates from bees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites clustered together, forming a monophyletic clade.","virus-negative colonies consumed virus-contaminated foods. This discovery raised concerns about a possible role of pollen in spreading viruses and suggested that viruses could possibly contribute to the observed pollinator decline around the world. In order to advance our understanding of the role of pollen in virus transmission of honeybees, we carried out a study to screen bees and pollen loads of bee colonies for the presence of frequent and rare viruses. Our study resulted in the serendipitous detection of a plant virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), in honeybees and prompted us to investigate whether this plant-infecting virus could cause systemic infection in exposed honeybees."
The requirement of environmental acidification for Ibaraki virus infection to host cells,"The effect of environmental acidification on Ibaraki virus (IBAV) infection was tested using endosomal inhibitory chemicals and low pH treatment. Treatment of target cells with endosomal inhibitors significantly decreased the progeny virus production. IBAV outer capsid proteins, VP5 and VP2, were removed from virion when purified IBAV was exposed to low pH environment. Further experiment showed that the exposure to low pH buffer facilitated IBAV infection when the cellular endosomal pathway was impaired by bafilomycin A1. Results obtained in this study suggest that acidic environment is essential to initiate IBAV infection.","Ibaraki virus (IBAV) is one of the strains of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) serotype 2, a member of genus Orbivirus in Reoviridae family [11, 19] . It is known as a causative agent of Ibaraki disease characterized by the paralysis of swallowing muscles. Although the effective vaccine is widely used, the recent reemergence of Ibaraki disease in combination with the co-circulation with other EHDV raised the alert level for the epidemic of Ibaraki disease [13] . In addition, orbivirus family contains many viruses causing severe loss in the livestock industry. Therefore, it is important to understand the detailed molecular mechanism of their infection."

Perspectives in veterinary medicine: Description and classification of bronchiolar disorders in cats,"This Perspectives in Veterinary Medicine article seeks to define, describe putative causes, and discuss key diagnostic tests for primary and secondary bronchiolar disorders to propose a classification scheme in cats with support from a literature review and case examples. The small airways (bronchioles with inner diameters <2 mm), located at the transitional zone between larger conducting airways and the pulmonary acinus, have been overlooked as major contributors to clinical syndromes of respiratory disease in cats. Because the trigger for many bronchiolar disorders is environmental and humans live in a shared environment with similar susceptibility, understanding these diseases in pet cats has relevance to One Health. Thoracic radiography, the major imaging modality used in the diagnostic evaluation of respiratory disease in cats, has low utility in detection of bronchiolar disease. Computed tomography (CT) with paired inspiratory and expiratory scans can detect pathology centered on small airways. In humans, treatment of bronchiolar disorders is not well established because of heterogeneous presentations and often late definitive diagnosis. A review of the human and veterinary medical literature will serve as the basis for a proposed classification scheme in cats. A case series of cats with CT or histopathologic evidence of bronchiolar lesions or both, either as a primary disorder or secondary to extension from large airway disease or interstitial lung disease, will be presented. Future multi-institutional and multidisciplinary discussions among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will help refine and develop this classification scheme to promote early and specific recognition and optimize treatment.","disease. Advances in understanding bronchiolar disorders in humans have been hampered by lack of a widely accepted classification scheme because of different viewpoints of clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists. In humans, bronchiolar disorders are classified by inciting cause (eg, infection, drug related, immune-mediated, or occupational or environmental exposures), clinical sequelae (eg, restrictive, obstructive, or mixed disorders), imaging, histologic features, or some combination of these. 11, 14, 15 Bronchiolar disease can be focal or diffuse, acute, or chronic, inflammatory or fibrotic, and confined to the lungs or develop as part of a variety of systemic diseases. 8, 9 In primary bronchiolar disorders, disease centers on bronchioles and spares other parts of the respiratory tract. In secondary bronchiolar disorders, disease extends to small airways from either the large airways or pulmonary parenchyma (eg, interstitial lung diseases [ILDs] ). 10 Bronchiolar disorders, although recognized in humans, have not yet been described as distinct clinical entities in veterinary medicine."
Interhospital Transport System for Critically Ill Patients: Mobile Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation without a Ventilator,"Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been successfully used as a method for the interhospital transportation of critically ill patients. In South Korea, a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system is lacking due to limited resources. We developed a simplified ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation for use by public emergency medical services. Methods: Eighteen patients utilized our ECMO transport system from December 2011 to September 2015. We retrospectively analyzed the indications for ECMO, the patient status during transport, and the patient outcomes. Results: All transport was conducted on the ground by ambulance. The distances covered ranged from 26 to 408 km (mean, 65.9±88.1 km) and the average transport time was 56.1±57.3 minutes (range, 30 to 280 minutes). All patients were transported without adverse events. After transport, 4 patients (22.2%) underwent lung transplantation because of interstitial lung disease. Eight patients who had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome showed recovery of heart and lung function after ECMO therapy. A total of 13 patients (70.6%) were successfully taken off ECMO, and 11 patients (61.1%) survived. Conclusion: Our ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation can be considered a safe and useful method for interhospital transport and could be a good alternative option for ECMO transport in Korean hospitals with limited resources.","Since the efficacy of transferring patients with severe respiratory failure to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) center was first reported, the safe and timely transfer of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has attracted increasing attention [1] . ECMO is being used more frequently as a treatment for severe ARDS, and the need for ECMO in transit has increased [2] . In particular, during the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, ECMO interhospital transport played a significant role in patients requiring transfer to an ECMO center for ARDS treatment. However, South Korea still lacks a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system due to limited resources. Recent advances in ECMO have suggested that ECMO can function as an alternative to a ven-Korean J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2017;50: [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] tilator for oxygenation. ECMO without mechanical ventilation has been used in a number of ARDS patients. In view of this, we have greatly simplified our ECMO transport system and have been operating our ECMO interhospital transport program without the use of mechanical ventilation [3] . During the planning stage of our ECMO transport program, our goal was to maximize the utilization of hospital staff and facilities and to develop an ECMO transport system using the public emergency medical services (EMS) systems. Our system was specifically designed to address the medical circumstances in South Korea and can be appropriately applied to other hospitals in South Korea. In this study, we review our experiences using an interhospital ECMO transport program without mechanical ventilation in a resource-limited environment."
The Independence of Ontario' s Public Health Units: Does Governing Structure Matter? Autonomie des bureaux de santé publique en Ontario : la structure de gouvernance a-t-elle une importance?,"Do autonomous health units fulfil their mandate better than ones that are integrated into municipal structures? Many observers of Ontario' s public health system seem to think so, but this assumption is based on very little evidence. This paper seeks to help fill this gap by grounding a comparison of the spending growth of two health units with different governing structures in the multilevel governance literature. The study finds that, after an increase in provincial funding, an autonomous health unit, the Middlesex-London Health Unit, behaved more in accordance with provincial expectations than Hamilton Public Health Services, which is integrated into the City of Hamilton. The paper contributes by providing theoretical and empirical explanations for variation among local health units.","Whenever problems emerge in Ontario's public health system, recommendations are made to make boards of health more autonomous from municipal control (Campbell 2004; Capacity Review Commission 2006) . Despite these repeated calls for structural change, little has been made. Moreover, very little research has been done to determine whether autonomous boards of health actually fulfil their legislative mandate better than boards that are integrated into municipal structures and controlled by municipal councils. There is, however, an emerging strand of the Canadian literature on multilevel governance that has explored these questions in other policy areas (Eidelman 2013; Filion and Sanderson 2014; Horak 2012; Lyons 2015a Lyons , 2015b Sanderson and Filion 2013) . The findings from this literature suggest that specialized jurisdictions, like conservation authorities, economic development agencies and waterfront re-development corporations, perform their mandate more faithfully than general-purpose governments. By comparing the spending growth of the Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) and Hamilton Public Health Services (HPHS), two similar health units with different governing structures, during a time when the capacity of Ontario's public health system was in question, this paper reports on whether the findings from these other policy areas are transferrable to the field of public health. Additionally, the findings provide public health policy makers a wider frame of reference as they continue to grapple with questions about board of health governance. The hypothesis was that the MLHU, which is an autonomous health unit, would behave more in accordance with provincial expectations than HPHS, which is integrated into the City of Hamilton's municipal structure."
"Optimization of human, animal, and environmental health by using the One Health approach","Emerging diseases are increasing burdens on public health, negatively affecting the world economy, causing extinction of species, and disrupting ecological integrity. One Health recognizes that human, domestic animal, and wildlife health are interconnected within ecosystem health and provides a framework for the development of multidisciplinary solutions to global health challenges. To date, most health-promoting interventions have focused largely on single-sector outcomes. For example, risk for transmission of zoonotic pathogens from bush-meat hunting is primarily focused on human hygiene and personal protection. However, bush-meat hunting is a complex issue promoting the need for holistic strategies to reduce transmission of zoonotic disease while addressing food security and wildlife conservation issues. Temporal and spatial separation of humans and wildlife, risk communication, and other preventative strategies should allow wildlife and humans to co-exist. Upstream surveillance, vaccination, and other tools to prevent pathogen spillover are also needed. Clear multi-sector outcomes should be defined, and a systems-based approach is needed to develop interventions that reduce risks and balance the needs of humans, wildlife, and the environment. The ultimate goal is long-term action to reduce forces driving emerging diseases and provide interdisciplinary scientific approaches to management of risks, thereby achieving optimal outcomes for human, animal, and environmental health.","Emerging infectious diseases, defined as novel or known infectious diseases increasing in incidence within a specific location or population, and environmental contaminants pose global and profound threats to human, animal, and environmental health [17, 32, 39] . The rise of emerging infectious diseases demonstrates the dynamic relationship among pathogens, hosts, and their environment [20, 32, 39] . Over sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and over seventy percent of those zoonoses have a wildlife origin [20] , including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), sylvatic plague, Lyme disease, anthrax, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). These diseases increase burdens on public health systems, negatively impact the world economy, cause declines and extinctions of animal species, and increase loss of ecological integrity [8, 23] . The potential global impact of a wildlife-associated pathogen on human health is exemplified by the over 35 million people currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is reported to have originated from a simian (primate) virus [13] . Likewise, negative effects of emerging and resurging diseases on agriculture, food safety and security, wildlife health, and human health in Southeast Asia have resulted from outbreaks of HPAI [16, 29, 40] . There are also several newly described pathogens and diseases that have resulted in wildlife population declines and global extinctions. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a cutaneous fungal infection of amphibians, is linked to global declines of amphibian populations [22] , and Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the etiologic agent of white-nose syndrome, has caused precipitous declines in the abundance of North American hibernating bat species [3] . Such large-scale losses of animal species and biodiversity subsequently jeopardize the ecosystems on which all life depends [7, 18] . Of particular concern are novel emerging infectious diseases of wildlife origin as they are difficult to anticipate, devastating to wildlife populations, challenging to manage, and have the potential to have ecological ripple effects. Emerging diseases and pathogens of wildlife origin are increasing globally at alarming rates, in both incidence and by geographic location, which can be largely attributed to the driving forces of globalization, an increasing human population, and climate change [8, 20, 23, 48] ."
Agreement Among 4 Sampling Methods to Identify Respiratory Pathogens in Dairy Calves with Acute Bovine Respiratory Disease,"Background: Four sampling techniques commonly are used for antemortem identification of pathogens from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD): the nasal swab (NS), guarded nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and transtracheal wash (TTW). Agreement among these methods has not been well characterized.","B ovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves, 1 which has long-term consequences including decreased milk production, poor reproductive performance, and poor growth and longevity. 2-4 Although management practices such as commingling and group housing increase BRD risk, viral and bacterial pathogens cause the lesions characteristic of BRD. Monitoring and testing for pathogens associated with BRD may facilitate the development of appropriate, targeted vaccination programs. Moreover, recent identification of multidrugresistant M. haemolytica from BRD cases 5 indicates that it may be informative for veterinarians to monitor cattle with BRD for the presence of resistant bacterial pathogens."
Cell-Type-Specific Effects of RNase L on Viral Induction of Beta Interferon,"The interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral state is mediated in part by the 2=,5=-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)/ RNase L system. 2-5A, produced from ATP by OAS proteins in response to viral double-stranded RNA, binds to and activates RNase L. RNase L restricts viral infections by degrading viral and cellular RNA, inducing autophagy and apoptosis, and producing RNA degradation products that amplify production of type I interferons (IFNs) through RIG-I-like receptors. However, the effects of the OAS/RNase L pathway on IFN induction in different cell types that vary in basal levels of these proteins have not been previously reported. Here we report higher basal expression of both RNase L and OAS in mouse macrophages in compari-","tem is a uniquely regulated innate immune pathway that restricts viral infections (reviewed in reference 1). The interferon (IFN) inducible OAS family of proteins include pathogen recognition receptors for viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that synthesize 2-5A from ATP. In mice, the enzymatically active species of OAS include OAS1a, OAS2, and OAS3 (reviewed in reference 2). 2-5A binds with high affinity and specificity to the latent cytoplasmic endoribonuclease, RNase L, causing its dimerization and activation (3) . RNase L then cleaves both viral and cellular singlestranded regions of RNA, predominantly at UpU and UpA dinucleotides (4), leading to inhibition of viral replication in vivo (5) ."
Imino sugar glucosidase inhibitors as broadly active anti-filovirus agents,"Ebola virus and Marburg virus are members of the family of Filoviridae and are etiological agents of a deadly hemorrhagic fever disease. The clinical symptoms of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers are difficult to distinguish and there are currently no specific antiviral therapies against either of the viruses. Therefore, a drug that is safe and effective against both would be an enormous breakthrough. We and others have shown that the folding of the glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses, including the filoviruses, is far more dependent upon the calnexin pathway of protein folding than are most host glycoproteins. Drugs that inhibit this pathway would be expected to be selectively antiviral. Indeed, as we summarize in this review, imino sugars that are competitive inhibitors of the host endoplasmic reticular a-glucosidases I and II, which are enzymes that process N-glycan on nascent glycoproteins and thereby inhibit calnexin binding to the nascent glycoproteins, have been shown to have antiviral activity against a number of enveloped viruses including filoviruses. In this review, we describe the state of development of imino sugars for use against the filoviruses, and provide an explanation for the basis of their antiviral activity as well as limitations.","INTRODUCTION Filoviral hemorrhagic fevers are rare but highly lethal diseases associated with outbreaks in developing countries. 1,2 The causative agents, Ebola virus and Marburg virus, are considered to be high level biothreat agents by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. 3 There are no effective vaccines to be used as prophylactics and no effective antiviral interventions to manage the diseases. Because the clinical symptoms of Marburg and Ebola hemorrhagic fevers are difficult to distinguish, a drug that is effective against either would be a first, and one that is effective against both the viruses would be an enormous breakthrough."
,"Background: Patient-centered care (PCC) and integrative care approach are widely advocated. However, their implementation usually requires an extended consultation time. Despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. Methods: We conducted a ""15-Minute Consultation"" for first-time patients in outpatient clinics of 13 departments. A control group was selected from the same physicians' first-time patients, adjusting for age and gender. A total of 275 patients were selected for receiving in-depth consultation and 141 control patients were selected for regular consultation. Data were collected from patients using a questionnaire comprising a patient-centeredness scale and items on potential predictors such as socio-demographic and clinical factors. We also investigated the participating physician's professionalism. Results: As compared to the control group, the in-depth consultation group scored higher on 5 variables associated with PCC, including (patients' perception of ) medical professionals, wait and consultation times, treatment, patient advocacy, and patient satisfaction. While 92.4% of patients in the in-depth consultation group reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of those in the control group reported the same (P < 0.01). In the in-depth consultation group, scores on satisfaction level were the highest for the department of internal medicine, followed by departments of surgery and pediatrics. Participating physicians' improved satisfaction following the intervention proved that in-depth consultation facilitated building a rapport with patients. Conclusion: This study illustrated that the provision of sufficiently long consultation for serious and rare diseases could improve PCC and physicians' professionalism. Health authorities should reshuffle the healthcare delivery system and provide sufficient consultation time to ensure PCC and medical professionalism.","The ""establishment of a healthcare delivery system"" and ""strengthening of national health insurance coverage,"" are unsolved problems of the healthcare system in Korea. According to World Health Organization (WHO), referral hospitals, categorized as tertiary care facilities, are responsible for treatment, education, and research. 1 Additionally, WHO emphasizes the role of referral hospitals in providing highly specialized treatment for rare, serious, and noncurable diseases."
"OncoImmunology e22978-1 OncoImmunology 2:1, e22978","The vacuolar aTpase (V-aTpase) plays an important role in tumor progression and metastases. a novel peptide from the a2 isoform of V-aTpase called a2NTD has been shown to exert an immunoregulatory role in the tumor microenvironment by controlling the maturation of monocytes toward a tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. Our data indicate that a2NTD binds to the surface of monocytes. a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by pro-inflammatory monocytes bearing a cD142 + cD16 + phenotype, which is associated with the monocyte-to-macrophage maturation process. Both a2NTD binding and internalization led to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β by cD142 + cD16 − (classical) and cD142 + cD16 + (intermediate) monocytes. a2NTD was internalized via a macropinocytosis mechanism utilizing scavenger receptors. however, the inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis did not reduce cytokine production by monocytes. This points to the existence of two receptors that respond to a2NTD: scavengers receptors that mediate cellular uptake and an hitherto unidentified receptor stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines.","Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are multi-protein complexes found on the surface of tumor cells. 1,2 V-ATPases impact on tumorigenesis at they acidify the extracellular environment via their proton pumping activity. This enables the maturation of pH-sensitive degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which promote tumor metastasis. 3, 4 Increased cell surface expression of V-ATPases has indeed been linked to tumor cell invasion. 5 Tumor cells secrete cytokines and other proteins that dictate various facets of the immune response that they will generate, including the activation and polarization of specific macrophage and neutrophil subsets. 6, 7 Cytokines such as interferon γ (IFNγ) skew macrophages toward a classically activated phenotype called M1, which participates in tumor destruction. In contrast, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-10 promote the maturation of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. 8, 9 The M2 phenotype promotes tumor survival by favoring proliferation and tumor progression, 10 as well as by stimulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. 11 M2 macrophages promote extracellular matrix remodeling 12 while at the same time regulating a complex chemokine network. 13 Blood monocytes are generally viewed as a heterogeneous population of cells that constitute the precursors to tissue macrophages. Monocytes are differentiated based on the cell surface expression of two markers: the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein CD14 and the Fcγ receptor CD16. In 2010, the nomenclature was modified to include three subtypes of monocytes based on these two markers. Classical monocytes display a CD14 ++ CD16 − phenotype and represent 80-90% of all monocytes. The minor populations consist of CD14 ++ CD16 + (intermediate) and CD14 + CD16 ++ (non-classical) monocytes. 14 Monocytes expressing both CD14 and CD16 show a more mature morphological and functional phenotype than their CD16 − counterparts and are thought to constitute the specific precursors of tissue-resident macrophages. 15 Our studies use this new classification system, however many of the references use the old nomenclature and so will be referred to as originally published."
Comprehensive functional analysis of N-linked glycans on Ebola virus GP1,"Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires the virion surface-associated glycoprotein (GP) that is composed of a trimer of heterodimers (GP1/GP2). The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N-and O-linked glycans. Sitedirected mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca 2؉ -dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency. IMPORTANCE Filovirus outbreaks occur sporadically throughout central Africa, causing high fatality rates among the general public and health care workers. These unpredictable hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are caused by multiple species of Ebola viruses, as well as Marburg virus. While filovirus vaccines and therapeutics are being developed, there are no licensed products. The sole viral envelope glycoprotein, which is a principal immunogenic target, contains a heavy shield of glycans surrounding the conserved receptor-binding domain. We find that disruption of this shield through targeted mutagenesis leads to an increase in cell entry, protease sensitivity, and antiserum/antibody sensitivity but is not sufficient to allow virion binding to the intracellular receptor NPC1. Therefore, our studies provide evidence that filoviruses maintain glycoprotein glycosylation to protect against proteases and antibody neutralization at the expense of efficient entry. Our results unveil interesting insights into the unique entry process of filoviruses and potential immune evasion tactics of the virus.","ing diversification of this region of the protein. In contrast, the glycan cap and MLD have extensive sequence diversity between the different Ebola virus species. As the names suggest, both the glycan cap and the MLD are highly glycosylated, resulting in the majority of the protein being masked by glycans (Fig. 1A) (6) . The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycan sites (NGS) and, despite generally poor sequence conservation within the glycan cap, these sites are well conserved among Ebola viruses, suggesting functional significance (Fig. 1C) . In contrast to the glycan cap, the glycosylation events found in the MLD are highly variable between the different viruses and include both N-and O-linked glycans. Despite extensive glycosylation, the MLD remains highly targeted by neutralizing antibodies (7) (8) (9) ."
European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine An Uncommon Cause of Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum and Subcutaneous Emphysema,"A 79-year-old gentleman presented with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with pneumonia but no preexisting lung disease. He presented with a 4-day history of increased shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fevers, and non-productive cough. After 4 days of intravenous antibiotics, the patient developed considerable subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum presents most commonly with chest pain, shortness of breath, and subcutaneous emphysema. It has previously been associated with cases of pneumonia but often with rare strains such as P. jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. This case highlights spontaneous pneumomediastinum as a rare complication of pneumonia. Treatment of pneumomediastinum is typically conservative, and although options may be limited, aggressive management of any causative factor may be essential in selected cases.",Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is caused by elevated intra-alveolar pressures that trigger alveolar rupture which often leads to subcutaneous emphysema [1] . A case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in a 79-year-old gentleman with pneumonia but no pre-existing lung disease is presented. This case highlights spontaneous pneumomediastinum as a rare complication of pneumonia.
Specific Asparagine-linked Oligosaccharides Are Not Required for Certain Neuron-Neuron and Neuron-Schwann Cell Interactions,"To determine whether specific asparaginelinked (N-linked) oligosaccharides present in cell surface glycoproteins are required for cell-cell interactions within the peripheral nervous system, we have used castanospermine to inhibit maturation of N-linked sugars in cell cultures of neurons or neurons plus Schwann cells. Maximally 10-15 % of the N-linked oligosaccharides on neuronal proteins have normal structure when cells are cultured in the presence of 250 lxg/ml castanospermine; the remaining oligosaccharides are present as immature carbohydrate chains not normally found in these glycoproteins. Although cultures were treated for 2 wk with castanospermine, cells always remained viable and appeared healthy. We have analyzed several biological responses of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons, with or without","added purified populations of Schwann cells, in the presence of castanospermine. We have observed that a normal complement of mature, N-linked sugars are not required for neurite outgrowth, neuron-Schwann cell adhesion, neuron-induced Schwann cell proliferation, or ensheathment of neurites by Schwann cells. Treatment of neuronal cultures with castanospermine increases the propensity of neurites to fasciculate. Ex-traceUular matrix deposition by Schwarm cells and myelination of neurons by Schwann cells are greatly diminished in the presence of castanospermine as assayed by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, suggesting that specific N-linked oligosaccharides are required for the expression of these cellular functions."
Autocrine Interferon Priming in Macrophages but Not Dendritic Cells Results in Enhanced Cytokine and Chemokine Production after Coronavirus Infection,"To begin to understand why IFN is produced in infected macrophages, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and as a control, bone marrowderived DC (BMDC) with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-␣/␤) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.","associated proteins, and one to eight accessory proteins (proteins interspersed between or within structural proteins encoded at the 3= end of the genome). SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) accessory proteins ORF3b and ORF6, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) accessory protein ORF5a, MHV and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) proteins and replicase-associated nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and nsp3 are all able to inhibit IFN induction and/or signaling (9-15) (reviewed in reference 16) . In addition, MHV delays IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction by IFN or Sendai virus (SenV) (17) . Further, in some cell types, including fibroblasts and cDC, neither SARS-CoV nor MHV induces IFN expression. However, neither virus is able to prevent IFN induction by other viruses or by poly(I · C), which suggests that these viruses are ""invisible"" to intracellular IFN sensors (18, 19) . This ""passive"" method of immune evasion may occur because coronaviruses replicate on membranous structures, including double-membrane vesicles, thereby limiting exposure of sequestered RNA to innate immune sensors (18) (19) (20) . On first glance, these results appeared to contradict the observation that type I IFNs are detected in MHV-infected mice and in patients with SARS (21, 22) . However, IFN is induced in pDC by a TLR7-and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent pathway, in macrophages and microglia in an MDA5-dependent pathway, and in oligodendrocyte cell lines via MDA5-and RIG-I-dependent pathways (23) (24) (25) . Collectively, these results show that coronaviruses use multiple approaches to evade the innate immune response and that the extent and nature of evasion are cell type dependent. The basis of these cell type-specific differences in IFN expression after coronavirus infection is not well understood."
Deep sequencing analysis of viral infection and evolution allows rapid and detailed characterization of viral mutant spectrum,"The study of RNA virus populations is a challenging task. Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies. Availability and implementation: Freely available on the web at http://www.vivanbioinfo.org Contact: nshomron@post.tau.ac.il Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","The study of RNA virus populations is a challenging task. Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies (Lauring and Andino, 2010) . This genotypic diversity is the result of the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which surpasses that of DNA organisms by orders of magnitude (Sanjuán et al., 2010) . This intrinsic high error-rate is largely attributed to the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases that replicate their genomes (Steinhauer and Holland, 1987) . Recent studies demonstrate that this high-error rate is essential for viral adaptation and survival (Ahlquist, 2002; Crotty et al., 2001) and can have significant implications in vaccine and antiviral efficacy (Love et al., 2010; Woo and Reifman, 2012) . Changes in the rate at which these errors occur may affect virus infectivity, fitness and pathogenesis Crotty and Andino, 2002; Gnä dig et al., 2012; Graham et al., 2012) . Moreover, it was shown that the diversity within an RNA virus population enhances tissue tropism and dissemination, possibly by improving adaptability and mutual support (Vignuzzi et al., 2005) . These studies suggest that characterizing RNA virus populations as a whole, rather than focusing on dominant viral haplotypes (e.g. sequences shared by a significant amount of members in the population) or consensus sequence is far more informative to study pathogenesis. Currently, RNA viruses are genetically characterized through a variety of techniques. The most basic and common method involves classic Sanger sequencing of cDNA produced by RT-PCR of total viral RNA (i.e. consensus sequencing). Although informative, the consensus sequence is the genetic average of all variants within the virus population and the limitations of this method include its low resolution and ability to detect only highly abundant variants. To increase sensitivity and obtain a small, representative sample of viral variants in a given population by Sanger sequencing, individual viruses can be isolated and amplified (biological clones) (Vignuzzi et al., 2005) or RT-PCR amplicons of the whole population can be subcloned into individual plasmids (molecular clones) (Levi et al., 2010; Sanjuán et al., 2010) . An additional method is Single Genome Amplification in which viral RNA is extracted from a sample and copied into cDNA, which in turn is subjected to limiting dilution and PCR amplification. Thus the obtained PCR products are the result of the amplification of one single molecule of cDNA. These PCR products are then sequenced directly without cloning. Nevertheless, these three methods are time intensive and tedious. Furthermore, the limited coverage that can be sampled (generally <100 clones and 100 K nucleotides per population) is far from the range of variants (105-109) typically found in virus samples. Newer high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have expedited research in microbiology in general, including virology, due to their high throughput sequence data production (Capobianchi et al., 2013; Didelot et al., 2012; Radford et al., 2012; Shomron, 2013) . The ultra-deep coverage afforded by HTS technologies provides obvious improvements to the characterization of RNA viruses. However, most HTS tools in virology are designed for virus discovery, de novo assembly of unknown viral genomes, and the characterization of viral biodiversity found in different organs, organisms or environments (virome) (Delwart, 2013; Foulongne et al., 2012; Hurwitz and Sullivan, 2013; Roux et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2012) . More recently, researchers have begun characterizing the intra-host and intra-strain virus diversity and population dynamics for a variety of viruses of clinical or agricultural relevance. For example, some studies addressed the temporal evolution of variants, the pre-existing presence of drug resistant mutants and the dynamics and emergence of escape mutations in the presence of various types of pressure (Archer et al., 2012b; Barzon et al., 2011; Beerenwinkel and Zagordi, 2011; Bull et al., 2011; Escobar-Gutiérrez et al., 2012; Grad et al., 2014; Love et al., 2010; Martínez et al., 2012; Selleri et al., 2012; Tö pfer et al., 2013; Willerth et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2011) . However, virologists using HTS technologies for the purpose of rare variant detection, face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies (Archer et al., 2012a; Watson et al., 2013; Wright et al., 2011) . In order to overcome these hurdles several methods have been proposed (Acevedo et al., 2013; Eriksson et al., 2008; Flaherty et al., 2012; Ghedin et al., 2012; Jabara et al., 2011; Kinde et al., 2011; Macalalad et al., 2012; Mangul et al., 2014; Schmitt et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2013; Wilm et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014; Zagordi et al., 2011) . These methods can be split into two main categories. The first increases variant detection fidelity by modulating the library preparation step. Schmitt et al. tag and compare both strands of a DNA segment, efficiently pinpointing strand-discordant variants as errors. Jabara et al., Kinde et al., Mangul et al. and Wu et al. use Macalalad et al. used covariation (i.e. phasing) between variants and an expectation maximization-based quality recalibration. Methods which aim to identify the genomes of individual haplotypes in the population (Eriksson et al., 2008; Zagordi et al., 2011) utilize clustering of overlapping reads and haplotype reconstruction in order to correct for sequencing errors. The performance of these methods depends upon the length of sequence reads with long reads enabling the reconstruction of entire viral genome sequences. Some methods (Ghedin et al., 2012; McElroy et al., 2013; Wilm et al., 2012) also include an additional test for strand bias (Guo et al., 2012) in order to further reduce false positive calls. Although these second category methods demonstrate very high specificity (positions without variance are correctly identified as such), sensitivity (pinpointing true variant positions) remains the major limiting factor (Wilm et al., 2012) . All of the aforementioned tools focus on accurate variant detection and do not facilitate any downstream analysis and interpretation of the detected variants. Moreover, although the end-users for the aforementioned tools and methods are, for the most part, virologists studying highly diverse viral populations, these tools require the use of unix command line and other computational proficiencies which are not common in the field."

"Veterinary Science pISSN 1229-845X, eISSN 1976-555X","containing 36 ppm germanium. The present study was conducted to better understand the effects of GB on immune responses in a mouse model, and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases. In the mouse model, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. In pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV, viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the GB-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection. Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that GB-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group, indicating that GB promotes PRRSV clearance. These antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of GB to increase CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte production observed in the mice. Hence, this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, emerged in the late 1980s in the United States and Europe [24] . It quickly spread worldwide and became enzootic among pig populations in most countries [24] . The virus strongly modulates host immune responses and changes host gene expression patterns. PRRSV inhibits the production of key cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-α [2, 3] , and may induce the expression of regulatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-10 [20] . Moreover, the appearance of neutralizing antibodies is delayed in pigs infected with PRRSV [4, 16, 23] and these animals are more prone to develop concomitant infectious diseases [10, 19] . Data from these and other studies indicate that PRRSV causes immunosuppression in the affected pigs [5, 15] . Therefore, strengthening the host defense mechanisms may be important for controlling PRRSV infection. Germanium biotite (GB) is an aluminosilicate mineral that contains 36 ppm germanium. This compound possesses a number of biological activities that are beneficial for animal health, especially immune function and host defense. A previous study reported that GB enhances the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in mouse spleen lymphocyte [11] . Continuous ingestion of the mineral also increases phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced cytokine expression and enhances antibody production in mice in a dose-dependent manner [9] . Moreover, dietary supplementation with GB expedites the clearance of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in experimentally infected pigs [9] as well as bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1) clearance from experimentally infected calves [12] . These findings suggest that GB as a feed supplement can potentially protect against respiratory viral diseases through the potent stimulation of non-specific immune responses. However, the underlying immunological mechanisms remain unclear and anti-PRRSV effects of the mineral have not yet been examined."
"Localization of a Yeast Early Golgi Mannosyltransferase, Ochlp, Involves Retrograde Transport","To analyze the mechanism of integral membrane protein localization in the early Golgi apparatus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have used Ochlp, a cis-","Golgi mannosyltransferase. A series of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged fusion proteins was constructed in which invertase is appended to the Golgi-luminal carboxy terminus of full-length Oehlp. Several constructs included a Kex2p cleavage site between the Ochlp and invertase moieties to monitor transit to the Kex2p-containing TGN. Cells expressing an Ochlp-invertase fusion do not secrete invertase, but those expressing an Ochlp-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein secrete high levels of invertase in a Kex2pdependent manner. The Ochlp-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein is cleaved with a half-time of 5 min, and the process proceeds to completion. Before cleavage the protein receives glycosyl modifications indicative of passage through the medialand trans-Golgi, therefore cleavage occurs after ordered anterograde transport through the Golgi to the TGN. Transit to distal compartments is not induced by the invertase moiety, since noninvertase fusion constructs encounter the same glycosyltransferases and Kex2p as well. The Ochlp-HA moiety, irrespective of whether it is generated by cleavage of the fusion protein in the TGN or synthesized de novo, is degraded with a half-time of about 60 min. Thus, the half-time of degradation is 12-fold longer than the time required to reach the TGN. At steady state, de novo--synthesized and TGN-generated HA epitope-tagged Ochlp reside in a compartment with a buoyant density identical to that of wild-type Ochlp and distinct from that of the vacuole or the TGN. Finally, ochl null cells that express an Ochlp fusion construct known to rapidly encounter the TGN glycosylate invertase to the same extent as wild-type cells, indicating that they have phenotypically wild-type Ochlp activity. These results lead us to propose a model for Ochlp-HA localization that involves movement to distal compartments, at least as far as the TGN, followed by retrieval to the cis compartment, presumably by vesicular transport."
"Dual role of chloroquine in liver ischemia reperfusion injury: reduction of liver damage in early phase, but aggravation in late phase","The anti-malaria drug chloroquine is well known as autophagy inhibitor. Chloroquine has also been used as anti-inflammatory drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a dual effect in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury: chloroquine on the one hand could protect the liver against I/R injury via inhibition of inflammatory response, but on the other hand could aggravate liver I/R injury through inhibition of autophagy. Rats (n ¼ 6 per group) were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. At the early phase (i.e., 0-6 h after reperfusion), chloroquine treatment ameliorated liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines and fewer histopathologic changes. In contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury at the late phase of reperfusion (i.e., 24-48 h after reperfusion). The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine appeared to involve its ability to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1 release and inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver injury via inhibition of autophagy and induction of hepatic apoptosis at the late phase.","Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs during the procedure of liver transplantation, liver resection, trauma and other surgical procedures when the liver is transiently deprived of oxygen and subsequently re-oxygenated. 1, 2 Injury to the liver caused by I/R has been shown be associated with increased rate of acute liver failure/graft rejection and chronic liver dysfunction after liver transplantation."
Mucosal Delivery of ACNPV Baculovirus Driving Expression of the Gal-Lectin LC3 Fragment Confers Protection against Amoebic Liver Abscess in Hamster,"Mucosal vaccination against amoebiasis using the Gal-lectin of E. histolytica has been proposed as one of the leading strategies for controlling this human disease. However, most mucosal adjuvants used are toxic and the identification of safe delivery systems is necessary. Here, we evaluate the potential of a recombinant Autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the LC3 fragment of the Gal-lectin to confer protection against amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in hamsters following oral or nasal immunization. Hamsters immunized by oral route showed complete absence (57.9%) or partial development (21%) of ALA, resulting in some protection in 78.9% of animals when compared with the wild type baculovirus and sham control groups. In contrast, nasal immunization conferred only 21% of protection efficacy. Levels of ALA protection showed lineal correlation with the development of an anti-amoebic cellular immune response evaluated in spleens, but not with the induction of seric IgG anti-amoeba antibodies. These results suggest that baculovirus driving the expression of E. histolytica vaccine candidate antigens is useful for inducing protective cellular and humoral immune responses following oral immunization, and therefore it could be used as a system for mucosal delivery of an anti-amoebic vaccine.","Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite which causes dysentery and amoebic liver abscess (ALA) disease in humans. It is responsible for 40, 000 to 100, 000 deaths annually, ranking it as the second highest cause of mortality attributed to a protozoan parasitic disease (1) . In Mexico, amoebiasis is ranked as the sixth highest cause of morbidity (2) , with the last national seroepidemiological survey showing a seroprevalence rate of 8.4% in general population using an indirect hemagglutination test (3) . Amoebiasis is most frequent in developing countries where environmental and population hygiene measures can be deficient. Although pharmacological treatment with metronidazole is effective, the still widespread prevalence of the disease as well as the side effects associated with the drug positions vaccination against amoebiasis an attractive alternative (4) . Ideally, an anti-amoebic vaccine should confer protection against Ivyspring International Publisher mucosal colonization by the trophozoites, avoiding intestinal amoebic dysentery, and consequently, the extraintestinal ALA disease (5) ."
An Ion-transporting ATPase Encodes Multiple Apical Localization Signals,Epithelial cells accumulate distinct popula-,"T rIn plasma membranes of polarized epithelial cells are divided into apical and basolateral domains whose markedly different biochemical compositions reflect their distinct functional roles (Caplan and Matlin, 1989; Rodriguez-Boulan and Nelson, 1989) . To generate and maintain these domains, cells must be capable of distinguishing among newly synthesized membrane proteins and of ensuring that they are concentrated at their sites of ultimate functional residence. In many cases, this sorting process appears to occur during the course of a protein's initial transit through the organelles of the biosynthetic processing pathway, before its first appearance at the plasma membrane Matlin and Simons, 1984; Misek et al., 1984; Pfeiffer et al., 1985) . Evidence from other systems indicates that sorting can involve selective stabilization at a plasmalemmal domain, subsequent to a protein's random delivery to both cell surfaces (Hammerton et al., 1991) . Whether sorting takes place at the level of the Golgi or at the plasmalemma, this process must make use of sorting information, or sorting signals embedded within the structure of the sorted protein itself. These signals are interpreted by the cellular sorting machinery and thus serve to dictate each polypeptide's ultimate subcellular distribution."
Prevalence and Seasonal Distribution of Respiratory Viruses During the 2014 -2015 Season in Istanbul,"Background: Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is one of the most common infections worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality.","Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children and adults worldwide. The mortality rate is higher in children under five years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (1, 2) . The most common causative agents of ARTIs are viruses. Influenza A virus (IFV-A), influenza B virus (IFV-B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus (AdV), and rhinovirus (RV) are the most frequently reported viruses associated with ARTIs in the general population. However, their distribution varies by season, geographic region, and age group (3, 4) ."
Infectious Diseases -Original Article Is Fever a Red Flag for Bacterial Pneumonia in Children With Viral Bronchiolitis?,"We hypothesized that fever in children with viral bronchiolitis indicates the need for consideration of superimposed bacterial pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective study of 349 children aged 2 years and younger with diagnoses of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and viral upper respiratory infection. Data were analyzed using Pearson χ 2 test. One hundred seventy-eight children had RSV with no other identified virus. The majority of children (56%) who had only RSV were afebrile. Febrile children with RSV were over twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia as those who were afebrile (60% vs 27%, P < .001). In the 171 children who had bronchiolitis caused by a virus other than RSV, 51% were afebrile. These children were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than those who were afebrile (65% vs 8%, P < .001). Evaluation of febrile children with viral bronchiolitis may allow early diagnosis and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia.",Several previous studies have revealed potential morbidity from bacterial pneumonia in patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV infection may increase the risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. 1 RSV increases the virulence of streptococcal pneumonia by binding to penicillin-binding protein 1a. Coinfection with RSV and Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia. 2 Physicians must be mindful of the potential for secondary bacterial pneumonia in viral bronchiolitis so that it can be promptly treated.
,"We developed a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit for detecting IgG/IgM antibodies against Zika virus (ZIKV) using monoclonal antibodies to the envelope (E) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of ZIKV. These proteins were produced using baculovirus expression vector with Sf9 cells. Monoclonal antibodies J2G7 to NS1 and J5E1 to E protein were selected and conjugated with colloidal gold to produce the Zika IgG/IgM RDT kit (Zika RDT). Comparisons with ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and PCR were done to investigate the analytical sensitivity of Zika RDT, which resulted in 100% identical results. Sensitivity and specificity of Zika RDT in a field test was determined using positive and negative samples from Brazil and Korea. The diagnostic accuracy of Zika RDT was fairly high; sensitivity and specificity for IgG was 99.0 and 99.3%, respectively, while for IgM it was 96.7 and 98.7%, respectively. Cross reaction with dengue virus was evaluated using anti-Dengue Mixed Titer Performance Panel (PVD201), in which the Zika RDT showed crossreactions with DENV in 16.7% and 5.6% in IgG and IgM, respectively. Cross reactions were not observed with West Nile, yellow fever, and hepatitis C virus infected sera. Zika RDT kit is very simple to use, rapid to assay, and very sensitive, and highly specific. Therefore, it would serve as a choice of method for point-of-care diagnosis and large scale surveys of ZIKV infection under clinical or field conditions worldwide in endemic areas.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne, single stranded RNA flavivirus that was first identified in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 from Rhesus monkeys [1] . Some cases of human infection were reported in Africa and Asia [2, 3] before the first major outbreak on the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007 [4] . ZIKV spread to the American continent [5] , and its emergence was associated with the description of severe neurological complications; Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in adults in French Polynesia and microcephaly in neonates in Brazil [6, 7] ."
Identification of a Natural Viral RNA Motif That Optimizes Sensing of Viral RNA by RIG-I,"Stimulation of the antiviral response depends on the sensing of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specialized cellular proteins. During infection with RNA viruses, 5=-di-or -triphosphates accompanying specific single or double-stranded RNA motifs trigger signaling of intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and initiate the antiviral response. Although these molecular signatures are present during the replication of many viruses, it is unknown whether they are sufficient for strong activation of RLRs during infection. Immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (iDVGs) from Sendai virus (SeV) are among the most potent natural viral triggers of antiviral immunity. Here we describe an RNA motif (DVG 70-114 ) that is essential for the potent immunostimulatory activity of 5=-triphosphate-containing SeV iDVGs. DVG 70-114 enhances viral sensing by the host cell independently of the long stretches of complementary RNA flanking the iDVGs, and it retains its stimulatory potential when transferred to otherwise inert viral RNA. In vitro analysis showed that DVG 70-114 augments the binding of RIG-I to viral RNA and promotes enhanced RIG-I polymerization, thereby facilitating the onset of the antiviral response. Together, our results define a new natural viral PAMP enhancer motif that promotes viral recognition by RLRs and confers potent immunostimulatory activity to viral RNA. IMPORTANCE A discrete group of molecular motifs, including 5=-triphosphates associated with double-stranded RNA, have been identified as essential for the triggering of antiviral immunity. Most RNA viruses expose these motifs during their replication; however, successful viruses normally evade immune recognition and replicate to high levels before detection, indicating that unknown factors drive antiviral immunity. DVGs from SeV are among the most potent natural viral stimuli of the antiviral response known to date. These studies define a new natural viral motif present in DVGs that maximizes viral recognition by the intracellular sensor RIG-I, allowing fast and strong antiviral responses even in the presence of viral-encoded immune antagonists. This motif can be harnessed to increase the immunostimulatory potential of otherwise inert viral RNAs and represents a novel immunostimulatory enhancer that could be used in the development of vaccine adjuvants and antivirals.

The delay in the detection of viral structures that are normally present in the viral genomes during natural infections indicates that additional factors are required for the effective triggering of antiviral responses in vivo. During infection with SeV, a potent stimulus for the initiation of the antiviral response is provided by immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (iDVGs) generated during virus replication at high titers (23) (24) (25) . SeV iDVGs trigger RLR signaling and initiate strong antiviral immunity both in vitro and during natural infections in vivo (24, 26) . SeV iDVGs belong to the copy-back type of RNA DVGs and are produced when the viral polymerase is released from the template strand during replication and copies back the nascent strand (27) . iDVGs are unable to replicate in the absence of a helper virus, as they lack the essential replication machinery and they are not transcribed into proteins due to their flanking antigenomic promoter (28) (29) (30) (31) . A copy-back iDVG of 546 nt (DVG-546) predominant in laboratory stocks of SeV strain Cantell (SeV C) is among the strongest natural triggers of RLR signaling (12, 23, 26, 32) . Although this activity largely depends on 5=-triphosphates and the presence of dsRNA structures, it is unclear whether additional RNA motifs optimize the immunostimulatory potential of DVG-546, contributing to its efficient recognition even in the presence of virusencoded antagonists of the antiviral response (25, 33) ."
,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of patient compliance with supportive periodontal treatment (PC-SPT). Chronic periodontitis patients were classified based on their compliance level, and factors affecting PC-SPT and the prognosis of PC-SPT were investigated. Methods: This study selected 206 patients who started SPT after receiving periodontal treatment between 2010 and 2012. Patients who continued SPT through February 2016 were included. The patients were classified according to whether they exhibited complete compliance (100% of visits), excellent compliance (≥70% of visits), incomplete compliance (<70% of visits), or non-compliance (only 2 visits). Patient characteristics that could affect PC-SPT, such as age, sex, distance of the clinic from their residence, implantation, and periodontal treatment, were investigated. The number of newly decayed and extracted teeth, alveolar bone level changes around the teeth and implants, and implant removal were examined to evaluate the prognosis of PC-SPT. Results: Sex and the presence of an implant significantly affected PC-SPT. Additionally, the number of newly decayed and extracted teeth and changes in alveolar bone levels around the teeth and implants were significant prognostic factors related to PC-SPT. Conclusions: PC-SPT in chronic periodontitis patients will help maintain periodontal health and prevent further periodontal disease.","Chronic periodontitis is a disease of the oral cavity characterized by inflammation that spreads from the gingiva into the periodontal tissue, resulting in periodontal pocket formation, destruction and absorption of alveolar bone, loss of the attached gingiva, gingival recession, and increased tooth mobility [1] . It is easily neglected in the gingivitis stage or during early periodontitis because very few subjective symptoms are present. Thus, treatment usually begins after progression to a later stage, which is more difficult to cure due to the development of alveolar bone destruction [2] . As with most chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, constant maintenance and management are required."
Analysis of seasonal tendencies in pediatric Henoch-Schönlein purpura and comparison with outbreak of infectious diseases,Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is one of the most common vasculitis in children. This study was aimed at identifying seasonal trends and epidemiologic features of pediatric HSP patients through public data to analyze the correlation of HSP and prevalence of a specific respiratory or enteric virus.,"Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) occurs across all races worldwide and is one of the most common forms of vasculitis in children with 10 to 30 cases reported per 100,000 children under 17 years of age. [1, 2] Ninety percent of the cases occur in children <10 years of age, with the average age between 4 and 6 years. [2] HSP in adults is rare than in children but often progresses to a serious condition leading to chronic complications. Its annual incidence is estimated to be 15 cases/100,000 per year in children compared with 1.3 cases/100,000 per year in adults. Skin symptoms occur mainly in the lower extremities or hips, but they can also involve the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. In acute cases, severe abdominal pain, arthralgia, or proteinuria may develop. [3] [4] [5] Complications such as intussusception, perforation, and renal failure may also occur, and an accurate diagnosis is needed at the onset of the disease. [6] Therefore, it is important to determine the timing of an HSP epidemic and identify its causative agents."
,"Paediatric Virology is a bold new scientific field, which combines Paediatrics with Virology, Epidemiology, Molecular Medicine, Evidence-based Medicine, Clinical Governance, Quality Improvement, Pharmacology and Immunology. The Workshop on Paediatric Virology, which took place on Saturday October 10, 2015 in Athens, Greece, provided an overview of recent views and advances on viral infections occurring in neonates and children. It was included in the official programme of the 20th World Congress on Advances in Oncology and the 18th International Symposium on Molecular Medicine, which attracted over 500 delegates from the five continents. During the Workshop, the topics covered included the challenges of vaccine implementation against human papillomaviruses in countries under financial crisis, strategies for eradicating poliomyelitis and its 60th vaccine anniversary, as well as the debate on the association between autism and vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella. Among the non-vaccine related topics, emphasis was given to viral infections in prematurely born infants and their long-term outcomes, new paediatric intensive care management options for bronchiolitis related to respiratory syncytial virus, the clinical implications of hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus genotyping, the Ebola virus threat and preparedness in Paediatric Emergency Departments, oral, oropharynx, laryngeal, nasal and ocular viral infections and Merkel cell polyomavirus as a novel emerging virus of infancy and childhood. In this review, we provide selected presentations and reports discussed at the Workshop.","The history of paediatric infectious diseases closely parallels the history of Paediatrics, as infections remain the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality (1, 2) . Viral paediatric infectious diseases are characterised by a great heterogeneity of clinical manifestations due to the unique characteristics of the neonatal period and childhood. Almost 50 years ago, Paediatric Virology was not considered an isolated discipline and was included in the paediatric infectious diseases section of the scientific field of Paediatrics (3) . However, during the past two decades, new advances in the field of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine have expanded the level of knowledge on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral infections occurring in infancy and childhood. For this reason, although additional subspecialists in several fields may be diminishing (4) , Paediatric Virology as a bold new scientific field can combine Paediatrics with Virology, Epidemiology, Molecular Medicine, Evidence-based Medicine, Clinical Governance, Quality Improvement, Pharmacology and Immunology (Fig. 1) ."

Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.","As of Feb 5, 2020, more than 24 550 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been confirmed, including more than 190 cases outside of China, and more than 490 reported deaths globally. 1 Control measures have been implemented within China to try to contain the outbreak. 2 As people with the infection arrive in countries or areas without ongoing transmission, efforts are being made to halt transmission, and prevent potential outbreaks. 3, 4 Isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and identification of contacts are a crucial part of these control efforts; however, whether these efforts will achieve control of transmission of COVID-19 is unclear."
Adverse effects of isolation in hospitalised patients: a systematic review,"Objective To systematically review the literature exploring impact of isolation on hospitalised patients who are infectious: psychological and non-psychological outcomes Design Systematic review with quantification Data Sources Embase, Medline and Psychinfo were searched from inception until December 2018.","The review indicates that isolation to contain risk of infection has negative consequences for segregated patients. Although strength of the evidence is weak, comprising primarily single centre convenience samples, consistency of the effects may strengthen this conclusion. More research needs to be undertaken to examine this relationship and develop and test interventions to reduce the negative effects of isolation."
"INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and Financing","Physicians play multiple roles in a health system. They typically serve simultaneously as the agent for patients, for insurers, for their own medical practices, and for the hospital facilities where they practice. Theoretical and empirical results have demonstrated that financial relations among these different stakeholders can affect clinical outcomes as well as the efficiency and quality of care. What are the physicians' roles as the agents of Chinese patients? The marketization approach of China's economic reforms since 1978 has made hospitals and physicians profit-driven. Such profit-driven behavior and the financial tie between hospitals and physicians have in turn made physicians more the agents of hospitals rather than of their patients. While this commentary acknowledges physicians' ethics and their dedication to their patients, it argues that the current physician agency relation in China has created barriers to achieving some of the central goals of current provider-side health care reform efforts. In addition to eliminating existing perverse financial incentives for both hospitals and physicians, the need for which is already agreed upon by numerous scholars, we argue that the success of the ongoing Chinese public hospital reform and of overall health care reform also relies on establishing appropriate physician-hospital agency relations. This commentary proposes 2 essential steps to establish such physician-hospital agency relations: (1) minimize financial ties between senior physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals by establishing a separate reimbursement system for senior physicians, and (2) establishing a comprehensive physician professionalism system underwritten by the Chinese government, professional physician associations, and major health care facilities as well as by physician leadership representatives. Neither of these suggestions is addressed adequately in current health care reform activities.","Chinese health system development and economic reforms in the past 70 years have nurtured the current unique physician agency relations in China. Between 1949 and 1978, the Chinese health care system was designed with the objective to provide ""equal access for all regardless of ability to pay,"" an ideology championed by the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong. 1 To achieve this goal, the Chinese government INQUIRY assumed control of all aspects of health care and delivery-it provided funding for the construction of hospitals and clinics, paid health workers a fixed salary, and set the prices for medicines and services. 2 At that time, all physicians became employees of public hospitals, establishing the foundation of the current dominating role of public hospitals, especially tertiary-level public hospitals in China. 3 While the post-1978 economic reforms and the marketoriented approach have helped develop the Chinese health care system (eg, the number of hospitals in China has increased from 9902 to 20 918 between 1980 and 2010), 4 new challenges have also emerged. First, governmental subsidies to public health care facilities declined dramatically after 1978. The government's subsidies to public hospitals fell to merely 10% of their total expenditures by the 1990s, 5 and 90% or more of Chinese public hospitals' revenue continued to depend on drug sales and services in 2010. 6 While Chinese public hospitals continued to have a bureaucratic and complex government-run regulation and management system, 3 they also were expected to behave like for-profit entities to earn profit to survive and to continue being competitive in the health care market. 7 Second, because laborrelated medical services remained underpriced, 8 the Chinese government set a higher margin rate for high-technology procedures and diagnostic tests, and hospitals are allowed to charge a 15% to 25% mark-up on drug sales (15% for Western medicine and 25% for Traditional Chinese Medicine). 9 Such policies provided financial incentives for hospitals to begin a ""medical arms race"" to scale up their provision of high-technology diagnostics and interventions, as well as to overprescribe drugs. [10] [11] [12] Third, most of senior physicians' income from hospitals is still a combination of basic salary and bonus, 13 with the bonus coming from hospitals' financial profit. 14 To increase their hospital's profit, hospital management tied the physicians' bonus to their contribution to hospital profits, which has intensified the overprescription of drugs and overuse of diagnostic tests. 5, 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [15] [16] [17] Such an extrinsic bonus incentive method may also ""crowd-out"" physicians' intrinsic concerns for other important aspects of health care, for example, the health care quality and population health. 18 Some scholars have commented that these financial incentives even may have directly eroded physicians' ethics. 17, 19 Because of this strong alignment of financial incentives, senior physicians in effect can become more the agents for public hospitals rather than for their patients."
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy in osteonecrosis of femoral head A systematic review of now available clinical evidences,"Background: Osteonecrosis is an incapacitating disorder with high morbidity. Though extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) provides a noninvasive treatment option, controversial subjects still exist about its effectiveness, indications, and mechanism of action.","As is well-known, osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating disorder with a considerably high incidence in the young and middle-aged (from the 20s to age 50), and consequently brings huge economic burden around the world. [1, 2] Approximately 20,000 patients were estimated to develop ONFH in America every year and another survey showed that the annul morbidity of ONFH in Japan was about 2.51/10,000. [3, 4] It is histologically characterized by insufficient supply of blood, death of osteocytes and bone marrow cells, and progressive structure damage of involved bones. Although osteonecrosis only affects the femoral head in most cases, osteonecrosis of other sites, for example, joints of knee, shoulder, wrist, elbow, and ankle also could be seen on clinic. The etiology of osteonecrosis is of various risk factors such as trauma, surgery of hip, corticosteroids, alcoholism, systemic lupus erythematosus, sickle-cell disease, and coagulopathy; [5] however, usually osteonecrotic lesions possess similar pathophysiological alteration."
Elucidation of Bacterial Pneumonia-Causing Pathogens in Patients with Respiratory Viral Infection Pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia,"Background: Bacterial pneumonia occurring after respiratory viral infection is common. However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to know whether the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of respiratory virus. Methods: Study subjects were 5,298 patients, who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, among who visited the emergency department or outpatient clinic with respiratory symptoms at Ulsan University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: A total of 251 clinically significant bacteria were identified in 233 patients with post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged <16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630). In patients aged ≥16 years, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type. The major results were as follows (p<0.001): pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections was caused by similar bacteria, and the findings indicated that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was very common in these patients. In contrast, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections were associated with pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria. Conclusion: The pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of preceding respiratory virus. This information could help in selecting empirical antibiotics in patients with post-viral pneumonia.","Respiratory viral infection is a significant etiology for community-acquired pneumonia [1] [2] [3] . With the development of detection techniques, respiratory viruses have been detected in 10%-30% patients with community-acquired pneumonia 4, 5 . Respiratory virus infections are also a frequent cause of bacterial pneumonia. In a systematic review of previous studies, the proportion of bacterial pneumonia in patients with influenza was found to range between 11% and 35% 6 ."
Successful treatment of feline leishmaniosis using a combination of allopurinol and N-methyl- glucamine antimoniate,"Case summary This work describes the diagnosis and successful treatment of a 2-year-old domestic cat infected with Leishmania species and presenting fever, and ulcerative and nodular skin lesions after being treated for pyodermatitis for 1 year without clinical improvement. After anamnesis the cat was submitted to a complete clinical examination. Blood was collected for determination of haematological and biochemical parameters, detection of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Leishmania amastigotes. Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the skin nodules was also performed. After definitive diagnosis the animal was treated and followed up over a 2 year period. The animal tested negative for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigen and feline coronavirus RNA. Leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. Thus, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate was added and administered for 30 days, with complete closure of the ulcerative lesions in the hindlimbs requiring a surgical approach. Close monitoring of the patient in the following 24 months indicated that combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses or side effects. Relevance and novel information Considering the increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases and the inconsistent results of most therapeutic protocols described in the literature, the use of new approaches, especially in refractory cases, is essential. Although the use of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate is off-label in cats, in this case the combination treatment was followed by an extensive analytical monitoring, supporting their safety and effectiveness.","The occurrence of feline leishmaniosis (FeL) has increased worldwide, revealing a possible role of cats in leishmaniosis epidemiology. Better accuracy of laboratory techniques has improved the diagnosis of this disease, and changes in ecosystems over the last few years associated with the use of repellents on dogs might play a role in sandflies' altered feeding patterns in urban areas, leading to infections in other mammalian hosts. [1] [2] [3] Worldwide epidemiological surveys of Leishmania species causing feline asymptomatic infection and FeL have been reported. 4, 5 In Europe, Spain had the first described FeL case in 1932. 6 Some authors claim that low prevalence of FeL in endemic areas may be related to a natural resistance to the parasite in cats. 7 Moreover, the number of clinical cases may be underestimated, leading to few reports and lack of information by clinicians and owners. Although Portugal is an endemic country for canine leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum, there are few published clinical reports of FeL, with the first description of it in 1994 in Sesimbra, followed by others in Porto and Lisbon. [8] [9] [10] Despite occasional reports of ocular and visceral disease, dermatological, mucocutaneous/mucosal presentations and lymph node enlargement are the most frequent clinical features. [11] [12] [13] [14] Clinical suspicion is based on history, clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed with parasitological and serological methods. 15 A long-term administration of allopurinol (10-20 mg/kg q12h or q24h) is the most recommended treatment protocol for FeL, 10, 11, 15 however, similarly to dogs, recurrence can occur if the infection is not cleared. Some authors have reported a good clinical response using N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate monotherapy (5-100 mg/kg or 375 mg/cat q24h SC or IM under different protocols). 8, 15 This study aims to describe the treatment of a recurring clinical case of FeL in a cat receiving combined therapy (allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate)."
Challenges in the analysis of viral metagenomes,These authors contributed equally to this work.,"In the last decade, at least seven separate viral outbreaks have caused tens of thousands of human deaths (Woolhouse, Rambaut, and Kellam, 2015) , and the ever-increasing density of livestock, rate of habitat destruction, and extent of human global travel provides a fertile environment for new pandemics to emerge from host switching events (Delwart 2007; Fancello, Raoult, and Desnues 2012) , as was the case for SARS, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and influenza-A (H1N1) (Castillo-Chavez et al. 2015) . At present we have a limited grasp of the extent of viral diversity present in the environment: the 2014 database release from the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses classified just 7 orders, 104 families, 505 genera, and 3286 species (http://www.ictvon line.org/virustaxonomy.asp); yet, one study estimated that there are at least 320,000 virus species infecting mammals alone (Anthony et al. 2013 )."
Advance Access Publication,"The leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae), a Southeast Asian tree more commonly known as banaba, have been traditionally consumed in various forms by Philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases. In the 1990s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosolic acid. Penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG) was identified as the most potent gallotannin. A comparison of published data with results obtained for PGG indicates that PGG has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than Lagerstroemin. Chen et al. have also shown that PGG exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes. The combination of glucose uptake and anti-adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of PGG.","Type 2 diabetes has developed into a worldwide epidemic (1) . Ironically, the dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes can be attributed to the rapid economic development and correlated to changes in lifestyle within the last 50 years. Type 2 diabetes is closely associated with obesity. Up to 90% of the patients in the US with type 2 diabetes are either overweight or obese (2, 3) . It seems likely that the readily available high calorie food and a sedentary life style are major causes for obesity. Obesity contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Reducing obesity and stopping weight gain constitutes a way to slow down the rate of occurrence of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance, which is defined as defective insulin signaling and a decreased insulin efficiency to induce glucose transport from the blood into key target cells such as muscle and fat (adipocyte) cells (3) . In general, obesity leads to hyperglycemia, which in turn leads to and exacerbates insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, if not treated, results in hyperinsulinemia and eventually leads to full blown type 2 diabetes (3, 4) . Obesity or excessive adiposity, particularly visceral adiposity, contributes to and worsens insulin resistance (2, 5) . Most antidiabetic drugs are hypoglycemic or anti-hyperglycemic (blood glucose level reducing). However, most of these drugs are, to different extents, weight gain promoting (adipogenic) (6, 7) . Thus, these drugs treat one of the key symptoms of type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia, but exacerbate the condition of being overweight or obese, one of the leading causes of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, while these drugs are beneficial over the short term, they are not optimal for long term health of type 2 diabetic patient. The most desirable situation would be the development of new types of antidiabetic drugs that are either hypoglycemic or anti-hyperglycemic without the side effect of promoting weight gain (adiposity). Herbal medicines known to be useful in diabetes treatment may be able to lead to compounds with such a combination of ideal therapeutic properties (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) ."

Schmallenberg virus induces apoptosis in Vero cell line via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in a time and dose dependent manner,"Schmallenberg virus (SBV), discovered in 2011 in Germany, is associated with clinical manifestations of fever, diarrhea, reduced milk yield, abortions and congenital malformations in ruminants. Despite many studies performed for SBV, there is no detailed research on in vitro apoptotic effect of SBV. This study is aimed to determine apoptosis pathways and role of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules in Vero cells infected with SBV. The study results showed that SBV induced apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by activating both caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively. Expression analyses of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak and Puma) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) genes revealed that SBV-induced apoptosis causes upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, dominantly via Puma gene, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes were downregulated. In conclusion, this is the first detailed report about SBV induced apoptosis in the Vero cells via both extrinsic and intrinsic cascades and apoptosis induction is seem to be regulated by Puma.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. Apoptosis could occur in both physiological conditions such embryonic development, immune cell selection and in pathological status like mutations, DNA damage and certain infections [9] . Some viruses can induce or inhibit apoptosis in cells by their proteins. Inhibition of apoptosis could be needed for persistent infection and viral replication whereas induction of apoptosis could be because of lytic infection and viral spread without any inflammation. African swine fever virus, fowl poxvirus, bovine herpesvirus-5 are some viruses that inhibit apoptosis following infection of cells [5, 14, 19] . Certain apoptosis inducing viruses including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, bluetongue virus, Akabane virus, Aino and Chuzan viruses [16, 18, 24] . Although apoptotic induction of CPT-Tert and HEK-293T cell lines by SBV was detected with caspase-3/-7 activation [7] there was no information about apoptotic effect of SBV on Vero cell line. Vero cell line is widely used for SBV isolation, plaque titration and plaque reduction neutralization tests and antigen preparation [17, 31] . There is one study about apoptosis and SBV in pubmed according to our knowledge [7] . Because of inadequacy of detailed information on SBV-induced apoptosis, in present study, apoptosis in Vero cell line was investigated with DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, Annexin-V/PI staining and expression analyses of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes, further time and dose dependent analyses were performed."
Coronaviruses in avian species -review with focus on epidemiology and diagnosis in wild birds,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of enveloped viruses with a single-strand RNA genome, which continuously circulate in mammals and birds and pose a threat to livestock, companion animals, and humans. CoVs harboured by avian species are classified to the genera gamma-and deltacoronaviruses. Within the gamma-CoVs the main representative is avian coronavirus, a taxonomic name which includes the highly contagious infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) in chickens and similar viruses infecting other domestic birds such as turkeys, guinea fowls, or quails. Additionally, IBVs have been detected in healthy wild birds, demonstrating that they may act as the vector between domestic and free-living birds. Moreover, CoVs other than IBVs, are identified in wild birds, which suggests that wild birds play a key role in the epidemiology of other gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs. Development of molecular techniques has significantly improved knowledge of the prevalence of CoVs in avian species. The methods adopted in monitoring studies of CoVs in different avian species are mainly based on detection of conservative regions within the viral replicase, nucleocapsid genes, and 3'UTR or 5'UTR. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent discoveries in the areas of epidemiology and diagnosis of CoVs in avian species and to understand the role of wild birds in the virus distribution.","Among the most abundant viruses infecting a wide variety of animals, including birds and humans are representatives of the large Coronaviridae family. Their virions contain the largest single-stranded positive sense RNA (ssRNA) genome, the feature which distinguishes them from other known viral RNA genomes (19) . Similarly to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses (CoVs) are characterised by high genetic diversity driven by mutation and recombination, which can lead to the emergence of new viruses. Such new pathogens can have new features which even enable them to switch to new hosts (49) . These newly created viruses can acquire zoonotic potential, as witnessed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the epidemic from Southern China in 2003 caused by SARS-CoVs. This disease, termed ""atypical pneumonia"", was diagnosed in humans in 29 countries and had a nearly 10% mortality rate. In 2012, there emerged a subsequent disease caused by a novel coronavirus, the so-called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) with even higher mortality rates. Both SARS-and MERS-CoVs crossed the species barrier from bats to humans through civet cats and camels as intermediate organisms (17) ."
Annals of Rehabilitation Medicine Effects of 3-Dimensional Lumbar Stabilization Training for Balance in Chronic Hemiplegic Stroke Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial Improvement of Gait and Balance by Spine Balance 3 D System 973 www.e-arm.org,"Objective To investigate the effects of the newly developed Spine Balance 3D system on the balance and gait abilities of hemiplegic stroke patients. Methods Twenty-eight hemiplegic patients with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=14) or control group (n=14). The experimental and control groups performed balance training by using the newly developed Spine Balance 3D system and the well-known Biodex Balance System 30 minutes per day, three times a week for 7 weeks. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 10-m walking test (10mWT), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), the Korean version of the Fall Efficacy Scale-International (KFES-I), trunk muscle strength and stability were evaluated before and after 7 weeks of intervention. Results The 10mWT improved significantly (p=0.001) in the experimental group (using the Spine Balance 3D system) but not in the control group, and core muscle strength, which we checked using Spine Balance 3D system evaluation program, improved more in the experimental group as well. The results of the BBS, FRT, TUG, KFES-I, and Biodex Balance System evaluation program improved in both groups after 7 weeks of balance training. Conclusion We suggest that the newly-developed Spine Balance 3D system can be a more useful therapeutic tool for gait and dynamic balance rehabilitation in hemiplegic patients than a conventional 2D-based balance training system. A large-scale randomized controlled study is needed to prove the effect of this system.","A decrease in balance control can be caused by various factors, including central nervous system diseases (such as stroke and traumatic brain injury), musculoskeletal disorders (such as back pain or arthritis), and vestibular diseases. Loss of balance control decreases the ability and speed of patients' gait, especially in those with hemiplegia caused by brain damage. Fear of falling in these patients reduces their activity level and makes daily activities of living difficult for these patients. Therefore, improvements in balance control and mechanical movements are important treatment goals [1] ."
The Usefulness of Platelet-derived Microparticle as Biomarker of Antiplatelet Therapy in Kawasaki Disease,"Little is known about platelet dynamics and the effect of antiplatelet therapy in Kawasaki disease (KD). This study sought to define platelet activation dynamics in KD patients by assaying platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs). We measured plasma PDMPs levels in 46 patients with KD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected before, at 2-5 days, and 9-15 days after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, 2 months and 4-5 months after the onset of KD. We measured PDMP levels in 23 febrile and 10 afebrile control patients. In the acute phase of KD patients, PDMP levels increased significantly after IVIG treatment (12.04 ± 5.58 nmol before IVIG infusion vs. 19.81 ± 13.21 nmol at 2-5 days after IVIG infusion, P = 0.006). PDMP levels were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with procalcitonin levels in the acute phase of KD. No significant difference was found in PDMP levels between KD patients with and without coronary artery lesion (CAL). Elevated PDMP levels after IVIG therapy significantly decreased below the pre-IVIG level in subacute phase (19.81 ± 13.21 nmol at 2-5 days after IVIG infusion vs. 8.33 ± 2.02 nmol at 9-15 days after IVIG infusion, P < 0.001), and PDMP levels stayed below the pre-IVIG level in the convalescent phase, during which antiplatelet therapy was given. However, PDMP levels rebounded after discontinuing aspirin in 17 patients. In conclusion, enhanced platelet activation was noted before treatment of KD and peaked immediately after IVIG treatment. Recurrent rising of PDMP levels was observed after discontinuing aspirin, although there were no significant differences between the PDMP levels at 2 months after the onset of KD and those at 4-5 months after the onset of the disease.","Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile, systemic vasculitic syndrome of unknown etiology that occurs primarily in children younger than 5 years of age. The standard treatment of acute KD is a combination of high-dose (2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral aspirin (50 mg/kg/day). The acute phase of KD involves platelet activation, and antiplatelet therapy is included in the treatment protocol for this phase (1) . The finding of low levels of antithrombin III and depletion of the fibrinolytic system supports the concept that active intravascular clot formation and degradation occur in these patients and are most notable early in the acute phase of the disease (2) . Thrombosis mainly occurs in the artery and is associated with platelet activation in KD (3) . Following the cessation of fever for 2 to 3 days and improvement of all acute symptoms, the dosage of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) can be reduced to the minimum level necessary to inhibit platelet aggregation."
KnotInFrame: prediction of À1 ribosomal frameshift events,"Programmed À1 ribosomal frameshift (À1 PRF) allows for alternative reading frames within one mRNA. First found in several viruses, it is now believed to exist in all kingdoms of life. Strong stimulators for À1 PRF are a heptameric slippery site and an RNA pseudoknot. Here, we present a new algorithm KnotInFrame, for the automatic detection of À1 PRF signals from genomic sequences. It finds the frameshifting stimulators by means of a specialized RNA-pseudoknot folding program, fast enough for genome-wide analyses. Evaluations on known À1 PRF signals demonstrate a high sensitivity.","In the middle of the last century, George Beadle and Edward Tatum (1) proposed the 'one gene-one enzyme' theory, stating that one gene holds the genetic information of one enzyme, performing one enzymatic reaction. It was later changed to 'one gene-one polyprotein' to account for the discovery of polyproteins. However, today there are several cases which violate this assumption. By alternative splicing several protein variants are made by selecting different sets of exons from one single gene. With trans-splicing, proteins are synthesized from exons of different genes (2) . Another way of enhancing the information content of an mRNA are translational recoding events. With codon hopping (bypassing) (3), the ribosome skips over a gap in the open reading frame (ORF) and resumes translation at a downstream codon. In procaryotes, UGA codons followed by a characteristic stemloop structure are redefined from stop codons to insertion of selenocystein (4) ."
Graft-vs-tumor effect in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer treated with nonmyeloablative allogeneic PBSC transplantation,"While nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (NST) has shown efficacy against several solid tumors, it is untested in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). In a phase II clinical trial, 21 patients with pretreated metastatic NPC underwent NST with sibling PBSC allografts, using CY conditioning, thymic irradiation and in vivo T-cell depletion with thymoglobulin. Stable lymphohematopoietic chimerism was achieved in most patients and prophylactic CYA was tapered at a median of day þ 30. Seven patients (33%) showed partial response and three (14%) achieved stable disease. Four patients were alive at 2 years and three showed prolonged disease control of 344, 525 and 550 days. With a median follow-up of 209 (4-1147) days, the median PFS was 100 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 66-128 days), and median OS was 209 days (95% CI, 128-236 days). Patients with chronic GVHD had better survival-median OS 426 days (95% CI, 194-NE days) vs 143 days (95% CI, 114-226 days) (P ¼ 0.010). Thus, NST may induce meaningful clinical responses in patients with advanced NPC.","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in southern China and Southeast Asia and long-term survival for patients with advanced NPC remains poor, despite the use of salvage chemotherapy agents. 1-3 Molecular targeted therapies have not yet achieved significant benefit against NPC. Thus, novel approaches are urgently needed. Because NPC in Asia is almost universally associated with EBV, and viral oncoproteins (EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2) are expressed by tumor cells, immunotherapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy. [4] [5] [6] Studies using adoptively transferred EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in NPC have shown clinical responses in patients; [7] [8] [9] however, their overall efficacy is modest, especially in patients with metastatic and/or bulky disease."

Inflammation and Immune System Activation in Aging: A Mathematical Approach,"Memory and learning declines are consequences of normal aging. Since those functions are associated with the hippocampus, I analyzed the global gene expression data from post-mortem hippocampal tissue of 25 old (age $ 60 yrs) and 15 young (age # 45 yrs) cognitively intact human subjects. By employing a rigorous, multi-method bioinformatic approach, I identified 36 genes that were the most significant in terms of differential expression; and by employing mathematical modeling, I demonstrated that 7 of the 36 genes were able to discriminate between the old and young subjects with high accuracy. Remarkably, 90% of the known genes from those 36 most significant genes are associated with either inflammation or immune system activation. This suggests that chronic inflammation and immune system over-activity may underlie the aging process of the human brain, and that potential anti-inflammatory treatments targeting those genes may slow down this process and alleviate its symptoms.","I n the absence of any neurodegenerative disease, the aging process of the human brain is inevitably and quintessentially characterized by memory and learning impairments. Unlike in the case of a neurodegenerative disease, normal aging has not been associated with neuronal loss [1] [2] [3] . Rather, it has been observed that the impairments induced by normal aging are associated with synaptic remodeling, and that they are more likely to affect functions that are associated with the hippocampus, i.e. several areas of memory and learning 1, 2, 4 ."

Determinants Of Oral corticosteroid Responsiveness in Wheezing Asthmatic Youth (DOORWAY): protocol for a prospective multicentre cohort study of children with acute moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations Determinants Of Oral corticosteroid Responsiveness in Wheezing Asthmatic Youth (DOORWAY): protocol for a prospective multicentre cohort study of children with acute moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations,Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of acute asthma management in the emergency department.,"Of all respiratory illnesses, asthma is one of the most frequent paediatric diagnoses requiring hospital admission. 1 The burden of illness is much higher in preschool-aged children, who account for over 50% of ED visits [1] [2] [3] [4] and who have three times the hospital admission rate of older children and adolescents. 5 The difficulty in measuring asthma severity in young children has resulted in a dearth of comparative therapeutic evidence between preschoolers and older children. [6] [7] [8] [9] Treatment of acute asthma National and international guidelines for the management of acute asthma recommend: (1) inhaled ß 2agonists for all patients, (2) systemic (usually oral) corticosteroids for those with moderate and severe asthma, and (3) repeated doses of inhaled β 2 -agonists and anticholinergics for severe cases. 6;7;9;10 The latter two recommendations independently reduce admission rates by 25% in studies of predominantly school-aged children. 11;12 Several features must be noted. First, recommendations are severity-specific; patients with mild asthma do not appear to benefit from oral corticosteroids. 11;13 Second, the concept of the ""golden first hour of treatment"" supports early and aggressive asthma management, as the risk of admission is only reduced when oral corticosteroids are administered 3 to 4 hours prior to the decision to admit. Third, of all treatments administered in the ED, oral corticosteroids are by far the most effective for preventing admission. 14 Fourth, there is no equally effective substitute for oral corticosteroids;"

Characterization of respiratory infection viruses in hospitalized children from Naples province in Southern Italy,"Most acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children are due to viral etiology, and represent an important cause of mortality and morbidity in children <5 years old in developing countries. The pathogens that cause ARIs vary geographically and by season, and viruses serve a major role. In the present study, the distribution of the seven respiratory viruses that are more prevalent in Southern European countries were retrospectively analyzed in a Southern Italy Hospital, that centralizes pediatric diseases from the Naples province. Viruses were categorized by a FilmArray Respiratory Panel, and demonstrated no substantial differences in sex, age and seasonal viruses distribution. However, all the investigated viruses had a higher detection rate in the surrounding municipalities than in the metropolitan area of Naples. In recent years, the association between air pollution and respiratory infections has become an increasing public health concern. The data in this study support this association in the surrounding areas of Naples extensively contaminated by environmental toxic agents. In these areas, characterization of the epidemiology of ARIs is required to implement a prevention and control program.","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent a health issue of great importance, leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries (1) .

Rabl and Ca 2+ Are Required for the Fusion of Carrier Vesicles Mediating Endoplasmic Reticulum to Golgi Transport,Members of the rab/YPTI/SEC4 gene family,"of small molecular weight GTPases play key roles in the regulation of vesicular traffic between compartments of the exocyfic pathway. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that a dominant negative rabla mutant, rabla(N124I), defective for guanine nucleotide binding in vitro, leads to the accumulation of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) in numerous pre-cis-Golgi vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters containing rabl and B-COP, a subunit of the coatomer complex. Similar to previous observations (Balch et al. 1994. Cell. 76:841-852) , VSV-G was concentrated nearly 5-1G-fold in vesicular carriers that aocumulate in the presence of the rabla(N124I) mutant. VSV-G containing vesicles and vesiculartubular clusters were also found to accumulate in the presence of a rabla effector domain peptide mimetic that inhibits endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, as well as in the absence of Ca 2+. These results suggest that the combined action of a Ca2+-dependent prorein and conformational changes associated with the GTPase cycle of rabl are essential for a late targeting/fusion step controlling the delivery of vesicles to Golgi compartments. T HE biochemical mechanisms underlying vesicular transport between compartments of the exocytic and endocytic pathways are poorly understood, but are likely to involve the ordered assembly and disassembly of protein complexes that regulate vesicle budding, targeting, and fusion (reviewed in Pryer et al., 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992) . It is now evident that a collection of GTPases belonging to the rab/YPT/SEC4, A~ Sad, and beterotrimeric G~, families serve as molecular switches to control diverse functions of the transport machinery (reviewed in Goud and McCatfrey, 1991; Barr et al., 1992; Zerial and Stenmark, 1993; . In particular, transport from the ER to and between Golgi compartments in mammalian cells requires the small GTPase rabl. Neutralizing antibodies (Plutuer et al., 1991; Schwaninger et al., 1992; Davidson and Balch, 1993; Peter et al., 1993) and rabl-specific peptides Balch et al., 1993) block transport in vitro. In addition, trans-dominant mutants with altered guanine nucleotide-binding properties inhibit transport in vivo (Tisdale et al., 1992) and in vitro Davidson and Balch, 1993) ."
Construction of fat1 Gene Expression Vector and Its Catalysis Efficiency in Bovine Fetal Fibroblast Cells,"The FAT-1 protein is an n-3 fatty acid desaturase, which can recognize a range of 18-and 20-carbon n-6 substrates and transform n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into n-3 PUFAs while n-3 PUFAs have beneficial effect on human health. Fat1 gene is the coding sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans which might play an important role on lipometabolism. To reveal the function of fat1 gene in bovine fetal fibroblast cells and gain the best cell nuclear donor for transgenic bovines, the codon of fat1 sequence was optimized based on the codon usage frequency preference of bovine muscle protein, and directionally cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-GFP. After identifying by restrictive enzyme digests with AatII/XbaI and sequencing, the fusion plasmid pEF-GFP-fat1 was identified successfully. The pEF-GFP-fat1 vector was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells mediated by Lipofectamine2000 TM . The positive bovine fetal fibroblast cells were selected by G418 and detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that a 1,234 bp transcription was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and the positive transgenic fat1 cell line was successfully established. Then the expression level of fat1 gene in positive cells was detected using quantitative PCR, and the catalysis efficiency was detected by gas chromatography. The results demonstrated that the catalysis efficiency of fat1 was significantly high, which can improve the total PUFAs rich in EPA, DHA and DPA. Construction and expression of pEF-GFP-fat1 vector should be helpful for further understanding the mechanism of regulation of fat1 in vitro. It could also be the first step in the production of fat1 transgenic cattle. (","Fatty acids are usually unbranched and contain an even number of carbon atoms, usually from 12 to 20. Fats containing one double bond are monounstaturated and those with more than one double bond are polyunsaturated. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential components required for normal cellular function and play a particularly important role in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields (Lopez-Huertas, 2010) . Thereamong, Arachidonic acid (AA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) play a key role in growth and development of an organism and are usually referred to as highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) (Norsker and Støttrup, 1994) . A rational balanced level of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids is important, and it was found that the ideal n-6/n-3 ratio is 1:1 (Enser et al., 1996; Enser et al., 1998) . Several n-3 fatty acid desaturase genes were studied in different species, like plants and algae (Meesapyodsuk et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2004; Sakuradani et al., 2005) . These studies revealed that transgenic n-3 fatty acid desaturase genes were efficient in optimizing both kinds and proportions of PUFAs in tissues. The fat1 gene from Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) codes the FAT-1 protein, a 402 amino acid n-3 fatty acid desaturase which can transform C18 and C20 n-6 PUFAs into n-3 PUFAs. Supplementing n-3 PUFAs intake may be of benefit in human health. Currently, the study of fat1 gene is becoming an important topic in transgene research, and there have been many important breakthroughs. For instance, Lai et al. (2006) produced the first fat1 transgenic pig (Lai et al., 2006) , which produced high levels of n-3 fatty acids from n-6 analogs, and their tissues have a significantly reduced ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids, but the production of the 22C n-3 PUFAs (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA and DHA) which has a higher nutritive value was still at a low level (Pan et al., 2009) . A more thorough investigation of n-3 PUFAs and the effects of global climate change indicated that there would be a potential shortage of n-3 PUFAs in human diets (Kang, 2011) . It is becoming clear that fat1 transgenic cattle with higher levels of n-3 PUFAs are becoming more urgent than ever. Unfortunately, many of the attempts to express fat1 in a transgenic background do not work well because of the difficulty of gene priming and expression in a different species."
Lipid rafts and Alzheimer's disease: protein-lipid interactions and perturbation of signaling,"Lipid rafts are membrane domains, more ordered than the bulk membrane and enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. They represent a platform for protein-lipid and proteinprotein interactions and for cellular signaling events. In addition to their normal functions, including membrane trafficking, ligand binding (including viruses), axonal development and maintenance of synaptic integrity, rafts have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipid rafts promote interaction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the secretase (BACE-1) responsible for generation of the amyloid β peptide, Aβ. Rafts also regulate cholinergic signaling as well as acetylcholinesterase and Aβ interaction. In addition, such major lipid raft components as cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside have been directly implicated in pathogenesis of the disease. Perturbation of lipid raft integrity can also affect various signaling pathways leading to cellular death and AD. In this review, we discuss modulation of APP cleavage by lipid rafts and their components, while also looking at more recent findings on the role of lipid rafts in signaling events.","It has traditionally been difficult to reach any kind of consensus concerning the definition of lipid rafts. However, in 2006 at the Keystone Symposium on Lipid Rafts and Cell Function in Colorado it was agreed that ""membrane rafts are small (10-200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol, and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through proteinprotein and protein-lipid interactions"" (Pike, 2006) . The long, saturated acyl chains of sphingolipids allow tight packing hence their juxtaposition with the kinked, unsaturated acyl chains of bulk membrane phospholipids leads to phase separation (Brown and London, 2000) . The cholesterol molecules can act as ""spacers,"" filling any gaps in sphingolipid packing (Simons and Ikonen, 1997) ."
Analysis of Ebola Virus Entry Into Macrophages,"Ebolaviruses constitute a public health threat, particularly in Central and Western Africa. Host cell factors required for spread of ebolaviruses may serve as targets for antiviral intervention. Lectins, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, Mer), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) proteins, integrins, and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) have been reported to promote entry of ebolaviruses into certain cellular systems. However, the factors used by ebolaviruses to invade macrophages, major viral targets, are poorly defined. Here, we show that mannose-specific lectins, TIM-1 and Axl augment entry into certain cell lines but do not contribute to Ebola virus (EBOV)-glycoprotein (GP)-driven transduction of macrophages. In contrast, expression of Mer, integrin αV, and NPC1 was required for efficient GP-mediated transduction and EBOV infection of macrophages. These results define cellular factors hijacked by EBOV for entry into macrophages and, considering that Mer and integrin αV promote phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, support the concept that EBOV relies on apoptotic mimicry to invade target cells.","Viruses of the genus Ebolavirus within the family Filoviridae can cause severe disease in humans and nonhuman primates [1] . Ebola virus disease (EVD) is endemic in sub-Saharan and Western Africa, with the largest ever recorded EVD outbreak currently unfolding in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia [2] . The import of ebolaviruses into Europe and the United States via infected travelers or infected nonhuman primates highlight the fact that EVD constitutes a global health threat [1, 3, 4] . However, neither approved vaccines nor therapeutics are currently available to combat EVD. Host cell factors exploited by ebolaviruses for viral amplification constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention, and a blockade of the factors required for the first step in viral replication, entry into target cells, might be particularly attractive."
Advancing a multivalent 'Pan-anthelmintic' vaccine against soil-transmitted nematode infections,"The Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership is developing a Pan-anthelmintic vaccine that simultaneously targets the major soil-transmitted nematode infections, in other words, ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infection. The approach builds off the current bivalent Human Hookworm Vaccine now in clinical development and would ultimately add both a larval Ascaris lumbricoides antigen and an adult-stage Trichuris trichiura antigen from the parasite stichosome. Each selected antigen would partially reproduce the protective immunity afforded by UV-attenuated Ascaris eggs and Trichuris stichosome extracts, respectively. Final antigen selection will apply a ranking system that includes the evaluation of expression yields and solubility, feasibility of process development and the absence of circulating antigen-specific IgE among populations living in helminth-endemic regions. Here we describe a five year roadmap for the antigen discovery, feasibility and antigen selection, which will ultimately lead to the scale-up expression, process development, manufacture, good laboratory practices toxicology and preclinical evaluation, ultimately leading to Phase 1 clinical testing.","The Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership is developing a Pan-anthelmintic vaccine that simultaneously targets the major soil-transmitted nematode infections, in other words, ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infection.

Inhibitor-Based Therapeutics for Treatment of Viral Hepatitis,"Viral hepatitis remains a significant worldwide threat, in spite of the availability of several successful therapeutic and vaccination strategies. Complications associated with acute and chronic infections, such as liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, are the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Given the significant burden on the healthcare system caused by viral hepatitis, it is essential that novel, more effective therapeutics be developed. The present review attempts to summarize the current treatments against viral hepatitis, and provides an outline for upcoming, promising new therapeutics. Development of novel therapeutics requires an understanding of the viral life cycles and viral effectors in molecular detail. As such, this review also discusses virallyencoded effectors, found to be essential for virus survival and replication in the host milieu, which may be utilized as potential candidates for development of alternative therapies in the future.","Hepatitis is a medical condition wherein the liver undergoes inflammation due to a plethora of reasons, including drug abuse, excessive alcohol abuse, disease conditions etc. 1 When such inflammation, as manifested in symptoms such as jaundice, nausea, abdominal pain, malaise etc, is caused by viral infections, the condition is referred to as viral hepatitis. 1 Five hepatotropic virusesnamed hepatitis A, B, C, D and E virusestarget liver cells in humans and cause acute and chronic hepatitis. In addition, other viruses such as the adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), occasionally cause symptoms of hepatitis. 2 While an acute infection in healthy, immunocompetent individuals is cleared spontaneously, complications like cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) may arise in immunocompromised individuals, due to associated secondary reasons such as existing infections, alcohol abuse, or genetic predisposition. 1,3 HCC, the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 4 is closely associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Even though the therapeutic strategies devised till date are targeted towards chronic infections, treatment options become severely limited for advanced stage patients. 1 In addition, current medications have significant side-effects, which poses an issue with disease management. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for safer and more potent drugs."
Effect of hepatocyte growth factor and angiotensin II on rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES AND CLINICAL INVESTIGATION Effect of hepatocyte growth factor and angiotensin II on rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays an important role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The combined effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Ang II on cardiomyocytes is unknown. The present study was designed to determine the effect of HGF on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to explore the combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and cultured in vitro. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 µM) alone, HGF (10 ng/mL) alone, and Ang II (1 µM) plus HGF (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The amount of [ 3 H]-leucine incorporation was then measured to evaluate protein synthesis. The mRNA levels of β-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor were determined by real-time PCR to evaluate the presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression. The cell size of cardiomyocytes was also studied. Ang II (1 µM) increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Similar to Ang II, treatment with 1 µM HGF promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the combination of 1 µM Ang II and 10 ng/mL HGF clearly induced a combined pro-hypertrophy effect on cardiomyocytes. The present study demonstrates for the first time a novel, combined effect of HGF and Ang II in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","Myocardial hypertrophy is defined as a thickening of the myocardium, which results in a decrease in the size of the chamber of the heart, including the left and right ventricles, and is an important risk factor for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology and role of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in heart disease have been intensively investigated; however, to date they are only partially understood. Cardiac hypertrophic growth is the primary responsive mechanism by which the heart reduces stress on the ventricular wall. Conventional views suggest that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a compensatory response to increased hemodynamic overload, which leads to cardiac disease. However, recent findings in genetic animal models of myocardial hypertrophy as well as human studies have revealed support for a molecular basis whereby either compensatory or maladaptive forms of hypertrophy exist, and only the latter lead to cardiac failure (1) . In the case of myocardial infarction, hypertrophic responses occur in cardiomyocytes in the surviving portion of the ventricle, and ventricular dilatation follows as a result of re-organization of the myocardium, including cardiomyocytes and mesenchymal cells in combination (2, 3) . To execute this response, the cardiomyocytes are stimulated by neurohumoral factors and subsequent intracellular reactive cascade systems. All of these processes entail an increase in protein synthesis as well as the size and architectural rearrangement within individual cardiomyocytes."
What Have We Learned About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Emergence in Humans? A Systematic Literature Review,"Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Results: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown. There have been sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East. Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include environmental contamination. Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials.","S eptember 2012 saw the identification of a novel human coronavirus, now known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (ProMED-mail 2012, Zaki et al. 2012) . MERS-CoV is a beta-coronavirus distinct from but genetically related to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (Hilgenfeld and Peiris 2013, de Wit et al. 2016) ."
Viruses causing lower respiratory symptoms in young children: findings from the ORChID birth cohort Respiratory infection,"Introduction Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause substantial child morbidity. Sensitive molecularbased assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2 years of life. Methods One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. Results Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms. Discussion The strong association of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus with ARIs and lower respiratory symptoms in young children managed within the community indicates successful development of vaccines against these two viruses should provide substantial health benefits.","Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children, either on their own or in synergy with bacterial pathogens. 1 Virus-positive ARIs early in life are associated with developing wheeze and asthma during childhood and adolescence. 2 Community-based studies from the 1950s to 1960s examining the aetiology of ARIs by traditional laboratory detection methods remain the template for understanding childhood respiratory virus epidemiology. 3 Advances in molecular diagnostics, including PCR testing, have improved virus detection in those with ARIs. 4 However, this increased test sensitivity has also resulted in viruses being detected in asymptomatic individuals. 4 5 The clinical significance of finding respiratory viruses is not always straightforward, and a better understanding of the proportion of infections that are symptomatic for individual viruses is needed."
Case Report,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lung cancer histological subtype unusual in its favorable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Life-threatening manifestations at presentation are rarely reported and should be an important clinical concern. We report a case of a 63-yearold man presenting with rapid-onset refractory severe thrombocytopenia, development of massive hemoptysis, and death from respiratory failure. This case provides clinicians a reference for this unusual presentation and carries clinical implications for managing SCLC patients.","Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 15-20% of all lung cancers [1] . SCLC differs from non-small-cell lung cancer in its rapid tumor doubling time, high growth fraction, early development of widespread metastasis, and better response to platinum doublets chemotherapy. Thus chemotherapy is a treatment mainstay, even in poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status [2, 3] . Bone marrow involvement or paraneoplastic syndrome is common in patients with SCLC [4] . Hematologic abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are reported to be occasionally accompanied by bone marrow metastasis or paraneoplastic phenomenon [5, 6] . However, complications such as fatal hemorrhage are rarely reported. The clinical presentation can make diagnosis or treatment difficult. Herein, we report an SCLC patient who presented with rapid-onset, refractory severe thrombocytopenia and development of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage."
Overproduction of IL-6 and Type-I IFN in a Lethal Case of Chikungunya Virus Infection in an Elderly Man During the 2017 Italian Outbreak,"Chikungunya fever is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and is generally considered a self-limiting disease. However, severe clinical presentations with a high mortality rate have been reported in association with underlying medical conditions. This study reports the molecular characterization of the virus and an abnormal pattern of circulating cytokines in a unique lethal CHIKV case during the 2017 outbreak in Italy, which involved an elderly patient with underlying cardiac disease. Analysis of inflammatory cytokines revealed a strong increase of interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β, as well as interleukin-6, suggesting a possible role of type-I IFN in the cytokine storm, which may be correlated with unfavorable prognosis of CHIKV infection.","and Calabria regions (http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/temi/ documenti/chikungunya/bollettino_chikungunya_ULTIMO. pdf).

In addition, CHIKV represents a substantial health burden to affected populations, with symptoms that include severe joint and muscle pain, rashes, and fever, as well as prolonged periods of disability in some patients [1] . We report an extensive virus characterization based on the whole genome sequence and an abnormal pattern of circulating cytokines in a lethal case of CF during the 2017 Lazio region outbreak."
An Unconventional Role for Cytoplasmic Disulfide Bonds in Vaccinia Virus Proteins,"Previous data have shown that reducing agents disrupt the structure of vaccinia virus (vv). Here, we have analyzed the disulfide bonding of vv proteins in detail. In vv-infected cells cytoplasmically synthesized vv core proteins became disulfide bonded in the newly assembled intracellular mature viruses (IMVs). vv membrane proteins also assembled disulfide bonds, but independent of IMV formation and to a large extent on their cytoplasmic domains. If disulfide bonding was prevented, virus assembly was only partially impaired as shown by electron microscopy as well as a biochemical assay of IMV formation. Under these con-ditions, however, the membranes around the isolated particles appeared less stable and detached from the underlying core. During the viral infection process the membrane proteins remained disulfide bonded, whereas the core proteins were reduced, concomitant with delivery of the cores into the cytoplasm. Our data show that vv has evolved an unique system for the assembly of cytoplasmic disulfide bonds that are localized both on the exterior and interior parts of the IMV.","T HE formation of disulfide bonds during (re)folding of proteins in vitro has been well documented (reviewed in 15). Most of the recent interest in protein folding, however, has concentrated on the folding and disulfide bond formation in (mammalian) cells. It is now well accepted that disulfide bonding and folding of proteins occur in the lumen of the ER. The unique (GSH/GSSG) 1 ratio (of ‫ف‬ 3:1) within the lumen of this compartment is thought to provide it with a redox potential that, in contrast to the cytosol (ratio 100:1), is oxidizing enough to favor disulfide bonding (24). Moreover, the ER lumen contains a variety of molecular chaperones that assist in the folding reactions (for review see 17, 19, 20) . Finally, this compartment is equipped with an abundant nonmembrane protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), that from in vitro experiments (3, 5) , as well as from genetic evidence (36), plays an important role in the disulfide bonding of proteins in the ER. PDI contains two, thioredoxinlike motifs, a sequence of 11 amino acids that aligns with a corresponding sequence in the Escherichia coli thiore-doxin protein (reviewed in 15, 16) . This latter protein may be involved in catalyzing reduction (21) . Other proteins that contain thioredoxin motifs include glutaredoxin (21), E. coli DsbA (the E. coli equivalent of PDI), and the ER proteins ERp72 and ERp60. These proteins contain the characteristic active site sequence composed of CXXC in which the cysteine residues act as redox-active groups (16). Viral membrane proteins have been used extensively to study the disulfide bonding and folding processes in the ER lumen (reviewed in 10). They appear to follow the same rules as cellular proteins in that they are inserted in a cotranslational manner into the ER where they undergo folding and oligomerization reactions. Moreover, they provide an advantage over cellular proteins in being abundantly expressed upon viral infection, thus facilitating detailed studies of these processes. Recent results using the well-characterized influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein, have shown that upon addition of DTT to living cells, newly synthesized HA remains reduced in the lumen of the ER while already synthesized and disulfide bonded molecules become reduced as long as they resided inside the ER (2). This observation has subsequently been tested with other proteins, mostly with similar results (for example see 37, 45, 56) ."

Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infections, but little is known about PIV infection in children and adults in Africa, especially in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is high.","Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a paramyxovirus commonly detected in patients with respiratory illness, such as upper respiratory tract infections, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), or pneumonia. There are 4 distinct types: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Parainfluenza virus infection is most common in childhood, and serologic surveys have shown that nearly all children have antibodies to PIV by 5 years of age [1, 2] . Parainfluenza virus is associated with 3%-10% of hospitalized respiratory tract infections in children and adults [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Parainfluenza virus infections occur throughout the year, but there are recognized patterns of seasonality associated with different types [11] . The clinical significance of identifying PIV infection among patients with respiratory illness does not necessarily imply causation because the virus may be found in individuals without respiratory symptoms [12] ."
IDBD: Infectious Disease Biomarker Database,"Biomarkers enable early diagnosis, guide molecularly targeted therapy and monitor the activity and therapeutic responses across a variety of diseases. Despite intensified interest and research, however, the overall rate of development of novel biomarkers has been falling. Moreover, no solution is yet available that efficiently retrieves and processes biomarker information pertaining to infectious diseases. Infectious Disease Biomarker Database (IDBD) is one of the first efforts to build an easily accessible and comprehensive literature-derived database covering known infectious disease biomarkers. IDBD is a community annotation database, utilizing collaborative Web 2.0 features, providing a convenient user interface to input and revise data online. It allows users to link infectious diseases or pathogens to protein, gene or carbohydrate biomarkers through the use of search tools. It supports various types of data searches and application tools to analyze sequence and structure features of potential and validated biomarkers. Currently, IDBD integrates 611 biomarkers for 66 infectious diseases and 70 pathogens. It is publicly accessible at","Infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. About 15 million (>25%) of 57 million annual deaths are estimated to be related directly to infectious diseases (1) . Newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases constitute an urgent and ongoing threat to public health throughout the world. The discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has led to renewed appreciation of the consequences of the emergence of infectious diseases. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southern China in 2002 and has had a profound impact on public health (2) . Influenza viruses possess evolutionary agility and the capacity to jump between fowl, farm animal and human species (3) . Just as troubling are chronic infections, which create persistent social and economic havoc. Recent studies have shown that the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with certain infectious diseases falls primarily on infants and young children (4) , with long-term social and economic consequences."
Assessing Continuous Quality Improvement in Public Health: Adapting Lessons from Healthcare Évaluation de l' amélioration continue de la qualité en santé publique : adapter les leçons des services de santé,"Context: Evidence of the effect of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in public health and valid tools to judge that such effects are not fully formed. Objective: The objective was to adapt and apply Shortell et al.' s (1998) four dimensions of CQI in an examination of a public health accountability and performance management initiative in Ontario, Canada. Methods: In total, 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with informants from public health units and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. A web survey of public health managers in the province was also carried out. Results: A mix of facilitators and barriers was identified. Leadership and organizational cultures, conducive to CQI success were evident. However, limitations in performance measurement and managerial discretion were key barriers. Conclusion: The four dimensions of CQI provided insight into both facilitators and barriers of CQI adoption in public health. Future research should compare the outcomes of public health CQI initiatives to the framework' s stated facilitators and barriers.","This study examines the implementation of a public health accountability and performance management system featuring declared principles of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in Ontario, Canada.

The approach stands in contrast to quality control and assurance by virtue of its focus on identifying opportunities to improve work processes as opposed to identifying individualized problems and maintaining a status quo (Dever 1997) . CQI relies heavily on performance measurement and analysis, as well as on the involvement of leadership and front-line staff in decision-making processes (Kosseff 1992; McLaughlin 1987; Radawski 1999) ."
"Epidemiology, Outcome and Risk Factors Analysis of Viral Infections in Children and Adolescents Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Antiviral Drugs Do Not Prevent Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation","Objective: The analysis of epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Methods: In this multicenter nationwide study a total of 971 HCT procedures (741 allo-HCT; 230 auto-HCT) over a period of 6 years were analyzed. Results: During this period 801 episodes of viral infections were diagnosed in 442 patients. The incidence of viral infections was 57.9% in allo-HCT and 4.8% in auto-HCT patients. The most frequent infections after allo-HCT were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyoma BK virus (BKV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The majority of infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 (for CMV) days. The highest mortality was observed in case of CMV infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (a/cGVHD), and matched unrelated donor (MUD)/mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)-HCT. The risk factor for death from viral infection were CMV-IgG seropositivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia recipient, and MUD/MMUD-HCT. The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection and treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of EBV-DNA-emia with need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% cases. In 47.7% of these cases, GVHD was a factor enabling development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infection. Conclusion: We have shown that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients.","Infections are the major cause of mobility and mortality in children who are undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or chemotherapy due to malignancy. [1] [2] [3] According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), infectious complications were the cause of death in 7% of autologous HCT (auto-HCT), 11% of matched sibling donor HCT (MSD-HCT) and 13% of matched unrelated donor HCT (MUD-HCT) recipients. 2 Infectious complications in children after HCT were noted in 82% of children after allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) 4 and in 21% of children with solid tumor or lymphoma in pediatric auto-HCT setting. 5 The incidence of viral infection after allo-HCT was observed in 19.3% of patients during the first 30 days after transplantation, 18.5% between 31 and 100 days, and in 20% after day +101 up to 2 years after HCT. 4 In the auto-HCT setting viral infections were observed only in 11% of patients with median onset of 10 days post-transplant. 5 Viruses that cause infection after HCT can be classified as latent or ""episodic"" in nature, with the latter acquired typically after exposure rather than as a result of a reactivation event. 6 In the early post-transplant period herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation was the most frequent viral infection both in allo-HCT and auto-HCT patients. 4, 5 Overall, 8% of allo-HCT patient died primarily due to infections and 24% of these infections were viral. 4 In auto-HCT patients deaths due to infections were episodic. 5 Some major improvements in outcomes were associated with the application of drugs and molecular tests to detect and prevent early bacterial infections, HSV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and pre-engraftment candidal infections. 6 Screening for reactivation with pre-emptive treatment or application of prophylaxis in seropositive recipients plays a role in preventing diseases caused by latent herpesviruses such as CMV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and varicellazoster virus (VZV). 6 Implementation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for management of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, on the basis of monitoring of EBV-DNA-emia and pre-emptive or targeted therapy with rituximab, has reduced the incidence of mortality from post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-PTLD) from 84% before the year 2000 to 30% in 2013. 7 Ganciclovir (GCV) can reduce EBV replication, but neither ganciclovir/foscarnet (FCV) nor cidofovir (CDV) therapy/prophylaxis have any impact on development of EBV-PTLD, so antiviral agents are not recommended. 8 In this multicenter nationwide study we present analysis of the epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents after HCT over a period of 72 consecutive months. Special attention was given to antiviral drugs usage and incidence of EBV infection after HCT."
Intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor in a cat,"A 12-year-old, 3.6-kg, spayed female domestic shorthaired cat had a 2-month history of anorexia and weight loss. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed an exophytic mass originating from the jejunum with very poor central and poor peripheral contrast enhancement. On day 14, surgical resection of the jejunum and mass with 5-cm margins and an end-to-end anastomosis were performed. Histopathological examination revealed the mass was a transmural, invasive cancer showing exophytic growth and originating from the small intestinal muscle layer. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor cells revealed diffuse positivity for KIT protein and negativity for desmin and S-100. The mass was diagnosed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Ultrasonographic findings indicated the tumor probably metastasized to the liver and omentum, as seen in humans and dogs. The owner rejected further treatment at the last visit on day 192. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal tumor and metastasis in feline GIST and its imaging features.","(approximately 5.0 mm) (Fig. 2B ) and performed cytological examination of a fine-needle aspirate.

A multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction panel for detecting neurologic pathogens in dogs with meningoencephalitis,"Meningoencephalitis (ME) is a common inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system in dogs. Clinically, ME has both infectious and non-infectious causes. In the present study, a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) panel was optimized for the detection of eight canine neurologic pathogens (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus spp., Neospora caninum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, and canine distemper virus [CDV]). The mqPCR panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from dogs with ME. The analytic sensitivity (i.e., limit of detection, expressed as molecules per 1 L of recombinant vector) was 3.8 for CDV, 3.7 for Ehrlichia canis, 3.7 for Bartonella spp., 3.8 for Borrelia burgdorferi, 3.7 for Blastomyces dermatitidis, 3.7 for Cryptococcus spp., 38 for Neospora caninum, and 3.7 for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the tested CSF samples, seven (15%) were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency: Cryptococcus spp. (3/7), Blastomyces dermatitidis (2/7), and Borrelia burgdorferi (2/7). In summary, use of an mqPCR panel with high analytic sensitivity as an initial screen for infectious agents in dogs with ME could facilitate the selection of early treatment strategies and improve outcomes.","Meningoencephalitis (ME) results from concurrent inflammation of the meninges (meningitis) and brain (encephalitis) [22] . ME can be classified as granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, or necrotizing leukoencephalitis based on histopathologic features [28] . However, in veterinary practice, this classification is challenging because it requires biopsy and histopathologic examination. Thus, a simple and rapid strategy for identifying the causative agent of ME would be useful for selecting an appropriate therapeutic regimen."
Spread of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus: Genetic versus Epidemiological Data,Here we use novel methods of phylogenetic transmission graph analysis to reconstruct the geographic spread of MERS-CoV. We compare these results to those derived from text mining and visualization of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Disease Outbreak News.,"MERS-CoV was discovered in 2012 in the Middle East and human cases around the world have been carefully reported by the WHO. MERS-CoV virus is a novel betacoronavirus closely related to a virus (NeoCov) hosted by a bat, Neoromicia capensis. MERS-CoV infects humans and camels. In 2015, MERS-CoV spread from the Middle East to South Korea which sustained an outbreak. Thus, it is clear that the virus can spread among humans in areas in which camels are not husbanded."

Differential network as an indicator of osteoporosis with network entropy,"Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density. The peak bone mass (PBM) is a significant determinant of osteoporosis. To gain insights into the indicating effect of PBM to osteoporosis, this study focused on characterizing the PBM networks and identifying key genes. One biological data set with 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples was derived to construct protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. We constructed 32 destination networks with 66 modules divided from monocyte low and high PBM networks. Among them, network 11 was the only significantly differential one (P<0.05) with 8 nodes and 28 edges. All genes belonged to precursors of osteoclasts, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. In conclusion, based on the entropy in PBM PPINs, the differential network appears to be a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression; these findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.","Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density, which results in an increased risk of fractures among the elderly (1) . Women, especially postmenopausal women, are more susceptible to osteoporosis comparad to other groups. Bone mass and strength achieved at the end of the growth period is defined as peak bone mass (PBM), which is a significant determinant of osteoporosis (2, 3) . It is regarded that an increase of PBM by one standard deviation would reduce the fracture risk by 50% (4) ."
Replication enhancer elements within the open reading frame of tick-borne encephalitis virus and their evolution within the Flavivirus genus,"We provide experimental evidence of a replication enhancer element (REE) within the capsid gene of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, genus Flavivirus). Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem-loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a human pathogen that causes about 16 000 human cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) across Europe and Asia annually (1) (2) (3) . Taxonomically, TBEV is a species within the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses (mTBFV). Together with the seabird tick-borne flavivirus group (sTBFV), they comprise one ecological group of tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV) within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Two other ecological groups within the genus Flavivirus are the mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV) and flaviviruses with no-known vector (NKV) (4) . A fourth group including Kamiti River virus (KRV) (5) , cell fusion agent virus (CFAV) (6) and Culex flavivirus (CuFV) (7) have been isolated only from mosquitoes with no demonstrated capacity to replicate in mammals and are under consideration by the ICTV Committee for classification as 'probably arthropod-borne viruses' (PABV)."
O-Glycosylation of Intact and Truncated Ribophorins in Brefeldin A-Treated Cells: Newly Synthesized Intact Ribophorins Are Only Transiently Accessible to the Relocated Glycosyltransferases,Ribophorins I and II are type I transmembrane glycoproteins of the ER that are segregated to the rough domains of this organelle. Both ribophorins appear to be part of the translocation apparatus for nascent polypeptides that is associated with membranebound ribosomes and participate in the formation of a proteinaceous network within the ER membrane that also includes other components of the translocation apparatus. The ribophorins are both highly stable proteins that lack O-linked sugars but each contains one high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide that remains endo H sensitive throughout their lifetimes.,"sequential addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and terminal sialic acid residues. Addition of O-linked sugars affected all newly synthesized RI332 molecules and was completed soon after synthesis with a half time of about 10 rain. In the same cells, intact ribophorins I and II also underwent O-linked glycosylation in the presence of BFA, but these molecules were modified only during a short time period immediately after their synthesis was completed, and the modification affected only a fraction of the newly synthesized polypeptides. More important, these molecules synthesized before the addition of BFA were not modified by O-glycosylation. The same is true for ribophorin I when overexpressed in HeLa cells although it is significantly less stable than the native polypeptide in control cells. We, therefore, conclude that soon after their synthesis, ribophorins lose their susceptibility to the relocated Golgi enzymes that effect the O-glycosylation, most likely as a consequence of a conformational change in the ribophorins that occurs during their maturation, although it cannot be excluded that rapid integration of these molecules into a supramolecular complex in the ER membrane leads to their inaccessibility to these enzymes. IBOPHORINS I and II are two well characterized, highly stable ER resident glycoproteins that have a type I (N, luminal; C, cytoplasmic) transmembrane disposition and bear high mannose oligosaccharides in their luminal segments (Rosenfeld et al., 1984; Harnik-Ort et al., 1987; Crimaudo et al., 1987) . These proteins are segregated to the rough domains of the ER (Kreibich et al., 1978a, b; Macantonio et al., 1984; Amar-Costesec et al., 1984) and"
Virome Capture Sequencing Enables Sensitive Viral Diagnosis and Comprehensive Virome Analysis,"Insensitivity and technical complexity have impeded the implementation of high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing in differential diagnosis of viral infections in clinical laboratories. Here, we describe the development of a virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. The system uses~2 million probes that cover the genomes of members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans. A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the NimbleGen cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and host nucleic acids. The use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100-to 10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and RiboZero rRNA subtraction. VirCapSeq-VERT had a limit of detection comparable to that of agent-specific real-time PCR in serum, blood, and tissue extracts. Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were approximately 40% different from the known virus genomes used for designing the probe library. The VirCapSeq-VERT platform is ideally suited for analyses of virome composition and dynamics. IMPORTANCE VirCapSeq-VERT enables detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational simplicity and efficiency of the VirCapSeq-VERT platform may facilitate transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as research applications.","to select 100-mer oligonucleotides spaced by approximately 25 to 50 nucleotides (nt) along each sequence. To address sequence variation, oligonucleotide mutant or variant sequences were retained if sequences diverged by more than 90%. Where technical complexity in oligonucleotide synthesis was challenging due to melting temperature (T m ) or homopolymer repeats, probe sequences were refined by shortening and adjusting their start/stop positions. The final library comprised 1,993,176 oligonucleotides ranging in length from 50 to 100 nt and in T m from 58.7°C to 101°C (see Table S2 in the supplemental material)."

PhEVER: a database for the global exploration of virus-host evolutionary relationships,"Fast viral adaptation and the implication of this rapid evolution in the emergence of several new infectious diseases have turned this issue into a major challenge for various research domains. Indeed, viruses are involved in the development of a wide range of pathologies and understanding how viruses and host cells interact in the context of adaptation remains an open question. In order to provide insights into the complex interactions between viruses and their host organisms and namely in the acquisition of novel functions through exchanges of genetic material, we developed the PhEVER database. This database aims at providing accurate evolutionary and phylogenetic information to analyse the nature of virus-virus and virus-host lateral gene transfers. PhEVER (http:// pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/databases/phever) is a unique database of homologous families both (i) between sequences from different viruses and (ii) between viral sequences and sequences from cellular organisms. PhEVER integrates extensive data from up-to-date completely sequenced genomes (2426 non-redundant viral genomes, 1007 non-redundant prokaryotic genomes, 43 eukaryotic genomes ranging from plants to vertebrates) and offers a clustering of proteins into homologous families containing at least one viral sequences, as well as alignments and phylogenies for each of these families. Public access to PhEVER is available through its webpage and through all dedicated ACNUC retrieval systems.","Viruses are responsible for a large number of infectious diseases and cancers. Recently, new viral diseases have emerged leading to severe consequences on human activities. The emergence of many of these new viruses can be attributed to recombining viruses as well as to host species jump (1) (2) (3) . Therefore, understanding how viruses interact with their hosts and more specifically how the complex interactions between viruses and their host organisms are acquired and maintained throughout evolution, remains a major challenge (4) (5) (6) (7) . In order to assess this question, it is of prime importance to be able to detect and quantify the occurrence of lateral gene transfer events, and the impact of these events on viralhost co-evolution. Indeed, the mechanisms behind fast viral adaptation are far from being elucidated. Thus, we developed a global approach aimed at providing accurate evolutionary and phylogenetic information to tackle these questions."

,"Purpose: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can cause various neurological complications. This study aimed to investigate the RSV-associated neurologic manifestations that present with seizures. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged less than 15 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infections and seizures between January 2011 and December 2016 in a regional hospital in South Korea. Results: During this period, 1,193 patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were identified. Of these, 35 (35 of 1,193, 2.93%; boys, 19; girls, 16; mean age: 20.8 ± 16.6 months) presented with sei zure. Febrile seizure was the most common diagnosis (27 of 35, 77.1%); simple febrile seizures in 13 patients (13 of 27, 48.1%) and complex febrile seizures in 14 (14 of 27, 51.9%). Afebrile seizures without meningitis or encephalo pathy were observed in 5 patients (5 of 35, 14.3%), seizures with meningitis in 2 (2 of 35, 5.7%), and seizure with encephalopathy in 1 (1 of 35, 2.9%) patient. Lower respiratory symptoms were not observed in 8 patients. In a patient with encephalopathy, brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed transient changes in white matter, suggesting cytotoxic edema as the mechanism underlying encephalopathy. Most patients recovered with general management, and progression to epilepsy was noted in only 1 patient. Conclusion: Although febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure associated with RSV infection, the propor tion of patients with complex febrile seizures was higher than that of those with general febrile seizures. Transient cytotoxic edema may be a pathogenic mechanism in RSV-related encephalopathy with seizures.","The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory tract infection in young children. The common respiratory manifestations are bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and croup. By the age of 2 years, approximately 90% children are infected by RSV, and approximately 45% of the RSV-related hospital admissions occur in children younger than 6 months. 1, 2) As in other common viral infections, RSV may be associated with neurological manifestations, including seizures, encephalopathy, extraocular movement disorder, and central apnea. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Although the pathogenesis of the neurologic complications are not fully understood, the possible contributions of immune-related cytokine responses, less well-proven direct invasion of virus particles, and brain stem-related mechanisms for respiratory control have been recognized. 3, 5, [9] [10] [11] caused by factors other than RSV infections, and those with epilepsy were excluded. In this study, a simple febrile seizure was defined as a seizure occurring during a febrile illness and not caused by an acute disease of the nervous system in children aged between 6 months and 5 years. 18) The seizure should be generalized and short (duration less than 15 minutes) and not recur within 24 hours. Complex febrile seizure was defined as a 1) focal, 2) generalized, and prolonged seizure lasting more than 15 minutes and recurring with 24 hours, or 3) postictal neurological abnormalities, such as Todd's palsy. 18) This study was performed in a regional hospital in Guri, a city located in the metropolitan area around Seoul. All research protocols were ap proved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Hanyang University Guri Hospital (approval number: 2017-12-014). Informed consent was exempted by the IRB."
The Battle Between Influenza and the Innate Immune Response in the Human Respiratory Tract,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory tract. Infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract but certain viral strains have evolved the ability to infect the lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, leading to inflammation and a disease pattern of diffuse alveolar damage. Factors leading to this sequence of events are novel influenza strains, or strains that have viral proteins, in particular the NS1 protein that allow it to escape the innate immune system. There are three main barriers that prevent infection of pneumocytes -mucin, host defence lectins and cells such as macrophages. Viruses have developed strategies such as neuraminidase and glycosylation patterns that allow this evasion. Though there has been much investment in antiviral drugs, it is proposed that more attention should be directed towards developing or utilizing compounds that enhance the ability of the innate immune system to combat viral infection.","1918 was not a good year. Europe was not only in the final throes of a war that had extracted a heavy economic and physical burden on society with a tremendous loss of life. There was also the emergence of a new form of respiratory infection that was resulting in a 2-8% mortality. Doctors in Europe and the United States were battling to comprehend this emerging infection that had spread around military barracks and into the population with a transmission from humans to humans that had not been seen before. Researchers in the United States and United Kingdom examined the lungs of young soldiers who had died within a few days of contacting the disease. They found that the changes in the lungs were typified by the appearance of ""… a non-cellular homogeneous exudate which was eosinophilic, and this was thought to be due to the presence of albumin coming from the serum…"" The only comparison that this disease could be compared with was in the poisoning due to chlorine gas [1] ."
Correspondence to,"Asthma is a common disorder of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and by decline in lung function and airway remodeling in a subset of asthmatics. Airway remodeling is characterized by structural changes which include airway smooth muscle hypertrophy/ hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis due to thickening of the reticular basement membrane, mucus metaplasia of the epithelium, and angiogenesis. Epidemiologic studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to decline in lung function and airway remodeling in a subset of asthmatics. Environmental factors include respiratory viral infection-triggered asthma exacerbations, and tobacco smoke. There is also evidence that several asthma candidate genes may contribute to decline in lung function, including ADAM33, PLAUR, VEGF, IL13, CHI3L1, TSLP, GSDMB, TGFB1, POSTN, ESR1 and ARG2. In addition, mediators or cytokines, including cysteinyl leukotrienes, matrix metallopeptidase-9, interleukin-33 and eosinophil expression of transforming growth factor-β, may contribute to airway remodeling in asthma. Although increased airway smooth muscle is associated with reduced lung function (i.e. forced expiratory volume in 1 second) in asthma, there have been few long-term studies to determine how individual pathologic features of airway remodeling contribute to decline in lung function in asthma. Clinical studies with inhibitors of individual gene products, cytokines or mediators are needed in asthmatic patients to identify their individual role in decline in lung function and/or airway remodeling.","Asthma is a common disorder of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and in a subset of asthmatics by decline in lung function and airway remodeling.

Follow-up monitoring in a cat with leishmaniosis and coinfections with Hepatozoon felis and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum',"Case summary A 6-year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat from Cyprus was presented with multiple ulcerated skin nodules. Cytology and histopathology of the lesions revealed granulomatous dermatitis with intracytoplasmic organisms, consistent with amastigotes of Leishmania species. Biochemistry identified a mild hyperproteinaemia. Blood extraction and PCR detected Leishmania species, Hepatozoon species and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (CMhm) DNA. Subsequent sequencing identified Hepatozoon felis. Additionally, the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 locus of Leishmania infantum was partially sequenced and phylogeny showed it to cluster with species derived from dogs in Italy and Uzbekistan, and a human in France. Allopurinol treatment was administered for 6 months. Clinical signs resolved in the second month of treatment with no deterioration 8 months post-treatment cessation. Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to monitor L infantum blood DNA and antibody levels. The cat had high L infantum DNA levels pretreatment that gradually declined during treatment but increased 8 months post-treatment cessation. Similarly, ELISA revealed high levels of antibodies pretreatment, which gradually declined during treatment and increased slightly 8 months post-treatment cessation. The cat remained PCR positive for CMhm and Hepatozoon species throughout the study. There was no clinical evidence of relapse 24 months post-treatment. Relevance and novel information To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of a cat with leishmaniosis with H felis and CMhm coinfections. The high L infantum DNA levels post-treatment cessation might indicate that although the lesions had resolved, prolonged or an alternative treatment could have been considered.","Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of canine leishmaniosis in Europe and a zoonotic vector-borne pathogen, has been increasingly reported in cats in the Mediterranean basin, providing mounting evidence that cats may act as a secondary reservoir. 1 Experimental and case-control studies on feline leishmaniosis (FeL) are lacking, limiting our knowledge of this disease; thus epidemiological studies, case series and case descriptions are required to establish a better understanding of the clinicopathological presentations, treatment, monitoring and prevention of FeL. 2 Herein, we describe the clinical, laboratory and molecular findings, as well as treatment and prolonged monitoring data, from an adult domestic shorthair cat from Cyprus diagnosed with leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum and coinfections with Hepatozoon felis and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (CMhm)."
Potential for global spread of a novel coronavirus from China,"An epidemic of a novel coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 and has since spread to several large Chinese cities. Should a scenario arise where this coronavirus spreads more broadly across China, we evaluate how patterns of international disease transmission could change.","A novel coronavirus emerging from Wuhan, China in late December 2019 is currently spreading to other provinces in mainland China and international destinations across East Asia. At the time of writing, cases have been confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau and multiple cities in Guangdong province, with more than 500 cases confirmed across China. 1 Furthermore, several cases have spread internationally via air travel 2 to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. A recent modelling study concluded that for these international exportations to be observed, the outbreak in China should be substantially larger than is reflected by confirmed case counts. 3 Currently, many public health interventions are based on scenarios where Wuhan is the primary source of new cases. 4 While there are currently no documented transmission chains outside of the Wuhan region, should a scenario arise where this novel coronavirus spreads more broadly to and within other Chinese cities, we evaluated how global patterns of disease dispersion might change."
Two Separate Signals Act Independently to Localize a Yeast Late Golgi Membrane Protein through a Combination of Retrieval and Retention,The localization of proteins to late-Golgi,"membranes (TGN) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is conferred by targeting motifs containing aromatic residues in the cytosolic domains of these proteins. These signals could act by directing retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment or by preventing exit from the TGN. To investigate the mechanism of localization of yeast TGN proteins, we used the heterologous protein A-ALP (consisting of the cytosolic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A [DPAP A] fused to the transmembrane and luminal domains of the vacuolar protein alkaline phosphatase [ALP] ), which localizes to the yeast TGN. Insertion of the aromatic residue-based TGN localization motif (FXFXD) of DPAP A into the cytosolic domain of ALP results in a protein that resides in the TGN. We demonstrate that the FXFXD motif confers Golgi localization through retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment by detecting a post-Golgi processed form of this protein in the TGN. We present an assay that uncouples retrieval-mediated Golgi localization from static retention-based localization, allowing measurement of the rate at which proteins exit the yeast TGN. We also demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of DPAP A contains additional information, separate from the retrieval motif, that slows exit from the TGN. We propose a model for DPAP A localization that involves two distinct mechanisms: one in which the FXFXD motif directs retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment, and a second that slows the rate at which DPAP A exits the TGN."
Low-fidelity Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus polymerase mutants to improve live-attenuated vaccine safety and efficacy,"During RNA virus replication, there is the potential to incorporate mutations that affect virulence or pathogenesis. For liveattenuated vaccines, this has implications for stability, as replication may result in mutations that either restore the wildtype phenotype via reversion or compensate for the attenuating mutations by increasing virulence (pseudoreversion). Recent studies have demonstrated that altering the mutation rate of an RNA virus is an effective attenuation tool. To validate the safety of low-fidelity mutations to increase vaccine attenuation, several mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) were tested in the live-attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine strain, TC-83. Next generation sequencing after passage in the presence of mutagens revealed a mutant containing three mutations in the RdRp, TC-83 3x, to have decreased replication fidelity, while a second mutant, TC-83 4x displayed no change in fidelity, but shared many phenotypic characteristics with TC-83 3x. Both mutants exhibited increased, albeit inconsistent attenuation in an infant mouse model, as well as increased immunogenicity and complete protection against lethal challenge of an adult murine model compared with the parent TC-83. During serial passaging in a highly permissive model, the mutants increased in virulence but remained less virulent than the parent TC-83. These results suggest that the incorporation of low-fidelity mutations into the RdRp of live-attenuated vaccines for RNA viruses can confer increased immunogenicity whilst showing some evidence of increased attenuation. However, while in theory such constructs may result in more effective vaccines, the instability of the vaccine phenotype decreases the likelihood of this being an effective vaccine strategy.","Due to the error-prone nature of the RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (RdRp), RNA virus replication is characterized by a high mutation rate that results in increased genetic diversity of progeny viruses (Domingo et al. 2005) . This diversity can be utilized by the virus to evade and escape the immune system, as well as to adapt to new hosts. Maintaining the correct amount of virus diversity of $1 mutation per genome (Nebot et al. 2010) is of utmost importance to RNA virus survival within the host and during transmission. This is especially true for arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses), which utilize two distinct hosts to complete their transmission cycle. If the mutation rate of an RNA virus is too high, more unfit progeny will be produced due to the increased number of mutations, most of which are deleterious by chance. This results in a substantial decrease in viable genomes, and possible extinction of the viral population due to error catastrophe (Manrubia et al. 2010) . Conversely, if the mutation rate is too low, little variation is produced, and the virus population becomes clonal and less able to adapt to diverse environments. Both scenarios reduce the overall fitness of the virus and can lead to extinction (Escarmís et al. 2008 ). This predicted lack of fitness with high-or low-fidelity replication has been demonstrated experimentally with a number of viruses, including poliovirus (PV) (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003; Vignuzzi et al. 2006) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Coffey et al. 2011; Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014 ), West Nile virus (Van Slyke et al. 2015) , St Louis encephalitis virus (Griesemer et al. 2017) , human enterovirus 71 (Sadeghipour and McMinn 2013; Sadeghipour et al. 2013; Meng and Kwang 2014) , foot and mouth disease virus (Arias et al. 2008; Zeng et al. 2013 Zeng et al. , 2014 Xie et al. 2014) , SARS CoV (Eckerle et al. 2010; Graham et al. 2012; Graepel et al. 2017) , influenza virus (Cheung et al. 2014; Pauly et al. 2017) , Norovirus (Arias et al. 2016) and Coxsackie B virus (Gnä dig et al. 2012; Levi et al. 2010; McDonald et al. 2016) . These viruses were all subjected to treatment with nucleoside analogs such as Ribavirin or 5'Fluorouracil, which increases the mutation rate and can lead to virus extinction, or by the insertion of mutations found to change fidelity in other viruses. Virus populations circumvent extinction by developing resistance to the nucleoside analog, sometimes by developing mutations in the RdRp that either increase (high fidelity) or decrease (low fidelity/hypermutator) RdRp fidelity (i.e. the RdRp error-rate). When compared with unpassaged, wild-type (wt) viruses, fidelity mutants have similar growth kinetics in vitro, but are attenuated in vivo due to the alteration of diversity produced during replication, which hampers the ability of the virus to overcome bottlenecks in the host (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2005; Vignuzzi et al. 2006) ."
The Singapore Field Epidemiology Service: Insights Into Outbreak Management,"Field epidemiology involves the implementation of quick and targeted public health interventions with the aid of epidemiological methods. In this article, we share our practical experiences in outbreak management and in safeguarding the population against novel diseases. Given that cities represent the financial nexuses of the global economy, global health security necessitates the safeguard of cities against epidemic diseases. Singapore's public health landscape has undergone a systemic and irreversible shift with global connectivity, rapid urbanization, ecological change, increased affluence, as well as shifting demographic patterns over the past two decades. Concomitantly, the threat of epidemics, ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A (H1N1) to the resurgence of vector-borne diseases as well as the rise of modern lifestyle-related outbreaks, have worsened difficulties in safeguarding public health amidst much elusiveness and unpredictability. One critical factor that has helped the country overcome these innate and man-made public health vulnerabilities is the development of a resilient field epidemiology service, which includes our enhancement of surveillance and response capacities for outbreak management, and investment in public health leadership. We offer herein the Singapore story as a case study in meeting the challenges of disease control in our modern built environment.","Field epidemiology involves the application of epidemiological methods to often unexpected public health events where rapid on-site investigations and timely interventions are necessary. With global transformations in politics, economics and culture, the health of populations is increasingly more vulnerable to the threat of epidemics. From emerging and re- Certainly, the epidemic spread of diseases is not a novel phenomenon. But until the first International Sanitary Conference in 1851 and its serial meetings, there were few mechanisms that facilitated international cooperation among countries [1] . The long time span between the inaugural conference and the subsequent institutionalisation of a common framework suggest the difficulties and sensitivities involved in facilitating international cooperation on epidemic disease control [2] . Yet, that countries remain concerned with, and are willing to cooperate on the cross-border transmission of disease, indicates a rationale far surpassing historical continuity or obliga-tory duty. A seemingly archaic and oft-overlooked reason is that disease epidemics have vast implications on national survival, and that the health of the domestic population provides countries with the assurance and freedom to pursue its vision and goals."
The evolutionary significance of depression in Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D),"Given the manifold ways that depression impairs Darwinian fitness, the persistence in the human genome of risk alleles for the disorder remains a much debated mystery. Evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning, whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations. These limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles. Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection. Depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment. Moreover, data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia, reduced bodily iron stores, conservation/withdrawal behavior, hypervigilance and anorexia. By shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world, the Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm, whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function.","Major depression is so detrimental to survival and reproduction that it is hard to understand why allelic variants that promote the disorder have not been culled from the human genome, why in fact-far from being culled-genes that promote depression are so common and numerous and appear to have actually increased in prevalence during recent human evolution. 1 To address this issue, we have developed a novel theoretical framework positing that risk alleles for depression originated and have been largely retained in the human genome because these alleles encode for an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses that promote host defense against pathogens. This enhanced pathogen defense is accomplished primarily via heightened innate immune system activation, which results in reduced death from infectious causes, 2-5 especially in infancy when selection pressure from infection is strongest, 6 and the adaptive immune system is not yet fully operational. [6] [7] [8] [9] A vast literature has associated depressive symptoms and/or major depressive disorder (MDD) with increased innate immune inflammatory responses, 10 with meta-analyses reporting the most consistent findings for increased plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein and haptoglobin. [11] [12] [13] Recent longitudinal studies extend these cross-sectional observations by reporting that increased inflammatory markers in nondepressed individuals predict the later development of depression. [14] [15] [16] Because infection has been the primary cause of early mortality and hence reproductive failure across human evolution, 9, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] it would be expected that if depressive symptoms were an integral part of a heightened immunological response, allelic variants that support this response would have undergone strong positive selection pressure and thus would be both numerous and prevalent, as they appear to be. However, because the survival benefits of inflammatory processes are tempered by their costs in terms of increased mortality from septic shock, 22, 23 pathogen manipulation, 21, 24 long-term tissue damage and chronic disease, 10 these alleles would not be predicted to go to fixation (that is, 100% prevalence) but would be expected to manifest an intermediate prevalence reflecting the benefit of enhanced host defense in any given environment minus attendant costs. Again, this is consistent with current findings in the genetics of depression."
S-layers: principles and applications,"Monomolecular arrays of protein or glycoprotein subunits forming surface layers (S-layers) are one of the most commonly observed prokaryotic cell envelope components. S-layers are generally the most abundantly expressed proteins, have been observed in species of nearly every taxonomical group of walled bacteria, and represent an almost universal feature of archaeal envelopes. The isoporous lattices completely covering the cell surface provide organisms with various selection advantages including functioning as protective coats, molecular sieves and ion traps, as structures involved in surface recognition and cell adhesion, and as antifouling layers. S-layers are also identified to contribute to virulence when present as a structural component of pathogens. In Archaea, most of which possess S-layers as exclusive wall component, they are involved in determining cell shape and cell division. Studies on structure, chemistry, genetics, assembly, function, and evolutionary relationship of S-layers revealed considerable application potential in (nano)biotechnology, biomimetics, biomedicine, and synthetic biology.","With the exception of those prokaryotic organisms which have developed strategies to live under very specialized and frequently extreme environmental conditions in which monocultures are feasible, most organisms have to survive in highly competitive habitats in very complex microbiomes. Consequently, the diversity observed in the molecular architecture of bacterial and archaeal cell envelopes, particularly the structure of the outermost boundary layers, reflects evolutionary adaptations of the organism to specific environmental and ecological conditions. Among the most commonly observed prokaryotic cell surface structures are two-dimensional arrays of proteinaceous subunits forming surface layers (termed S-layers) on prokaryotic cells (Sleytr, 1976; Sleytr et al., 1988b ; Table 1 ). Since the first 'macromolecular monolayer' described by Houwink and Le Poole (1952; Houwink, 1953) in the cell wall of a Spirillum sp., S-layers have now been identified in hundreds of different species of almost every taxonomic group of walled Bacteria and are an almost universal feature of Archaea ( Fig. 1 ; for compila-tion see, Sleytr et al., 1996a Sleytr et al., , 2002 Claus et al., 2005; K€ onig et al., 2010; Messner et al., 2010; Albers & Meyer, 2011; Hynonen & Palva, 2013) ."
Th17 profile in COPD exacerbations,"COPD is characterized by an ongoing inflammatory process of the airways that leads to obstruction or limitation of airflow. It is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. In addition, it is considered, at present, a serious public health problem, ranking fourth in mortality worldwide. Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Neutrophil migration to the inflammation area could be mediated largely by cytokines related to CD4+ Th17 lymphocytes, because it has been shown that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 act as inducers for CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF secretion by epithelial cells of the airways. The aims of these molecules are differentiation, proliferation and recruitment of neutrophils. Furthermore, it is believed that CD4+ lymphocytes Th17 may be involved in protection against pathogens for which Th1 and Th2 are not prepared to fight. In COPD exacerbations, there is an increased cellularity in the lung region and respiratory tract. Therefore, the increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the airways and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines are directly related to the severity of exacerbations and that is the importance of the functions of Th17 profile in this entity.","COPD is characterized by a continuous inflammatory process of the airways, leading to obstruction or limitation of airflow, which is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. 1, 2 However, only 10%-20% of smokers will develop the disease at some day in their life. These data lead to the belief that this disease is due to multiple factors that interact with each other. Among the most prominent are genetic factors that can condition patients to have a certain susceptibility to COPD. For example, deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) (responsible for inhibiting proteases, whose function is to deplete the extracellular matrix) is present in at least 1% of the carriers of the disease in Europe and the United States and other regions around the world such as Africa and Australia. 3 Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and the chemical mediators they produce (cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, growth factors, etc.). For example, neutrophil elastase (NE) is an enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix to facilitate the migration of the neutrophil through the lung parenchyma to the inflammation area. People harboring AAT deficiency alleles have a greater susceptibility to presenting the disease or presenting it at an earlier age. 1, 4 On the other hand, cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL8 (also called IL-8), IL-22, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17F and TGF-β among others are increased in samples from patients with COPD, suggesting an important role in its pathophysiology and in the exacerbations that may occur due Epidemiology COPD is now considered a serious public health problem, reaching the fourth place in mortality worldwide and in Mexico as well. 6, 7 Globally, this disease is present in ~600 million of people, especially in low-and middle-income countries. It is estimated that in 2020, it will rank among the first three causes of death worldwide. 8 COPD and asthma are the airway obstructive pathologies more prevalent. 9"
Mice Lacking Expression of Secondary Lymphoid Organ Chemokine Have Defects in Lymphocyte Homing and Dendritic Cell Localization,"Secondary lymphoid organ chemokine (SLC) is expressed in high endothelial venules and in T cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes (LNs) and strongly attracts naive T cells. In mice homozygous for the paucity of lymph node T cell ( plt ) mutation, naive T cells fail to home to LNs or the lymphoid regions of spleen. Here we demonstrate that expression of SLC is undetectable in plt mice. In addition to the defect in T cell homing, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) fail to accumulate in spleen and LN T cell zones of plt mice. DC migration to LNs after contact sensitization is also substantially reduced. The physiologic significance of these abnormalities in plt mice is indicated by a markedly increased sensitivity to infection with murine hepatitis virus. The plt mutation maps to the SLC locus; however, the sequence of SLC introns and exons in plt mice is normal. These findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC mediates the entry of naive T cells and antigen-stimulated DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.","S econdary lymphoid organs are the predominant site of lymphocyte sensitization to novel antigens. Their function requires the colocalization of two distinct populations of leukocytes: antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) 1 and antigen-responsive naive lymphocytes (1) . Chemokines, a rapidly growing family of small chemotactic cytokines, are believed to provide the signals that guide leukocytes to their proper location within lymphoid organs (2, 3) . Several recently identified chemokines have been suggested to mediate the constitutive trafficking of leukocytes based on their in vitro characteristics and their expression in lymphoid tissues (4) . A role for chemokines in B cell localization was shown by a targeted disruption of the chemokine receptor Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, the involvement of chemokines in the localization of either T cells or DCs within lymphoid organs has not been directly demonstrated."
IgY antibodies for the immunoprophylaxis and therapy of respiratory infections,"Emergence of drug resistance among the causative organisms for respiratory tract infections represents a critical challenge to the global health care community. Further, although vaccination can prevent disease, vaccine development is impeded by several factors. Therefore, novel approaches to treat and manage respiratory infections are urgently needed. Passive immunization represents a possible alternative to meet this need. Immunoglobulin Y antibodies (IgYs) from the yolk of chicken eggs have previously been used against bacterial and viral infections in human and animals. Their advantages include lack of reaction with mammalian Fc receptors, low production cost, and ease of extraction. Compared to mammalian IgGs, they have higher target specificity and greater binding avidity. They also possess remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity in the respiratory tract and lungs. In this review, we provide an overview of avian IgYs and describe their potential therapeutic applications for the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections.","Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) represent one of the most common illnesses encountered in clinical medicine. In developed countries, RTIs account for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions, more than 30% of lost work-days, and 20% of all medical consultations. 1 About 1.3 million children under 5 years die from acute respiratory infections (ARI) worldwide every year 2 and represents the cause of death in one third of children under five years in developing countries. 3 Multidrug-resistant (MDR) or difficult-to-treat pathogens are an enormous challenge to the global health care community because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with them as well as the economic burden that they place on patients and the health care system. Antibiotics are a major tool in managing infections caused by these pathogens, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] but the emergence of antibiotic resistance has undermined their usefulness in some cases. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of respiratory infections are acute viral infections. The management of such infections includes use of antivirals and treatment to relieve disease symptoms. However, most antiviral agents target conserved viral proteins, which places selective pressure on the virus, leading to the development of antiviral resistance. 9 Viral infections can be prevented by vaccination, but vaccine development faces multiple challenges, including antigenic variations in viral strains, low efficacy or short-term immune responses. In the case of outbreaks, rapid vaccine development may not be possible to control the spread of infection. 10 Therefore, an urgent need exists to develop novel approaches to treat and manage the respiratory infections Passive immunization offers an alternative approach for treating infections in immune-compromised individuals and avoiding any side effects that might result from vaccination. 11 Antibody preparations used for passive immunization mainly contain polyclonal antibodies derived from the sera of immunized animals, immunized humans, and in some cases convalescing patients. 12, 13 The effective use of polyclonal antibodies faces several challenges, including standardization and patient safety. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been suggested as an alternative to polyclonal antibodies, but their use is limited by high production cost (about US$100/g). 14 In addition, the possibility of viral escape mutants requires production of numerous mAbs targeting several antigens. This strategy would increase the cost and require additional efficacy and safety studies. 15 Immunoglobulin (Ig)Ys are produced by chickens and other birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The function of IgYs is similar to that of mammalian IgGs. 16 IgYs are present in the sera of chickens and are passed to the embryo through egg yolk. 17 Egg IgY antibodies have previously been used against bacterial 18 and viral infections. 19 IgY is well tolerated because chicken eggs are a natural part of the human diet. In addition, it can be used in patients with egg allergies because the purified IgY does not contain egg albumin, the common trigger for allergic reactions to eggs. 20 Moreover, the immunogenicity of IgY has been tested previously in both pigs and mice. Vega et al 21 and Torche et al 22 have both demonstrated that administration of IgY to pigs via both systemic and local routes induced an anti-IgY antibody response, primarily consisting of the IgG subclass. These data suggest that IgY is antigenic and although the biochemical properties of this antibody molecule do not facilitate considerable binding to mammalian Fc receptors, serum sickness is a theoretical possibility if IgY is administered in large amounts. Whether or not IgY elicits an allergic response in pigs is unknown, however Akita et al 23 demonstrated that administration of egg yolk containing IgY, purified IgY, and IgY Fab' to mice failed to induce an IgE response. They further determined that there was very little cross reactivity between egg white protein, which is highly allergenic, and purified IgY."
Reovirus Activates a Caspase-Independent Cell Death Pathway,"Virus-induced apoptosis is thought to be the primary mechanism of cell death following reovirus infection. Induction of cell death following reovirus infection is initiated by the incoming viral capsid proteins during cell entry and occurs via NF-B-dependent activation of classical apoptotic pathways. Prototype reovirus strain T3D displays a higher cell-killing potential than strain T1L. To investigate how signaling pathways initiated by T3D and T1L differ, we methodically analyzed cell death pathways activated by these two viruses in L929 cells. We found that T3D activates NF-B, initiator caspases, and effector caspases to a significantly greater extent than T1L. Surprisingly, blockade of NF-B or caspases did not affect T3D-induced cell death. Cell death following T3D infection resulted in a reduction in cellular ATP levels and was sensitive to inhibition of the kinase activity of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.","tutes an intrinsic response of the host cell to viral infection (1, 2) . Though both apoptosis and necrosis function to limit viral infection, they each have markedly different effects on the cell. While apoptosis results in membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation, the integrity of the plasma membrane is maintained (3) . In contrast, necrosis results in cell rounding, cell swelling, and ultimately a loss of plasma membrane integrity, leading to the leakage of host cytoplasmic contents (3) . In addition to the morphological differences in dying cells, apoptosis and necrosis also influence host physiology in a distinct manner. While cells dying by apoptosis do not activate the immune system, the leakiness of necrotic cells recruits immune cells and promotes inflammation (4), potentially enhancing pathology associated with cell death. Though necrosis was generally considered to be an unregulated, uncontrolled form of cell death, recent evidence indicates that at least one form of necrosis, necroptosis, is programmed (5) . In addition to the leakiness of membranes observed in all forms of necrosis, necroptosis is characterized by the activation of signaling from death receptors, the dispensability of caspase activity, and a requirement for the kinase activity of recep-tor interacting protein 1 (RIP1 or RIPK1) or 3 (RIP3 or RIPK3) (3) . Though both apoptosis and necroptosis have been shown to occur during viral infection, it is not known if similar events in viral infection trigger apoptosis and necroptosis (1) . Conditions that favor one form of cell death over the other during viral infection are also not understood."
Rapid Multiplex Testing for Upper Respiratory Pathogens in the Emergency Department: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Background. Acute upper respiratory tract infections are a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits and often result in unnecessary antibiotic treatment.,"Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for ~12.6 million cases annually from 2001 to 2010 [1] . Many of these cases are due to viral infection, and up to 30%-40% are prescribed antibiotics inappropriately [2] . This is worrisome, as overuse of antibiotics creates selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant pathogens that increases morbidity, mortality, and health care cost for affected patients [3] . In addition, antibiotic use can lead to drug-related adverse reactions that could prompt patients to return to the ED [3, 4] ."
Pediatric Drug Nitazoxanide: A Potential Choice for Control of Zika,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can be the cause of congenital malformations, including microcephaly in infants and can cause other disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis, which can also occur in some infected adults. However, at this time, there is no drug approved to treat ZIKV infection. Drug repurposing is the promptest way to obtain an effective drug during a global public health emergency such as the spread of Zika virus. In this study, we report a US Food and Drug Admistration-approved drug that is safe for pediatric use. Nitazoxanide and its bioactive metabolite, tizoxanide, have anti-ZIKV potential in vitro, and we identified that they exerts antiviral effect possibly by targeting the viral postattachment step.","Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first isolated in Uganda in 1947, has a positive-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome of approximately 11 000 nucleotides. Zika virus can be transmitted by Aedes spp mosquitoes and also through sexual contact, blood transfusion, urine, saliva, and vertically from mother to fetus [1] . Since a large Zika outbreak happened in Brazil in 2014, ZIKV transmission has been reported in more than 60 countries and regions globally. Although 80% of patients infected with ZIKV are asymptomatic [2] , it can lead to fetal microcephaly in pregnant women [3] , and it may increase risk of neurological disorders and myelitis in infected adults [4] . The association between ZIKV infection and testis damage was proved in a mouse model recently, arising the concern between ZIKV infection and infertility in male [5] . To protect the public health, especially to avoid birth defects, it is necessary to find a safe drug that can be taken by mouth (orally) for prophylactic and therapeutic use during an epidemic."
Amino acid residues critical for RNA-binding in the N-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid protein are essential determinants for the infectivity of coronavirus in cultured cells,"The N-terminal domain of the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein adopts a fold resembling a right hand with a flexible, positively charged b-hairpin and a hydrophobic palm. This domain was shown to interact with the genomic RNA for coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based on its 3D structure, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues essential for the RNA-binding activity of the IBV N protein and viral infectivity. Alanine substitution of either Arg-76 or Tyr-94 in the N-terminal domain of IBV N protein led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding activity and a total loss of the infectivity of the viral RNA to Vero cells. In contrast, mutation of amino acid Gln-74 to an alanine, which does not affect the binding activity of the N-terminal domain, showed minimal, if any, detrimental effect on the infectivity of IBV. This study thus identifies residues critical for RNA binding on the nucleocapsid surface, and presents biochemical and genetic evidence that directly links the RNA binding capacity of the coronavirus N protein to the viral infectivity in cultured cells. This information would be useful in development of preventive and treatment approaches against coronavirus infection.","RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, encode a group of structural phosphoproteins with basic patches on their surface. As a pivotal structural component of the virion, this group of proteins plays essential roles in packaging the RNA genome to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex resulting from assembly of the viral RNA and multiple copies of the (nucleo)capsid protein. A detailed dissection and characterization of the intrinsic RNA-binding properties of these proteins are thus essential for understanding several important processes in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including assembly of the nucleocapsid, the specific encapsidation of viral RNA and morphogenesis of virions. In this study, amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of a coronavirus that are critical for its RNA-binding activity are identified and their roles in viral infectivity are analyzed, using site-directed mutagenesis based on our previous structural studies."
Hepatitis E Virus-Associated Meningoencephalitis in a Lung Transplant Recipient Diagnosed by Clinical Metagenomic Sequencing,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection uncommonly causes chronic hepatitis and neurologic disease. We describe a case of genotype 3a HEV meningoencephalitis diagnosed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing, illustrating the power of an unbiased molecular approach to microbial testing and the first reported case of HEV infection presumably acquired through lung transplantation.","The Precision Diagnosis of Acute Infectious Diseases (PDAID) study for the diagnosis of hospitalized patients with suspected infectious causes of meningoencephalitis was launched in June 2016. The goal of this multihospital, nationwide study is to evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of a clinical metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay for pathogen detection as compared with conventional microbiological testing (Supplementary Methods). The mNGS approach does not define targets a priori; rather, any and all viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are identified in clinical samples on the basis of sequence homology to GenBank microbial reference databases. The mNGS assay has been validated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory [4, 5] , and results are relayed to the treating clinical team(s) and reported in the patient's electronic medical record."
Identification and molecular characterisation of bovine parainfluenza virus-3 and bovine respiratory syncytial virus -first report from Turkey,"Introduction: Bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV3) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are the cause of respiratory disease in cattle worldwide. With other pathogens, they cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in ruminants. The aim of the study was the detection and molecular characterisation of BPIV3 and BRSV from nasal swabs and lung samples of cows in and around the Erzurum region of eastern Turkey. Material and Methods: In total, 155 samples were collected. Of animals used in the study 92 were males and 63 females. The age of the animals was between 9 months and 5 years, mean 1.4 years. Most males were in the fattening period and being raised in open sheds; females were in the lactating period and kept in free stall barns. All samples were tested for the presence of viral genes using RT-PCR. Genespecific primers in a molecular method (RT-PCR) identified BRSV (fusion gene) and BPIV3 (matrix gene) strains at the genus level. Results: RNA from BRSV and BPIV3 was detected in two (1.29%) and three (1.93%) samples, respectively, one of each of which was sequenced and the sequences were aligned with reference virus strains. Phylogenetic analyses clustered the strains in genotype C/BPIV3 and subgroup III/BRSV. Conclusion: The results indicate that BRSV and BPIV3 contribute to bovine respiratory disease cases in Turkey. This is the first report on their detection and molecular characterisation in ruminants in Turkey.","Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a major problem for cattle breeders worldwide, causing serious economic losses. BRDC is associated with infection by certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites (33) . In addition to these infectious agents, stress factors such as transport, gestation, and poor management conditions play an important role in the onset of the disease (30) . Bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV3) are the most common viral agents of the respiratory system. Some opportunistic agents (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus, and Mycoplasma spp.) contribute to the appearance of clinical signs and thus increase mortality and cause losses in the herds (18) . Suppressed immunity also has an important role in the prognosis. Diseases such as bovine leucosis and bovine viral diarrhoea suppress immunity and lead to more animal loss by worsening clinical symptoms."

Several factors increase the risk of metabolic and chronic diseases in the Saudi Arabian population. 2 Cardiovascular ailments are at the top of the list of diseases causing highest number of mortality in Saudi Arabia. 3 Among this, ischemic heart disease accounts for 14% and stroke accounts for 11% of the total casualties in 2010. 3 Saudi Arabia provides free health-care services to its citizens. The government of Saudi Arabia in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized on improving the health situation in the country by focusing on 5 key health issues; namely, 1) health security and disease prevention, 2) control of communicable diseases, 3) control of non-communicable diseases, 4) accidents and injuries, and 5) strengthening of health systems, on a priority basis. 1 Cases of some infectious diseases were recently identified in Saudi Arabia, indicating that despite technological developments in diagnostics, treatment, and vaccination programs, various infectious diseases have re-emerged in Saudi Arabia after a decade. 4 For instance, the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection increased in Saudi Arabia during 2012, and this disease continues to be a concern during the summer season and religious congregations in holy sites. 5 Cancers are a major health concern globally. In Saudi Arabia, the incidence of the most common cancers has increased steadily, with colorectal cancer being the most common cancer among men and breast cancer being the most common cancer among women. [6] [7] [8] The scientific information available on the current status and trends of various communicable, non-communicable diseases and cancers are limited to the primary statistics available in the portals of Ministry of Health and other health agencies. However, studies on these publicly available data regarding its analysis to derive a conclusion regarding the trends of major disease in Saudi Arabia is scanty and scattered if existed. Hence, the present study was aimed at analyzing the trends in the incidence of 5 most common cancers, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases in Saudi Arabia over the last decade."
,"Objective: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is caused by the rupture of small blood vessels and other health problems. In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared. We also analyzed the risk factors of 45 and 284 patients who did and did not experience hematoma expansion, respectively. Results: Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 (10.4%) of 67 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 38 (14.5%) of the 262 patients who did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between patients who did and did not received tranexamic acid (p=0.389). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for hematoma expansion, spot sign and a maximal diameter of 40 mm were identified as risk factors. Conclusion: We could not confirm the effect of tranexamic acid on hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Spot sign and the maximal diameter of hematomas were confirmed as risk factors of hematoma expansion. If the maximal diameter is greater than 40 mm, the hematoma should be closely monitored.","Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is caused by the rupture of small blood vessels in the brain. It is a major health problem with an annual incidence of 10-30 per 100,000 individuals and accounts for 8-30% of total strokes. 23) Compared with ischemic stroke, ICH is a critical disease with 2-6 times higher mortality and morbidity. 12) According to reports, the 30-day mortality rate of ICH is 30-55% and only 12-39% of survivors have favorable functional outcomes after 6 months. 19, 24) In patients with ICH, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor that causes poor outcomes and increasing mortality. 15 ) Therefore, prevention of hematoma enlargement is the goal of conservative management. However, except strict control of blood pressure (BP), it is not know how to prevent hematoma enlargement in ICH patients. 15, 18) According to several articles, the use of anti-fibrinolytic agents has been reported to reduce blood loss during surgery and prevent hematoma expansion. 1, 8, 11, 27, 32) However, unlike these promising findings, some related randomized controlled trial have shown that antifibrinolytic agents do not affect rebleeding, neurologic deterioration, and mortality for cerebral hemorrhage. 25, 29) In consideration of these discrepancies, we analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of an anti-fibrinolytic agent."

Infection & Chemotherapy 메르스 의료기관 감염관리지침,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an acute viral respiratory illness with high mortality caused by a new strain of betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since the report of the first patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, large-scale outbreaks through hospital-acquired infection and inter-hospital transmission have been reported. Most of the patients reported in South Korea were also infected in hospital settings. Therefore, to eliminate the spread of MERS-CoV, infection prevention and control measures should be implemented with rigor. The present guideline has been drafted on the basis of the experiences of infection control in the South Korean hospitals involved in the recent MERS outbreak and on domestic and international infection prevention and control guidelines. To ensure efficient MERS-CoV infection prevention and control, care should be taken to provide comprehensive infection control measures including contact control, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, disinfection, and environmental cleaning.",2.
VirHostNet: a knowledge base for the management and the analysis of proteome-wide virus-host interaction networks,"Infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year. The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus-host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus-Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus-virus, virushost and host-host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus-virus and virus-host interactions (2671 nonredundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 nonredundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network. Public access to the VirHostNet knowledge-based system is available at","Eukaryotic cells express a large panel of proteins that coordinately participate to the cellular machinery through a highly connected and regulated network of protein-protein interactions (1) . Physical architecture of model organisms and human cellular protein networks exhibits a strong robustness against random failures, and strikingly a high sensitivity to targeted attacks on highly connected and central proteins, also called 'hubs' (2, 3) . Cellular protein network is not static and its robustness may change dynamically according to various factors like tissue and cell-line origins, signals received by cellular environment or more specifically during viral infections (4) . Replication and pathogenesis of viruses depend on a complex interplay between viral and host cellular proteins both acting through a complex network of protein-protein interactions. In order to evade the cell innate immune response and/or to favour their own replication and transmission, viruses have developed strategies to hijack central functions of the cell (5) (6) (7) . Viruses also use intra-viral, i.e. virus-virus, protein-protein interactions for virion assembly or viral egress from the cell. Accumulation of functional perturbations associated with such virus-virus and virus-host protein-protein interactions may lead to severe and complex diseases, like the development of cancers (8, 9) . From a systems biology perspective, a deeper understanding of infectious diseases may rely on an exhaustive characterization of all potential interactions occurring between proteins encoded by viruses and those expressed in infected cells (10) . Thus, integration of all protein-protein interactions into an infected cellular network, or 'infectome', is a great challenge that may provide a powerful framework for virtual modelling and analysis of viral infection."
The SARS-coronavirus nsp7+nsp8 complex is a unique multimeric RNA polymerase capable of both de novo initiation and primer extension,"Uniquely among RNA viruses, replication of the $30-kb SARS-coronavirus genome is believed to involve two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. The first is primer-dependent and associated with the 106-kDa non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), whereas the second is catalysed by the 22-kDa nsp8. This latter enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure [i.e. nsp(7+8), consisting of 8 copies of both nsps]. To better understand the implications of these structural characteristics for nsp8-driven RNA synthesis, we studied the prerequisites for the formation of the nsp(7+8) complex and its polymerase activity. We found that in particular the exposure of nsp8's natural N-terminal residue was paramount for both the protein's ability to associate with nsp7 and for boosting its RdRp activity. Moreover, this 'improved' recombinant nsp8 was capable of extending primed RNA templates, a property that had gone unnoticed thus far. The latter activity is, however, $20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12-RdRp at equal monomer concentrations. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved D/ExD/E motifs was employed to identify residues crucial for nsp(7+8) RdRp activity.","In the replicative cycle of RNA viruses, the crucially important process of RNA-templated RNA synthesis is generally performed by an RNA-synthesizing complex of viral enzymes (1, 2) . Commonly, its core subunit is a single RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that drives the production of template strands for replication, new genome molecules, and-in many RNA virus groupsalso subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. This canonical RdRp is structurally conserved among RNA viruses and widely accepted to drive catalysis of phosphodiester bond formation via a well-established reaction mechanism involving two metal ions that are coordinated by aspartate residues in its motifs A and C (3) (4) (5) ."
International Journal of Nanomedicine Dovepress Antiviral efficacy of nanoparticulate vacuolar ATPase inhibitors against influenza virus infection,"Influenza virus infections are a major public health concern worldwide. Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins. However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals. Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. Methods: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs' anti-influenza applicability. Results: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively. The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines. As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs. In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential of the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for host-targeted treatment against influenza.","Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and can be categorized into four major types: A, B, C, and D. 1,2 Influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people cause seasonal flu epidemics each year. Influenza viruses inflict millions of infection cases in human and animals every year, and effective antivirals are an essential countermeasure against the disease. Amantadine is the first synthetic compound that inhibits influenza virus replication; the compound and its derivatives inhibit matrix-2 ion channels to block the migration of H + ions into the interior of the virus particles, a process critical for virus uncoating to occur. 3 In recent years, however, influenza virus resistance to these compounds has been widely reported. 4, 5 Another class of antiviral agent is neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, which include oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. These antiviral agents inhibit viral NA activity, which plays an important role in early influenza infection of the human airway epithelium and in virus budding. 6 While oseltamivir is currently the most common commercial anti-influenza drug, resistance against NA inhibitors has been observed. 5, 7 On the contrary, several genome-wide screens have identified host factors essential for influenza virus replication. [8] [9] [10] As an alternative to the aforementioned pathogen-targeted antivirals, growing efforts are devoted to blocking or promoting host factors to fight influenza viruses. 11 By modulating host factors involved in viral replications, these host-targeted antiviral strategies may be less susceptible to strain variations and mutations as they do not exert a selective pressure on the target pathogen."
"Mannose 6-Phosphate Receptors Are Sorted from Immature Secretory Granules via Adaptor Protein AP-1, Clathrin, and Syntaxin 6-positive Vesicles","The occurrence of clathrin-coated buds on immature granules (IGs) of the regulated secretory pathway suggests that specific transmembrane proteins are sorted into these buds through interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins. By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic ␤ cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by ‫ف‬ 90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in ␤ cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595-608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrincoated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997 . Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261-1271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR-ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.","T he TGN is involved in sorting and packaging of cargo and membrane proteins into carrier vesicles for distinct anterograde transport pathways in the cell. The best understood vesicle export from the TGN involves the sorting of lysosomal enzymes. In the Golgi complex, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes acquire mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) 1 residues that are recognized by either of the two types of M6P receptor (MPR), the cation-dependent (CD) and cation-independent (CI) MPR (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; von Figura, 1991) . Both MPRs contain cytosolically exposed information that can be recognized by adaptor protein (AP) complexes that are recruited to membranes of the TGN (Robinson and Kreis, 1992; Stamnes and Rothman, 1993; Traub et al., 1993; Le Borgne et al., 1996) , thereby initiating formation of a clathrin coat (Le Borgne and Hoflack, 1997) . The subsequently formed clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) mediate the delivery of MPR-enzyme complexes to endosomes (Ludwig et al., 1991; Geuze et al., 1992; Klumperman et al., 1993) . Syntaxin 6, a soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein with homology both to syntaxin 1 and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kD (SNAP-25) (Bock et al., 1996) , is thought to be incorporated into these endosome-bound vesicles and is implicated in their docking and/or fusion (Bock et al., 1997) ."

"Acute Exacerbation and Respiratory InfectionS in COPD (AERIS): protocol for a prospective, observational cohort study",Introduction: The aetiology of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains incompletely understood and strategies for treatment and prevention have not altered significantly for many years. Improved understanding of the role of respiratory pathogens in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is required and the use of molecular microbiological techniques may lead to insights into host-pathogen interactions and the development of more targeted therapeutic approaches.,"Respiratory InfectionS in COPD (AERIS) is a longitudinal epidemiological study to assess how changes in the COPD airway microbiome contribute to the incidence and severity of AECOPD. Patients with COPD aged 40-85 are followed monthly for 2 years, and reviewed within 72 h of onset of symptoms of AECOPD. Exacerbations are detected using daily electronic diary cards. Blood, sputum, nasopharyngeal and urine samples are collected at prespecified timepoints. Molecular diagnostic and typing techniques are used to describe the dynamics of airway infection during AECOPD and stable disease, and associations with clinical outcome. This study aims to refine the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology. AERIS will assess the impact of AECOPD on health-related quality of life and healthcare resource utilisation, and the possible interactions between nutritional status, infection and immune responses."
Type 1 Interferon Induction of Natural Killer Cell Gamma Interferon Production for Defense during Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection,"Natural killer (NK) cells are equipped to innately produce the cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-␥) in part because they basally express high levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). Type 1 interferons (IFNs) have the potential to activate STAT4 and promote IFN-␥ expression, but concurrent induction of elevated STAT1 negatively regulates access to the pathway. As a consequence, it has been difficult to detect type 1 IFN stimulation of NK cell IFN-␥ during viral infections in the presence of STAT1 and to understand the evolutionary advantage for maintaining the pathway. The studies reported here evaluated NK cell responses following infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the compartment handling the earliest events after infection, the peritoneal cavity. The production of type 1 IFNs, both IFN-␣ and IFN-␤, was shown to be early and of short duration, peaking at 30 h after challenge. NK cell IFN-␥ expression was detected with overlapping kinetics and required activating signals delivered through type 1 IFN receptors and STAT4. It took place under conditions of high STAT4 levels but preceded elevated STAT1 expression in NK cells. The IFN-␥ response reduced viral burdens. Interestingly, increases in STAT1 were delayed in NK cells compared to other peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. Taken together, the studies demonstrate a novel mechanism for stimulating IFN-␥ production and elucidate a biological role for type 1 IFN access to STAT4 in NK cells.","IMPORTANCE Pathways regulating the complex and sometimes paradoxical effects of cytokines are poorly understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biological consequences of type 1 interferon (IFN) exposure are shaped by modifying the concentrations of particular STATs to change access to the different signaling molecules. The results of the experiments presented conclusively demonstrate that NK cell IFN-␥ can be induced through type 1 IFN and STAT4 at the first site of infection during a period with high STAT4 but prior to induction of elevated STAT1 in the cells. The response mediates a role in viral defense. Thus, a very early pathway to and source of IFN-␥ in evolving immune responses to infections are identified by this work. The information obtained helps resolve long-standing controversies and advances the understanding of mechanisms regulating key type 1 IFN functions, in different cells and compartments and at different times of infection, for accessing biologically important functions."
Integration of Membrane Proteins into the Endoplasmic Reticulum Requires GTP,"We have examined the requirement for ribonucleotides and ribonucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis during early events in the membrane integration of two membrane proteins: the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus. Both proteins contain a single transmembrane-spanning segment but are integrated in the membrane with opposite orientations. The G protein has an amino-terminal signal sequence and a stop-transfer sequence located near the carboxy terminus. The HN glycoprotein has a single sequence near the amino terminus that functions as both a signal-sequence and a transmembrane-spanning segment. Membrane insertion was explored using a cell-free system directed by transcribed mRNAs encoding amino-terminal segments of the two proteins. Ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides were assembled, ribonucleotides were removed by gel filtration","chromatography, and the ribosomes were incubated with microsomal membranes under conditions of defined ribonucleotide content. Nascent chain insertion into the membrane required the presence of both the signal recognition particle and a functional signal recognition particle receptor. In the absence of ribonucleotides, insertion of nascent membrane proteins was not detected. GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues promoted efficient insertion, while ATP was comparatively ineffective. Surprisingly, the majority of the HN nascent chain remained ribosome associated after puromycin treatment. Ribosome-associated HN nascent chains remained competent for membrane insertion, while free HN chains were not competent. We conclude that a GTP binding protein performs an essential function during ribosome-dependent insertion of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum that is unrelated to protein synthesis. T HE integration of the vast majority of membrane proteins into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) ~ is initiated by the same protein components involved in the translocation of secretory proteins across the membrane bilayer. The signal recognition particle (SRP) was initially shown to bind specifically and with high affinity to the signal sequence of a nascent secretory polypeptide (21, 42) . In so doing, SRP performs a sorting function by differentiating between polypeptides with RER signal sequences and all other nascent polypeptides that have other cellular destinations. Membrane attachment of polyribosomes synthesizing secretory proteins is strictly dependent upon both SRP (40) and an endoplasmic reticulum-specific receptor for the SRPribosome complex (41) . This receptor is termed the SRP receptor (14, 41) or docking protein (25) . Together SRP and the SRP receptor function to target polyribosomes bearing nascent chains with RER signal sequences to translocation-1.

The recognition by SRP of both amino-terminal (i.e., transient) and internal (i.e., permanent) signal sequences is the initial event in the integration of membrane proteins with both single and multiple transmembrane-spanning segments (1, 2, 27, 34, 39, 48) ."
Intermediates in the Constitutive and Regulated Secretory Pathways Released In Vitro from Semi-intact Cells,"Regulated secretory cells have two pathways that transport secreted proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface . To identify carrier vesicles involved in regulated and constitutive secretion, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were labeled with [33S]sulfate to identify markers for the two secretory pathways, then mechanically permeabilized and incubated in vitro. Small constitutive secretory vesicles, containing mostly sulfated proteoglycans, accumulated during an in vitro incubation with ATP In the presence of M EMBRANE traffic between compartments involves carrier vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with the acceptor compartment . To explain how membrane proteins are sorted to different organelles, we need to know how the carrier vesicle selects a subset of the proteins present in the donor membrane compartment and how it fuses exclusively with the acceptor. With these questions in mind, considerable effort has been expended in identifying carrier vesicles involved in ER to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport and post-trans-Golgi","GTPyS, the constitutive vesicles became significantly more dense, suggesting that a coated intermediate was stabilized . Larger immature regulated secretory granules, enriched in sulfated secretogranin II, also escaped from the permeabilized cells in vitro. During granule maturation, their density increased and the amount of cofractionating proteoglycans diminished. The data suggest that sorting continues during secretory granule maturation ."
Aetiology of paediatric pneumonia after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on behalf of the North East of England Paediatric Respiratory Infection Study Group,We describe the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia in children before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) programme in 2006.,"The range of implicated pathogens in paediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is wide and includes viruses, bacteria and co-infection with both [1, 2] . Studies of pneumonia frequently report low levels of pathogen identification, although improved knowledge of pneumonia aetiology is essential for the development of targeted management and effective public health strategies such as vaccination [3, 4] . In the UK, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced routinely in September 2006 and replaced by PCV13 from April 2010. The vaccine schedule is three doses administered at 2, 4 and 13 months of age. When first introduced, those over and under 1 year of age received one and two doses, respectively, as part of a catch-up programme for children aged ,2 years."
Arenavirus Stable Signal Peptide Is the Keystone Subunit for Glycoprotein Complex Organization,"The rodent arenavirus glycoprotein complex encodes a stable signal peptide (SSP) that is an essential structural component of mature virions. The SSP, GP1, and GP2 subunits of the trimeric glycoprotein complex noncovalently interact to stud the surface of virions and initiate arenavirus infectivity. Nascent glycoprotein production undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events: first within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cleave SSP from the remaining precursor GP1/2 (glycoprotein complex [GPC]) glycoprotein and second within the Golgi stacks by the cellular SKI-1/S1P for GP1/2 processing to yield GP1 and GP2 subunits. Cleaved SSP is not degraded but retained as an essential glycoprotein subunit. Here, we defined functions of the 58amino-acid lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) SSP in regard to glycoprotein complex processing and maturation. Using molecular biology techniques, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry, we detected SSP at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. Further, we identified a sorting signal (FLLL) near the carboxyl terminus of SSP that is required for glycoprotein maturation and trafficking. In the absence of SSP, the glycoprotein accumulated within the ER and was unable to undergo processing by SKI-1/S1P. Mutation of this highly conserved FLLL motif showed impaired glycoprotein processing and secretory pathway trafficking, as well as defective surface expression and pH-dependent membrane fusion. Immunoprecipitation of SSP confirmed an interaction between the signal peptide and the GP2 subunit; however, mutations within this FLLL motif disrupted the association of the GP1 subunit with the remaining glycoprotein complex.","a pseudopositive-sense orientation, while the L protein and the NP are expressed in a negative-sense orientation, giving the arenaviruses an ambisense gene expression strategy (9) ."
Identification of an enterovirus recombinant with a torovirus-like gene insertion during a diarrhea outbreak in fattening pigs,"Diarrhea outbreaks in pig farms have raised major concerns in Europe and USA, as they can lead to dramatic pig losses. During a suspected outbreak in Belgium of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), we performed viral metagenomics to assess other potential viral pathogens. Although PEDV was detected, its low abundance indicated that other viruses were involved in the outbreak. Interestingly, a porcine bocavirus and several enteroviruses were most abundant in the sample. We also observed the presence of a porcine enterovirus genome with a gene insertion, resembling a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed using re-sequencing, bioinformatics, and proteomics approaches. Moreover, the predicted cleavage sites for the insertion suggest that this gene was being expressed as a single protein, rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported as a major mechanism to generate genetic diversity, but gene insertions across viral families are rather uncommon. Although such inter-family recombinations are rare, our finding suggests that these events may significantly contribute to viral evolution.","Diarrhea is an important health problem affecting piglets, as well as an important cause of production losses in fattening pigs. Typical causes of clinical and subclinical enteric problems in the latter age group are bacteria such as Brachyspira spp., Lawsonia intracellularis and/or Salmonella spp., whereas viral causes at this age are generally less common (Stå hl et al. 2011; Collins and Barchia 2014; De Ridder et al. 2014) . In a minority of cases, fattening pigs and sows can be affected by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a re-emerging enteric coronavirus (Stevenson et al. 2013; Pensaert and Martelli 2016) . Classical diagnostic methods such as specific antigen-, gene-, or antibodydetection assays are currently in use in veterinary practice in order to reach an etiological diagnosis and to put into practice targeted prophylactic and therapeutic measures. However, in recent years, a considerable progress has been made in the field of viral metagenomics, which makes it more affordable to apply next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to analyze the entire fecal viral content (the fecal virome) of a sample. Using this approach, the most frequently detected mammalian viruses in viral metagenomics studies were kobuviruses, rotaviruses, pig stool-associated ssDNA viruses, astroviruses, sapoviruses, and enteroviruses (Shan et al. 2011; Sachsenrö der et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013) ."
Epidemiology and vaccine of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China: a mini-review,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); manifestations of the disease are diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Starting from the end of 2010, a PED outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern China. Subsequently, the disease spread throughout the country and caused enormous economic losses to the pork industry. Accumulating studies demonstrated that new PEDV variants that appeared in China were responsible for the PED outbreak. In the current mini-review, we summarize PEDV epidemiology and vaccination in China.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. PEDV infections can occur in pigs of all ages, and infections are most serious in piglets, with morbidity and mortality often reaching 100% [9, 40] . Pigs that tolerate PEDV infections usually exhibit growth retardation, reduced food conversion rates, increased feeding costs and the co-occurrence of other diseases. Furthermore, PEDV infections result in reduced pig slaughter rates, insufficient pork supplies and pork price instability, because of a large number of piglet deaths."
Seroprevalence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus IgG among Healthy Young Adults in Basic Training for the Republic of Korea Air Force,"This investigation enrolled 570 healthy young males gathered from all over the country for military service at the Republic of Korea Air Force boot camp. It confirmed RSV IgG seroprevalence by utilizing the enzyme immunoassay method just prior to undergoing basic training. The mean age of this study was 20.25 ± 1.34 yr old. The results of their immunoassay seroprofiles showed that 561 men (98.4%) were positive, 2 (0.4%) were negative and 7 (1.2%) were equivocal belonging to the grey zone. It was confirmed that RSV is a common respiratory virus and RSV infection was encountered by almost all people before reaching adulthood in Korea. Nine basic trainees belonging to the RSV IgG negative and equivocal grey zone categories were prospectively observed for any particular vulnerability to respiratory infection during the training period of two months. However, these nine men completed their basic training without developing any specific respiratory illness.","Respiratory infections in the military service are the most common inflictions in the military healthcare area, yet they are problems not easy to unravel. They may cause death to military personnel often through complications, such as pneumonia and meningitis. Such events could induce a setback in the military schedule affecting military capability and sustaining an enormous loss. Immunity is easily compromised in an ambience of high physical and psychological stress, as well as the dense population of the military training camp. They cause numerous respiratory infections. The results of studies conducted up to now revealed that primary etiologic pathogens included adenoviruses, influenza A and B viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, coronavirus, and rhinoviruses, as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1) . Recent studies revealed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) would also be a significant pathogen that causes respiratory infection and an outbreak of febrile illness in the military (2, 3) ."
Public Health Emergency Response in Taiwan,"In recent years, growth of international travel and trade, as well as climate change, has resulted in the frequent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and MERS. In 2016, Taiwan used the Joint External Evaluation ( JEE) tool to evaluate its public health emergency response capacities and understand important areas for improvement. This article presents Taiwan's disaster and public health emergency response organizational structure, realtime integrated information, response processes, and command center structure. After reviewing the results of the JEE tool and drawing lessons from emergency response efforts in the United States, we provide 3 recommendations that may enhance Taiwan's public health emergency response capacities: establish common principles for disaster response regardless of which agency is in charge, standardize operation procedures, and perform regular training that includes nongovernmental organizations and a range of government departments.","L ocated on the earthquake-prone circum-Pacific belt and seasonal typhoon impact zone, Taiwan has historically been threatened by natural disasters. Taiwan is a small island with high population and urban density. Disasters in Taiwan can grow into complicated events, causing large impacts on the country's economy, environment, and public health. In 2005, the World Bank report Natural Disaster Hotspots: A Global Risk Analysis indicated that 73% of Taiwan's land and population are exposed to 3 or more hazards, such as earthquake, landslide, or flood, and almost 99% of its land and population are exposed to 2 or more hazards. 1 In fact, Taiwan may be considered one of the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards on Earth. 2 In addition, as climate change con-tinues to affect the world, extreme weather affecting Taiwan may grow worse."
Macroevolutionary immunology: a role for immunity in the diversification of animal life,"An emerging picture of the nature of immune systems across animal phyla reveals both conservatism of some features and the appearance among and within phyla of novel, lineage-specific defense solutions. The latter collectively represent a major and underappreciated form of animal diversity. Factors influencing this macroevolutionary (above the species level) pattern of novelty are considered and include adoption of different life styles, life histories, and body plans; a general advantage of being distinctive with respect to immune defenses; and the responses required to cope with parasites, many of which afflict hosts in a lineage-specific manner. This large-scale pattern of novelty implies that immunological phenomena can affect microevolutionary processes (at the population level within species) that can eventually lead to macroevolutionary events such as speciation, radiations, or extinctions. Immunologically based phenomena play a role in favoring intraspecific diversification, specialization and host specificity of parasites, and mechanisms are discussed whereby this could lead to parasite speciation. Host switching -the acquisition of new host species by parasites -is a major mechanism that drives parasite diversity and is frequently involved in disease emergence. It is also one that can be favored by reductions in immune competence of new hosts. Mechanisms involving immune phenomena favoring intraspecific diversification and speciation of host species are also discussed. A macroevolutionary perspective on immunology is invaluable in today's world, including the need to study a broader range of species with distinctive immune systems. Many of these species are faced with extinction, another macroevolutionary process influenced by immune phenomena.","Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our understanding of the diversity of immune systems across animal phyla (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010; Messier-Solek et al., 2010; Rast and Litman, 2010; this volume) . Availability of genome sequences from a broad variety of animals coupled with an increased appreciation for the diversity of their defenses has given the study of immunity a much stronger evolutionary foundation, one that has been further enriched by studies of plant immunity and responses of bacteria and archaea to threats to their genomes (Horvath and Barrangou, 2010) . The increasing depth and breadth of immunological studies is also bringing to light a greater awareness of the impact that immunity has had on all forms of life, especially parasites. Here ""parasite"" is used inclusively, referring to infectious agents ranging from viruses to bacteria to protists to multicellular helminths. The features uniting parasites are that they infect hosts, provoke some degree of fitness-diminishing harm, prompt the deployment of immune responses, and undertake immune evasive actions. ""Immune systems"" are referred to as those molecules, cells, tissues, and organs that protect hosts from parasites (see caveats below). This discussion excludes a broad range of behavioral defenses like preening (Bush and Clayton, 2006) or avoidance (e.g., Mooring et al., 2003; Garnick et al., 2010) ."
Differential Cell Count and CRP Level in Blood as Predictors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection in Acute Febrile Patients during Nosocomial Outbreak,A case-control study was performed to identify clinical predictors for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection among patients with acute febrile illness during the nosocomial outbreak. Patients with MERS-CoV were more likely to have monocytosis with normal white blood cell (WBC) count and lower C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Simple laboratory data such as complete blood counts (CBC) with differential count could be a useful marker for the prediction of MERS and triage at the initial presentation of acute febrile patients in outbreak setting.,"The Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outside the Arabian Peninsula in 2015, including 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (1, 2) . The reported data suggest that MERS-CoV is most likely to be transmitted as healthcare-associated infections and poses a serious risk for nosocomial outbreak (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . During the nosocomial outbreak of MERS, many patients were identified and quarantined by means of active surveillance. Since MERS-CoV is still a fairly new disease, there is a paucity of data regarding the characteristics of and differences between suspected patients whose tests were subsequently negative and laboratory-confirmed cases (7) . Even though potential predictors of MERS-CoV infection among patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were identified in the previous study performed in Saudi Arabia (7), information on possible predictors of infection during the nosocomial outbreak of MERS is still lacking. Therefore, we performed this study to identify possible clinical predictors which can differentiate MERS-CoV-positive patients from MERS-CoV-negative patients with acute febrile illness during the nosocomial outbreak."
Clinical usefulness of serum procalcitonin level in distinguishing between Kawasaki disease and other infections in febrile children,"Purpose: The aims of this study were to compare serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels between febrile children with Kawasaki disease (KD) and those with bacterial or viral infections, and assess the clinical usefulness of PCT level in predicting KD. Methods: Serum PCT levels were examined in febrile pediatric patients admitted between August 2013 and August 2014. The patients were divided into 3 groups as follows: 49 with KD, 111 with viral infec tions, and 24 with bacterial infections. Results: The mean PCT level in the KD group was significantly lower than that in the bacterial infection group (0.82±1.73 ng/mL vs. 3.11±6.10 ng/mL, P=0.002) and insignificantly different from that in the viral infection group (0.23±0.34 ng/mL,P=0.457). The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Creactive protein (CRP) level in the KD group were significantly higher than those in the viral and bacterial infection groups (P<0.001 and P<0.001 for ESR, P<0.001 and P=0.005 for CRP, respectively). The proportion of patients in the KD group with PCT levels of >1.0 ng/mL was significantly higher in the nonresponders to the initial intravenous immunoglobulin treatment than in the responders (36% vs. 8%, P=0.01). Conclusion: PCT levels may help to differentiate KD from bacterial infections. A combination of disease markers, including ESR, CRP, and PCT, may be useful for differentiating between KD and viral/bacterial infections.","Procalcitonin (PCT), the prehormone of calcitonin, is released in response to proinflam matory stimuli, particularly bacteriaassociated mediators 1) . Recently, PCT has been more frequently used as a biomarker of sepsis than Creactive protein (CRP), another acutephase reactant 2) . In a study of PCT levels in adult patients in various inflammatory states, PCT levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients with bacterial or fungal infections, but normal or slightly elevated in those with several inflammatory diseases 3) . Furthermore, in a study of PCT levels in pediatric patients, PCT was found to be a significant biomarker for diagnosing pediatric urinary tract infection and neonatal sepsis, and for identifying patients without serious bacterial infections in order to prevent antimicrobial overuse in the pediatric intensive care unit 46) ."
Journal of Blood Medicine Dovepress Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: review of etiologies and management,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) covers a wide array of related life-threatening conditions featuring ineffective immunity characterized by an uncontrolled hyperinflammatory response. HLH is often triggered by infection. Familial forms result from genetic defects in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-cells, typically affecting perforin and intracellular vesicles. HLH is likely under-recognized, which contributes to its high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition is crucial for any reasonable attempt at curative therapy to be made. Current treatment regimens include immunosuppression, immune modulation, chemotherapy, and biological response modification, followed by hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (bone marrow transplant). A number of recent studies have contributed to the understanding of HLH pathophysiology, leading to alternate treatment options; however, much work remains to raise awareness and improve the high morbidity and mortality of these complex conditions.","Hemophagocytosis is the engulfment of hematopoietic cells by activated macrophages acting outside of usual immune system regulations. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) covers a wide array of related diseases including HLH, autosomal recessive familial HLH (FHL), familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, and autoimmune-associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). These disorders feature severe cytopenias due to this uncontrolled hemophagocytosis. Other laboratory signs and clinical symptoms result from disordered immune regulation and cytokine storm. The term primary HLH refers to an underlying genetic abnormality causing the disorder, whereas secondary HLH indicates that the disorder is secondary to underlying conditions such as infection, autoimmune/rheumatologic, malignant, or metabolic conditions. For the purposes of this review, FHL will indicate cases with a primary genetic cause, secondary HLH will refer to cases secondary to infection, malignancy, or metabolic disorders, and MAS will refer to cases associated with autoimmune diseases."
Human Bocavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection Original Article Clinical Microbiology KJLM,"Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified viral pathogen, and its clinical epidemiology and significance in respiratory infections have not yet been completely elucidated. We investigated the prevalence of HBoV infection and the association between viral (HBoV) load and clinical features of the infection in patients of all age-groups. Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with symptoms of respiratory infection were tested for presence of HBoV by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low-and high-viral-load groups using 1.0× 10 6 copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. Results: Detection rate of HBoV was 4.8% (N=93) in a total of 1,926 samples with peak incidence of infection being observed in patients aged 6-12 months. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr, and the HBoV load decreased with increase in age. HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses in 17 (18.3%) of the 93 HBoV-positive patients and 15 patients (88.2%) belonged to the low-viral-load group. Patients infected with HBoV alone showed a higher viral load than those patients in whom HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses (median load, 3.78× 10 5 copies/ mL vs. 1.94×10 4 copies/mL, P =0.014). Higher pulse rate (P =0.007) and respiratory rate (P =0.021) were observed in patients with a high-viral-load. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HBoV may be the causative agent of respiratory infection in the high-viral-load group.","Human bocavirus (HBoV) was newly discovered by Allander et al. [1] and was stated to be the possible causative agent of respiratory illness. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome of HBoV revealed that the virus is most closely related to canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus, which are members of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvoviridae family [1] ."
Construction and next-generation sequencing analysis of a large phage-displayed V NAR single-domain antibody library from six naïve nurse sharks,"Methods: Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named ""EASeL"") to construct a large V NAR antibody library with a size of 1.2 × 10 10 from six naïve adult nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum).","Classical immunoglobin G (IgG) is widely used in many biotechnologies and therapeutics [1] . IgG is best described as a heterodimeric homodimer, consisting of two copies of disulfide-bonded heavy (H) and light (L) chains. The H and L chain variable (V) domains (VH and VL, respectively) combine to form the antigen-binding region. When these two V domains are synthesized as a dual-domain singlechain V fragment (scFv), the minimum size of the fragment is 25-30 kDa. In recent years, single-domain immunoglobulins such as the shark V NAR (new antigen receptor variable domain) and the camelid heavy-chain variable domain (V H H) antibodies have been explored, both of which can be isolated as soluble, stable, monomeric binding domains [2] [3] [4] . These V NAR and V H H domain antibodies range from 12 to 15 kDa in size, roughly half the size of a scFv binding domain."
MERS-CoV recombination: implications about the reservoir and potential for adaptation,"Recombination is a process that unlinks neighboring loci allowing for independent evolutionary trajectories within genomes of many organisms. If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1,106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV-associated deaths as of 16 April 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this article, we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.","Recombination is an important process which expedites selection in many organisms (Muller 1932 ) by unlinking loci. It also leads to different parts of recombining genomes to have different histories which, if not properly accounted for, can interfere with many genetic analyses, of which phylogenetic methods are among the most sensitive. Not accounting for recombination in phylogenetic analyses leads to incorrect (Schierup and Hein 2000) and poorly supported genealogies (Posada and Crandall 2002) and false inference of selection (Anisimova, Nielsen, and Yang 2003; Shriner et al. 2003) ."
HUMAN RHINOVIRUS INFECTIONS IN SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC SUBJECTS,"The role of rhinovirus asymptomatic infections in the transmission among close contacts subjects is unknown. We tested health care workers, a pair of one child and a family member and immunocompromised patients (n =191). HRV were detected on 22.9% symptomatic and 3.6% asymptomatic cases suggesting lower transmission among contacts. Rhinovirus infections are among the most frequent causes of the common colds (18). It is the most common etiology of viral respiratory infections among diverse populations, including adults, children and more recent studies have linked HRVs to more severe lower respiratory illnesses in otherwise healthy young children (11-12), immunocompromised (4,6), and elderly patients. (5,13, 23). In Brazil, there are few HRV studies, Arruda et.al. (1991), realized the first Brazilian study detecting a 45.5% rate on symptomatic children in Fortaleza -CE. Another study realized in Salvador -BA also showed a high prevalence (48.5%) (Souza ,2003). The only study",describing adults was realized by Bellei and colleagues (2007) detecting 37.7%.
HIV-1 Modulates the tRNA Pool to Improve Translation Efficiency,"Despite its poorly adapted codon usage,","Viruses use the host translational machinery to translate their own mRNA. As a consequence, their codon usage is under selective pressure to adapt to the host transfer RNA (tRNA) pool (Sharp and Li 1987) . In RNA viruses in general and HIV-1 in particular, adaptation to the host is poor despite this selection (Bahir et al. 2009 ). For example, according to a recent compilation of tRNAs in human genome (Chan and Lowe 2009) , the AUC codon can be translated by 17 tRNA Ile species, that is, 14 tRNA Ile/IAU , and 3 tRNA Ile/GAU , AUU can be translated by 14 tRNA Ile/IAU species, whereas AUA can be translated by 5 tRNA Ile/UAU species only. In agreement with this, human genes code Ile mostly by AUC and least by AUA. In contrast, HIV-1 genes code Ile mostly by AUA and least by AUC (Haas et al. 1996; Nakamura et al. 2000) . The poor codon adaptation of HIV-1 reduces the translation efficiency of HIV-1 genes. Modifying HIV-1 codon usage according to host codon usage has been shown to increase the production of viral proteins (Haas et al. 1996; Ngumbela et al. 2008) ."
Detection of neutralizing antibody against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in subclinically infected finishing pigs,"The purpose of this study was to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) subclinically infected pigs shipped from non-case farms to slaughterhouses. Systematic sampling was conducted at two slaughterhouses. A total of 1,556 blood samples were collected from 80 case and non-case farms from pigs over 6 months old. Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain sera. Serial serum dilutions were subjected to serological examination for PEDV presence using Neutralization test (NT). The cut-off titer was set at titer of 1:2 dilution and farms with at least one positive sample in duplicate were classified as PED-positive farms. Several non-case farms (9.4%, 6/64) and 100% (16/16) of the case farms were indeed positive for PEDV. The proportion of seropositive animals from case farms was 63.7%, significantly different from that of non-case farms (4.3%, P<0.05). In both case and non-case farms, the proportion of seropositive animals in farrow-to-finish farms was significantly higher than in wean-to-finish farms (P<0.05). Seropositive animals in non-case farms were detected by NT in a sero-survey by sampling at slaughterhouses. Therefore, subclinically infected pigs should be considered prior to shipment.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms.18-0132 number of pig farms and heads in Japan (Fig. 1) . Between September 2016 and April 2017, 62 outbreaks were reported with more than 3,200 deaths [8] . To prevent the spread of PEDV between farms in Japan, some control measures were implemented. Hygienic management standards were enforced, including cleaning and disinfection of pig houses, changing clothes and boots of workers, and personnel and vehicle restriction [8] . Moreover, the use of attenuated PEDV vaccines in sows to provide maternal immunity is strongly recommended [8] ."
Detection of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Genome in an Air Sample Originating from a Camel Barn Owned by an Infected Patient,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel betacoronavirus that has been circulating in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 and causing severe respiratory infections in humans. While bats were suggested to be involved in human MERS-CoV infections, a direct link between bats and MERS-CoV is uncertain. On the other hand, serological and virological data suggest dromedary camels as the potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV. Recently, we isolated MERS-CoV from a camel and its infected owner and provided evidence for the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from the infected camel to the patient. Here, we extend this work and show that identical MERS-CoV RNA fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the same barn that sheltered the infected camel in our previous study. These data indicate that the virus was circulating in this farm concurrently with its detection in the camel and in the patient, which warrants further investigations for the possible airborne transmission of MERS-CoV.","ratory symptoms and renal failure (1, 2) . Since its emergence in 2012, there has been up to 536 laboratory-confirmed infections and 145 deaths in at least 17 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America (3) . Most of these cases originated from countries in or around the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Saudi Arabia (3) . The ability of this virus to infect those in close contact with an infected individual, such as family members and health care personnel, as well as the associated high mortality rate may represent a global public health threat (4) (5) (6) (7) ."
Age-Related Factors in Cyclosporine-Induced Syngeneic Graft-Versus-Host Disease: Regulatory Role of Marrow-Derived T Lymphocytes,"The present studies have evaluated the effect of age on the induction of syngeneic graft-versushost disease (SGVHD) after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and cyclosporine (CsA) therapy. The results clearly document an inverse correlation of age with the incidence of SGVHD. Virtually a 100% incidence of SGVHD occurs in Lewis rats when syngeneic BMT and CsA therapy are started when the animals are 4 wk of age . Thereafter, there is a dramatic decline in the incidence of SGVHD with the increasing age of the animals. Although the age of the recipient was important, the most significant effect was the age of the marrow donor . Marrow from animals 6 mo of age was virtually incapable of eliciting SGVHD after BMT and CsA therapy. Furthermore, mixing the marrow from mature and immature animals resulted in a decreased incidence of SGVHD, implicating a regulatory effect present in the marrow from older rats. This regulatory effect was due to the presence of mature T cells in the marrow from animals 6 mo of age. Despite the fact that marrow from young animals possesses mature T lymphocytes, this regulatory activity was absent, suggesting that the host resistance mediated by T lymphocytes develops as the animal ages. These data further implicate the importance of a host resistance mechanism in preventing the induction of SGVHD with CsA, which appears to be mediated by the clonal inactivation of autoreactive cells .","C yclosporine (CsA)l is a very potent immunosuppressive agent that has an apparent selective action on T lymphocyte-dependent immune responses (1, 2) . It has been used extensively in clinical transplantation to prevent solid organ allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (3, 4) . CsA is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic agent for the treatment ofautoimmune disease, and the results from these trials appear quite promising (5) . Despite its potent immunosuppressive activity, CsA therapy after autologous or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation paradoxically elicits a T cell-mediated autoimmune syndrome with pathology identical to GVHD occurring after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Hence, this CsA-induced autoimmune syndrome was originally termed syngeneic GVHD (SGVHD) (6) . The immunobiology of SGVHD is complex and is not completely understood, but it appears to be due to the uncoupling of normal immunologic homeostasis involved in self-nonself recognition (11) ."

"Virucidal Activity of World Health Organization-Recommended Formulations Against Enveloped Viruses, Including Zika, Ebola, and Emerging Coronaviruses","The World Health Organization (WHO) published 2 alcohol-based formulations to be used in healthcare settings and for outbreak-associated infections, but inactivation efficacies of these products have not been determined against (re-)emerging viruses. In this study, we evaluated the virucidal activity of these WHO products in a comparative analysis. Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as (re-)emerging viral pathogens and other enveloped viruses could be efficiently inactivated by both WHO formulations, implicating their use in healthcare systems and viral outbreak situations.","Hygienic hand antisepsis is one of the most important measures in preventing healthcare-and outbreak-associated viral infections. To reduce the spread of infections, biocides with a proven virucidal efficacy should be readily available. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed in its 2009 Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care the use of of 2 alcohol-based hand rubs (formulation I and formulation II) for surgical and hygiene hand disinfection in healthcare settings and to reduce the transmission of pathogens by hands [1] . However, limited data exist on the efficacy of disinfectants, including the WHO formulations, against novel viruses that have emerged during recent outbreaks in different parts of the world. Most recently, Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus that was discovered originally in Africa, has raised considerable international concern. In 2013, the largest and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV), a filovirus that spreads mainly through contact with body fluids of symptomatic patients or contaminated surfaces, occurred in West Africa [2] . One year previously in 2012, a novel Coronavirus (CoV) named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged, preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003, with both viruses causing acute respiratory diseases in humans and displaying a high case-fatality rate."

Infectious respiratory diseases in humans may be caused by several pathogens, including viruses and bacteria that produce very similar clinical symptoms and make diagnosis difficult [3, 4] . For this reason, an effective diagnostic assay for these pathogens in individual samples is urgently needed [5] . Furthermore, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and, more re-cently, the human and avian H5N1/H1N1 influenza virus cases underscore the importance of a rapid and accurate laboratory diagnostic method to characterize respiratory infections [6] ."

"Open Forum Infectious Diseases Incidence and Etiology of CAP • OFID • 1 Open Forum Infectious Diseases ® Incidence, Etiology, and Outcomes of Community- Acquired Pneumonia: A Population-Based Study","Background. The microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear in clinical practice, and previous studies have produced variable results. Population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. This study examined the incidence and etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization in a population-based cohort as well as risk factors and outcomes for specific etiologies.","Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading infectious cause of death worldwide, according the recently published 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, with rates increasing in many developed countries [1] . Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to infections acquired in the community, excluding healthcare-associated disease. Mild cases can be treated successfully at home, but severe cases require hospital admission and are associated with greater cost and suffer higher mortality [2] . Timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy is vital to improving outcomes, but minimizing unnecessary use of broad-spectrum agents is equally important [2] ."
Rethinking Biosafety in Research on Potential Pandemic Pathogens,"If accidentally released, mammalian-transmissible influenza A/H5N1 viruses could pose a greater threat to public health than possibly any other infectious agent currently under study in laboratories, because of such viruses' likely combination of transmissibility and virulence to humans. We advocate explicit risk-benefit assessments before work on such pathogens is permitted or funded, improvement of biosafety practices and enforcement, and harmonization of criteria for permitting such experiments across government agencies, as well as internationally. Such potential pandemic pathogens, as they have been called, jeopardize not only laboratory workers and their contacts, but also the wider population, who should be involved in assessments of when such risks are acceptable in the service of scientific knowledge that may itself bear major public health benefits.","M ammalian-transmissible, highly virulent influenza viruses pose a threat to human health and life much greater than that posed by most pathogens classified as biosafety level 3 and 4 (BSL-3 and BSL-4) agents. Therefore, any activity that creates even a small risk of releasing such viruses deserves exceptional scrutiny. The magnitude of public health risk from an accidental release of a pathogen depends on how many people could become infected, times the risk of severe or fatal outcome per case, and is modified by the availability of countermeasures that could stop the spread of such a pathogen or reduce the severity of infection. Most biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens-including certain arenaviruses (e.g., Lassa viruses), filoviruses (e.g., Ebola virus and Marburg virus), and Hendra viruses (e.g., Hendra virus and Nipah virus)-are zoonotic agents that often cause severe or fatal disease in infected humans. However, an accidental release of these viruses would likely have limited global impact because their person-to-person transmission is inefficient in most settings. In addition, they exist ""in the wild,"" so an accidental release would not be the only source for risk of transmission to humans. While influenza A/H5N1 virus exists in the wild, mammaliantransmissible strains do not exist outside the laboratory as far as we are aware. If a mammalian-transmissible variant maintains a case fatality rate within even an order of magnitude of the 60% case fatality rate of its wild-type parent (1) and if it is as transmissible between humans as other common influenza viruses that infect humans, an accidental release would pose a grave, and completely novel, threat to human health. Once a novel strain of influenza virus establishes significant transmission in humans, stopping its spread would require massive global use of vaccines, a scenario that has never been accomplished in practice and could not be done in time for H5N1 because sufficient stockpiles do not exist worldwide and trust in vaccines is declining globally (2) . Therefore, a highly transmissible, highly virulent virus like the modified H5N1 strains that have been created has the potential to infect billions and potentially kill a large fraction of those."

Understanding how cellular factors have evolved to inhibit HIV-1 reveals particularly vulnerable points of the viral replication cycle. Many, but not all, antiviral proteins share type I interferon-upregulated expression and sensitivity to viral counteraction or evasion measures. Whereas well-established restriction factors interfere with early post-entry steps and release of HIV-1, recent research has revealed a diverse set of proteins that reduce the infectious quality of released particles using individual, to date poorly understood modes of action. These include induction of paucity of mature glycoproteins in nascent virions or self-incorporation into the virus particle, resulting in poor infectiousness of the virion and impaired spread of the infection.","Like all intracellularly replicating pathogens, HIV-1 undergoes extensive interplay with cellular machineries and benefits from interactions with essential cofactors which enable and support HIV-1 replication. Well-known examples include the HIV-1 receptor CD4, chemokine coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, the Tat-interacting CyclinT1 that enhances processivity of the RNA polymerase II during LTR-mediated viral transcription and the nuclear mRNA export factor CRM1. On the contrary, eukaryotic cells dispose of a set of antiviral genes, whose expression is often induced or enhanced by type I interferons (IFNs), and whose products can effectively interfere with distinct steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. The impacts of anti-HIV-1 factors acting early post-entry and during virus release include SAMHD1, APOBEC3G, Mx2 and tetherin, respectively, and are discussed extensively elsewhere."
Aurintricarboxylic acid increases yield of HSV-1 vectors,"Production of large quantities of viral vectors is crucial for the success of gene therapy in the clinic. There is a need for higher titers of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) vectors both for therapeutic use as well as in the manufacturing of clinical grade adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors. HSV-1 yield increased when primary human fibroblasts were treated with anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone or valproic acid. In our search for compounds that would increase HSV-1 yield, we investigated another anti-inflammatory compound, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Although ATA has been previously shown to have antiviral effects, we find that low (micromolar) concentrations of ATA increased HSV-1 vector production yields. Our results showing the use of ATA to increase HSV-1 titers have important implications for the production of certain HSV-1 vectors as well as recombinant AAV vectors.","Recombinant adenovirus-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have been successfully introduced in several human gene therapy clinical trials because of their nonpathogenic nature, low toxicity, minimal immunogenicity, and long-term persistence. Production of large quantities of clinical grade rAAV vectors for gene therapy has been challenging due to limitations in scalability of the commonly used co-transfection protocol. 1 AAVs are not able to replicate by themselves and were first found to propagate only when adenoviruses or herpes viruses coinfected the same cells. 2, 3 The first scalable rAAV protocol was based on adenovirus infection of rAAV/Rep-Cap cell lines. 4 Besides adenoviruses, also herpesviruses have been shown to provide complete helper virus functions for the production of AAV virions. 5, 6 The minimal set of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) genes required for AAV replication and packaging has been identified as the HSV-1 early genes UL5, UL8, UL52, and UL29. 7 These genes encode components of the HSV-1 core replication machinery-the helicase, primase, and primase accessory proteins (U L 5, U L 8, and U L 52) and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (U L 29). A protocol for production of rAAV serotype 2 (rAAV2) vectors using HSV-1 amplicons expressing AAV2 Rep and Cap in combination with rHSV-1 helper vectors has been described, 8 and this protocol was modified and further optimized by several groups using coinfection of two rHSV-1 vectors, both replication-deficient infected-cell protein ICP27-mutants, one carrying rAAV provirus and a second bearing AAV2 Rep-cap genes, [9] [10] [11] The use of rHSV-1 vectors has been historically limited by their relatively low titers and the rAAV vector yields in the rHSV-based manufacturing, thus would be affected by the titers of rHSV-1 helper. 12, 13 Therefore, several methods to improve rHSV-1 yield have been studied, i.e., changing rHSV-1 propagation conditions [12] [13] [14] or using anti-inflammatory compounds known to inhibit the host defense mechanism, like dexamethasone or valproic acid. 15, 16 In our search for compounds that would increase HSV-1 yield, we investigated another anti-inflammatory compound, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). ATA is a heterogeneous mixture of polymers accredited with a continuously growing number of biological activities. [17] [18] [19] [20] ATA is mostly known as an antiviral agent to several viruses like HIV, herpesvirus HHV-7, SARS-CoV, and others. [20] [21] [22] [23] However, ATA did not block the replication of adenovirus type 5 24 and has been reported to increase adenovirus type 5 titer in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. 25 Here, we investigate the effects of ATA on HSV-1 vector production yield in V27, Vero, and HEK-293 cells. We further tested the rHSV-1 stocks produced in the presence of ATA in the HSV-1-based rAAV manufacturing protocol."
Rational design of a synthetic mammalian riboswitch as a ligand-responsive -1 ribosomal frame-shifting stimulator,"Metabolite-responsive RNA pseudoknots derived from prokaryotic riboswitches have been shown to stimulate −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), suggesting −1 PRF as a promising gene expression platform to extend riboswitch applications in higher eukaryotes. However, its general application has been hampered by difficulty in identifying a specific ligand-responsive pseudoknot that also functions as a ligand-dependent -1 PRF stimulator. We addressed this problem by using the −1 PRF stimulation pseudoknot of SARS-CoV (SARS-PK) to build a ligand-dependent −1 PRF stimulator. In particular, the extra stem of SARS-PK was replaced by an RNA aptamer of theophylline and designed to couple theophylline binding with the stimulation of −1 PRF. Conformational and functional analyses indicate that the engineered theophylline-responsive RNA functions as a mammalian riboswitch with robust theophyllinedependent −1 PRF stimulation activity in a stable human 293T cell-line. Thus, RNA-ligand interaction repertoire provided by in vitro selection becomes accessible to ligand-specific −1 PRF stimulator engineering using SARS-PK as the scaffold for synthetic biology application.","RNA modules capable of recognizing specific metabolites to regulate gene expression have been identified in the 5 UTR of a variety of prokaryotic genes (1) (2) (3) . Such riboswitches can control accessibility of Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences and intrinsic transcriptional termination hairpins to tune translation initiation and transcription termination efficiencies, respectively (1) (2) (3) . The ability to control RNA conformations by metabolites or artificial organic molecules to regulate specific gene expressions in higher eukaryotic systems could provide new opportunities in biomedical and synthetic biological applications (4, 5) ."
The impact of global budgeting in Taiwan on inpatients with unexplained fever,"Unexplained fever is one of the most common and difficult diagnostic problems faced daily by clinicians. This study evaluated the differences in health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care provided to patients with unexplained fever before and after global budget (GB) implementation in Taiwan.","Unexplained fever represents as one of the most common and difficult diagnostic problems encountered daily by clinicians; it is a febrile illness without an initially obvious etiology. [1, 2] When unexplained fever prolongs despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing, clinicians refer to it as fever of unknown origin (FUO). [3] Earlier, FUO was defined as a fever of ≥38.3°C lasting for ≥3 weeks with undiagnosed etiology even after 1 week of intensive hospital testing. [1] Physicians specializing in infectious diseases have redefined FUO as the fever of ≥38.3°C lasting for ≥3 weeks with undiagnosed etiology after 3 days of in-hospital testing or during ≥2 outpatient visits. [4] [5] [6] For pediatric FUO, the generally accepted definition is, a fever lasting 1-3 weeks without positive preliminary investigations or without a diagnosis after three outpatient clinic visits. [7, 8] FUO can be divided into following four general categories based on the etiology of fever: infection, rheumatic-inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous. [9] Infectious diseases account for approximately one-third of FUO. The most common infections associated with FUO are miliary tuberculosis (TB), Q fever, and brucellosis, followed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); cytomegalovirus (CMV); Epstein-Barr virus; intra-abdominal, pelvic, intranephric and perinephric abscess; typhoid or enteric fever; toxoplasmosis; and extrapulmonary TB. Notably, in 75% of the HIV patients, FUO is results from secondary infection, rather than from the HIV infection. [10] Furthermore, rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, giant cell/temporal arteritis, adult Still disease, periarteritis nodosa, and microscopic polyangiitis, account for another one-third of FUOs. [10] Moreover, FUOs due to neoplasms and malignancies account for 18% of all FUOs; of them, renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma are the most common neoplasms, followed by acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders. [10] The remaining causes of FUO are miscellaneous disorders, including drug fevers, liver cirrhosis, Crohn disease, and subacute thyroiditis. [10] FUO, a challenge for physicians to diagnose and manage currently, represents approximately 3% of hospital admissions, with morbidity caused by prolonged hospital stay, and mortality rates accounting 12%-35%. Furthermore, FUO is associated with repeated invasive investigations, presumptive treatment, and a high impact on health care systems due to unnecessary and additional laboratory tests and medications. [10, 11] Over 200 causes for FUO have been reported. [10] Relatively few infectious diseases have the potential to cause prolonged fever; therefore, patients with prolonged and perplexing fevers, in whom the infection has been ruled out, pose a diagnostic challenge. [12] Moreover, fever is one of the most common reasons for outpatient visits of children and visits to emergency department (ED). [13] Difficulty in diagnosing FUO also makes its treatment difficult. Empirical antibiotics cannot be indicated unless the patient with FUO is neutropenic. In addition, empiric glucocorticoids cannot be indicated without a strong evidence of rheumatologic disease. [14] Recurrent FUO, which is a strong independent predictor of unestablished diagnosis, represents 18%-42% of the cases in large series. In addition, a final diagnosis can be established in only 49% of patients with recurrent FUO. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] A comprehensive and careful history-taking as well as examination by physician and exhaustive laboratory testing have are required for a focused diagnostic evaluation of FUO. [4] The diagnostic approaches for FUO include medical historytaking, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The etiologies of fever may be approached in terms of their height, fever pattern, and duration. Most studies have stressed on the significance of a complete history and comprehensive physical examination. In case of infectious FUO, fever is often accompanied by chills, night sweating, weight loss without loss of appetite, rigors, exudative tonsillitis, or splenomegaly. In general, the longer the FUO remains undiagnosed, the more likely it is to have a noninfectious etiology. [22] A patient presenting with B-symptoms and significant weight loss might have a neoplasm or malignancy as the cause of the FUO. By contrast, joint involvement may indicate rheumatologic disorders. [10, 23] Laboratory testing includes complete blood count, three sets of blood cultures, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete metabolic panel, urinalysis, urine culture, tuberculin skin test, and tests for biomarkers (such as antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, CMV immunoglobulin M, HIV antibodies, and heterophile antibodies) in children and young adults. Moreover, imaging techniques include chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), and radionuclide scanning. [24] FUO is associated with broad differential diagnosis leading to a wide range of potential diagnostic and therapeutic costs. However, little is known regarding the hospitalization costs for patients with FUO. Recent studies have reported high hospitalization charges for FUO (US$25,000-US$180,000). [25, 26] The National Health Insurance (NHI) program, the backbone of the health care system in Taiwan, is the major source of health financing and covers 99% of the population of Taiwan. National health care expenditure in Taiwan increased from 5.3% in 1995 to 6.0% in 2001 of the gross national product. The NHI operated on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis and as a result health care spending increased by approximately 50% from 1995 to 2001. To prevent unlimited and rapid growth of spending on health care, the Bureau of NHI (BNHI) implemented the global budget (GB) system to modify the FFS mechanism in 2002. The GB in Taiwan is an overall spending target, designed to limit the volume of service and its total price. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Here, we evaluated the differences in health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care among patients with unexplained fever before and after GB system implementation by using NHI Research Database (NHIRD) data."
The Journal of Infectious Diseases High Environmental Stability of Hepatitis B Virus and Inactivation Requirements for Chemical Biocides,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is considered a major public health problem worldwide, and a significant number of reports on nosocomial and occupational outbreaks have been reported. This systematic investigation of HBV stability and susceptibility to different antiseptics revealed that HBV infectivity was very stable, with a half-life of >22 days at 37°C. At 4°C, infectivity was barely reduced for up to 9 months. Different alcohols and commercially available hand antiseptics had a virucidal effect against HBV. We propose that very strict compliance with established hygienic guidelines should be mandatory to avoid and prevent HBV infections.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a severe health burden, with approximately 2 billion infected people and >250 million chronically infected carriers [1] . HBV is the major cause of chronic liver diseases, the primary causative agent of hepatocellular carcinoma, and responsible for 887 000 deaths worldwide annually [2] . Despite the availability of vaccines and drugs, chronic hepatitis B is still an incurable disease. HBV is a small, enveloped, hepatotropic DNA virus belonging to the family Hepadnaviridae [3] ."
Animal Models of Cardiac Disease and Stem Cell Therapy,"Animal models that mimic cardiovascular diseases are indispensable tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying the diseases at the cellular and molecular level. This review focuses on various methods in preclinical research to create small animal models of cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocarditis and cardiac hypertrophy, and the related stem cell treatment for these diseases","Cardiovascular disease is considered the major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Over the past several years, great achievement has been made in the treatment/management of cardiovascular diseases, which have depended on the use of experimental animal models. With the use of disease models in preclinical research, a large amount of information has been generated, which has outlined the pathogenesis, progression and mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases at the cellular and molecular level. This has allowed the development of many effective treatment strategies. Cardiovascular disease models have been developed in many species, including large animals such as swines and dogs [1, 2] , as well as, small animals such as rats and mice [3] [4] [5] . Small animal models are more applicable to research work compared to large animal models due to their inexpensiveness, convenience in handling and the vast amount of scientific literature available [6] . In this review, we mainly focus on various methods used by investigators to create small animal models of cardiac disease, such as myocardial infarction (MI), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), heart failure (HF), myocarditis and cardiac hypertrophy (CH) and the related stem cell treatment for these diseases."
The Organization of Endoplasmic Reticulum Export Complexes,"Export of cargo from the ER occurs through the formation of 60-70-nm COPII-coated vesicular carriers.

The Influenza A Virus Endoribonuclease PA-X Usurps Host mRNA Processing Machinery to Limit Host Gene Expression Article The Influenza A Virus Endoribonuclease PA-X Usurps Host mRNA Processing Machinery to Limit Host Gene Expression,"Graphical Abstract Highlights d Influenza A virus PA-X targets the majority of host mRNAs for destruction d Downregulation by PA-X correlates with the number of splice sites in a transcript d Splicing renders RNAs susceptible to PA-X d The cellular CFIm complex interacts with PA-X and contributes to PA-X activity Correspondence craig.mccormick@dal.ca (C.M.), d.khaperskyy@dal.ca (D.A.K.), marta.gaglia@tufts.edu (M.M.G.) In Brief Gaucherand et al. uncover a unique relationship between RNA degradation by the influenza A virus ribonuclease PA-X and host RNA splicing, which allows PA-X to selectively target host RNAs for destruction.","Despite their small genomes, influenza A viruses (IAVs) dedicate multiple proteins to the suppression of host gene expression, or ''host shutoff,'' which limits host antiviral responses. One of these IAV host shutoff proteins is the endoribonuclease PA-X, which selectively degrades host RNAs Khaperskyy et al., 2016) and limits innate immune responses in vivo. PA-X-deficient viruses induce stronger innate immune and inflammatory responses in mice, chickens, and pigs (Gao et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2017; Hayashi et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015 Hu et al., , 2016 Jagger et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2017) . In some IAV strains, the immune-evasion activity of PA-X reduces inflammationinduced pathology, thereby protecting the host and reducing mortality (Gao et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2015 Hu et al., , 2016 Jagger et al., 2012) . While the role of PA-X in immune evasion is well established, its molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood."
An intermolecular RNA triplex provides insight into structural determinants for the pseudoknot stimulator of Z1 ribosomal frameshifting,"An efficient Z1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal requires an RNA slippery sequence and a downstream RNA stimulator, and the hairpin-type pseudoknot is the most common stimulator. However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote Z1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several Z1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of Z1 PRF. Structurebased mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the Z1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base-triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem-loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the Z1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate Z1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate Z1 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that Z1 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific basetriple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.","During translation, the ribosomes have to maintain correct reading frame to faithfully decode the in-frame messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences into ordered amino acid sequences. However, specific information within mRNAs can trigger the slippage of reading frames for elongating ribosomes, and thus lead to the frameshifting events (1) . In one case, the ribosomes are induced to move backward one base in the 5 0 direction in response to specific signals within mRNAs, and then continue translation in the new À1 reading frame (2) . Such a À1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is adopted by a variety of viruses to maintain a specific ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , and examples of À1 PRF in cellular genes are also reported (8) (9) (10) . The mechanism for the induction of À1 PRF by a stimulator is a delicate process and may involve multiple factors. Efficient eukaryotic À1 PRF requires two in cis RNA elements within the mRNA (11, 12) : a heptanucleotide slippery site of XXXYYYZ sequences, where the frameshift occurs, and a downstream RNA structure connected by a spacer. The optimal distance between stimulator and slippery site, separated by the spacer, will then position the A-and P-site tRNAs on the slippery site (13) (14) (15) . With the sequence feature of X being any three identical nucleotides, Y being either AAA or UUU, and Z not being a G, these cooperative RNA elements can increase the probability of a ribosome to slip with A-and P-site tRNAs in the 5 0 direction by one base along the mRNA (from X XXY YYZ to XXX YYY Z) (15) ."
Advances and Applications in Bioinformatics and Chemistry Dovepress Identification of potential drug targets by subtractive genome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7: an in silico approach,"Bacterial enteric infections resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, or enteric fever constitute a huge public health problem, with more than a billion episodes of disease annually in developing and developed countries. In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen's survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bioinformatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfonamide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein.

Metagenomic Assay for Identification of Microbial Pathogens in Tumor Tissues,"Screening for thousands of viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites, in human tumor tissues will provide a better understanding of the contributory role of the microbiome in the predisposition for, causes of, and therapeutic responses to the associated cancer. Metagenomic assays designed to perform these tasks will have to include rapid and economical processing of large numbers of samples, supported by straightforward data analysis pipeline and flexible sample preparation options for multiple input tissue types from individual patients, mammals, or environmental samples. To meet these requirements, the PathoChip platform was developed by targeting viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic genomes with multiple DNA probes in a microarray format that can be combined with a variety of upstream sample preparation protocols and downstream data analysis. PathoChip screening of DNA plus RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues demonstrated the utility of this platform, and the detection of oncogenic viruses was validated using independent PCR and deep sequencing methods. These studies demonstrate the use of the PathoChip technology combined with PCR and deep sequencing as a valuable strategy for detecting the presence of pathogens in human cancers and other diseases.","; T-cell leukemia virus type 1; and human T-cell leukemia virus type 2), one bacterium (Helicobacter pylori), and two helminths (schistosomes and liver flukes) which are major contributors to cancers as etiological agents (1) .

Methamphetamine induces autophagy as a pro-survival response against apoptotic endothelial cell death through the Kappa opioid receptor,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant with high abuse potential and severe neurotoxicity. Recent studies in animal models have indicated that METH can impair the blood-brain barrier (BBB), suggesting that some of the neurotoxic effects resulting from METH abuse could be due to barrier disruption. We report here that while chronic exposure to METH disrupts barrier function of primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), an early pro-survival response is observed following acute exposure by induction of autophagic mechanisms. Acute METH exposure induces an early increase in Beclin1 and LC3 recruitment. This is mediated through inactivation of the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathway, and upregulation of the ERK1/2. Blockade of Kappa opioid receptor (KOR), and treatment with autophagic inhibitors accelerated METH-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the early autophagic response is a survival mechanism for endothelial cells and is mediated through the kappa opioid receptor.","J Ma 1 , J Wan 1 , J Meng 2 , S Banerjee 1 , S Ramakrishnan 2 and S Roy* , 1, 2 Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant with high abuse potential and severe neurotoxicity.

Zoonotic origin and transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the UAE HHS Public Access,"Since the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, there have been a number of clusters of human-to-human transmission. These cases of human-tohuman transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings, and they are suspected to result from repeated zoonotic introductions. In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in September 2012 (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012) . It is a group C betacoronavirus, distantly related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in 2002 -2003 (Zaki et al., 2012 . Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus also causes a similar acute respiratory illness, and as of December 2017, 2103 cases have been confirmed in 27 countries with 733 deaths (35% case fatality ratio) (World Health Organization, 2017) . Infection has been diagnosed in multiple countries, but all cases have an epidemiologic link to the Middle East."
Interpreting specific and general respiratory indicators in syndromic surveillance,To improve understanding of the relative burden of different causative respiratory pathogens on respiratory syndromic indicators monitored using syndromic surveillance systems in England.,"Public Health England (PHE) uses syndromic surveillance systems to monitor for seasonal increases in respiratory illness. Respiratory illnesses create a considerable burden on health care services and therefore identifying the timing and intensity of peaks of activity is important for public health decision-making. Furthermore, identifying the incidence of specific respiratory pathogens circulating in the community is essential for targeting public health interventions e.g. vaccination. Syndromic surveillance can provide early warning of increases, but cannot explicitly identify the pathogens responsible for such increases."
Respiratory Viral Infections after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children,"This study was performed to characterize respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Study samples included 402 respiratory specimens obtained from 358 clinical episodes that occurred in the 116 children of the 175 consecutive HSCT cohort at Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Korea from 2007 to 2010. Multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions were performed for rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, human coronavirus (hCoV), influenza viruses and human metapneumovirus. Viruses were identified in 89 clinical episodes that occurred in 58 patients. Among the 89 clinical episodes, frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus in 25 (28.1%), RSV in 23 (25.8%), PIV-3 in 16 (18.0%), adenovirus in 12 (13.5%), and hCoV in 10 (11.2%). Lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 34 (38.2%). Neutropenia was present in 24 (27.0%) episodes and lymphopenia was in 31 (34.8%) episodes. Sixty-three percent of the clinical episodes were hospital-acquired. Three patients died of respiratory failure caused by respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients who have undergone HSCT are common and are frequently acquired during hospitalization. Continuous monitoring is required to determine the role of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised children and the importance of preventive strategies.","Respiratory infections are important complications in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (1, 2) . Broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered in children after HSCT to prevent bacterial pneumonia, and antifungal agents and strict screening systems are used for prophylaxis of fatal fungal infections. These efforts have been effective for improving the survival of HSCT patients."
NOTE Reliability of clinical diagnosis and laboratory testing techniques currently used for identification of canine parvovirus enteritis in clinical settings,"Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is the main etiological agent of viral enteritis in dogs. Actually in literature, CPV-2 has been reported with clinical signs that vary from the classical disease, and immunochromatography test and PCR technique have been introduced to veterinary hospitals to confirm CPV-2 diagnosis and other infections. However, the reliability of these techniques has been poorly analyzed. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of veterinary clinical diagnosis, immunochromatography test and PCR technique. Our data indicate that variations in the clinical signs of CPV-2 complicate the gathering of an appropriate diagnosis; and immunochromatography test and PCR technique do not have adequate sensitivity to diagnose positive cases.","diagnosis in a discrete manner, using the problem oriented veterinary medical record (POVMR) as their diagnostic tool."
Exploratory cohort study to determine if dry cow vaccination with a Salmonella Newport bacterin can protect dairy calves against oral Salmonella challenge,"Background: Salmonellosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal calves, often occurring before preventative vaccines can be administered.","Diarrhea remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal dairy calves despite efforts to decrease the incidence of diarrhea through colostral management, sanitation, and housing. Diarrhea caused by salmonellosis can lead to substantially higher mortality in outbreaks, particularly in calves within the first few weeks of life. 1 Preventing these early-life Salmonella infections is particularly difficult because no vaccines are labeled for use in young calves. Extra-label use of commercially available vaccines has not been effective 2 and is anecdotally associated with clinically relevant adverse effects. Colostral immunity stimulated by vaccinating dry cows for Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus has been used extensively in the dairy and beef industries to protect calves against diarrhea challenge. 3, 4 Previous data also indicate that vaccination of dry cows can decrease fecal shedding of Salmonella in young calves. [5] [6] [7] However, the concept of using dry cow vaccination to decrease clinical disease caused by Salmonella in calves has not been well examined."
Sorting of Progeny Coronavirus from Condensed Secretory Proteins at the Exit from the Trans-Gol Network of AtT20 Cells,"Murine hepatitis virus (strain A59), (MHV-A59) is a coronavirus that buds into pre-Golgi compartments and then exploits the exocytic pathway of the host cell to reach the exterior. The fibroblastic cells in which replication of this virus is usually studied have only a constitutive exocytic pathway that the virus uses. MHV-A59 also infects, albeit inefficiently, AtT20 calls, murine pituitary tumor cells with a regulated as well as a constitutive exoeytic pathway. Here we examine AtT20 cells at early times after the infection, when the Golgi apparatus retains its morphological and biochemical integrity. We observe that progeny coronavirus and secretory protein destined for the secretory granules of the regulated exocytic pathway traverse the same Golgi stacks and accumulate in the trans-Golgi network. Their pathways diverge at this site, the condensed secretory proteins including the ACTH going to the secretory granules and the coronavirus to post-Golgi transport vesicles devoid of ACTH. On very rare occasions there is missorting such that aggregates of condensed secretory proteins and viruses occur together in post-Golgi vesicles. We conclude that the constitutive and regulated exocytic pathways, identified respectively by the progeny virions and the secretory protein ACTH, diverge at the exit from the trans-Golgi network.","I N cells of the anterior pituitary tumor cell line ART20 there are two exocytic pathways, one is constitutive and the other is regulated, such that secretion is enhanced by seeretagogues (Gumbiner and Kelly, 1982) . The major envelope glycoprotein of an endogenous murine leukemia virus (Gumbiner and Kelly, 1982) and the secreted glycoprotein laminin (Burgess et al., 1985) are examples of proteins that are exported via the constitutive pathway. On the other hand, part of the proopiomelanocortin made in these calls follows the regulated pathway in which it is cleaved proteolyrically to yield ACTH and is stored in secretory granules (Gumbiner and Kelly, 1982; Moore and Kelly, 1985) . Foreign peptide hormones, specified by cloned genes from various endocrine and exocrine cells transfected into AtT20 cells, are sorted into the secretory granules of the regulated pathway (reviewed in Kelly, 1985) . Condensed secretory proteins first accumulate in the trans-most Golgi compartment of AtT20 cells. This extreme trans-compartment, which lies beyond the TPPase-positive cisternae of the Golgi stack and has been termed the trans-Golgi network or trans-Golgi reticulum (Griffiths and Simons, 1986) , is the site of formation of the secretory granules of the regulated pathway ."
A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF PANDEMIC INFLUENZA A(H1N1)PDM09,"Influenza A viruses undergo frequent antigenic mutations and may thus cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. The aim of this study was to recover the epidemiological history of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Brazil. A descriptive study was conducted in 2009-2010. The Brazilian Information System for reportable diseases (SINAN) was the data source. A total of 105,054 suspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were reported to SINAN. Of these, 53,797 (51.2%) were classified as the new influenza virus subtype. Among the confirmed cases, 56.7% were female, the mean age was 26.31 (SD ± 18.1) years. Fever was the most common sign among the confirmed cases (99.7%) and the presence of comorbidities was reported in 32.5% of cases. In 2009 there were confirmed cases in all 26 Brazilian States and the Federal District. The incidence (per 100,000 inhabitants) of severe influenza in the population was 28.0 in 2009 and 0.5 in 2010. The states of Paraná (301.3), Santa Catarina (36.0) and Rio Grande do Sul (27.4) presented the highest incidence; 46.4% of the confirmed cases were hospitalized and 47,643 were cured (93.8%). The case-fatality rate was 3.9% in 2009. The pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09 hit Brazil between April/2009 and December/2010 with an important difference in the geographic pattern distribution of the cases from the northeast to the south of the country. Children and young adults were the most affected. The limitations of the study were data quality and inconsistencies in the final classification of cases in SINAN. This study highlights the urgent need for improvements in the surveillance of emerging diseases in Brazil.",Influenza or flu is an acute disease of the respiratory system and is present worldwide. The antigenic mutation capacity of the influenza A virus can cause pandemics with great social and economic repercussions 1 .
Genome Stability of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Based on Analysis of Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase Genes,"Influenza A virus (H1N1), which arose in 2009, constituted the fourth pandemic after the cases of 1918, 1957, and 1968. This new variant was formed by a triple reassortment, with genomic segments from swine, avian, and human influenza origins. The objective of this study was to analyze sequences of hemagglutinin (n=2038) and neuraminidase (n=1273) genes, in order to assess the extent of diversity among circulating 2009-2010 strains, estimate if these genes evolved through positive, negative, or neutral selection models of evolution during the pandemic phase, and analyze the worldwide percentage of detection of important amino acid mutations that could enhance the viral performance, such as transmissibility or resistance to drugs. A continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants, especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds, in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential.","Influenza A viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, and have a genome composed of eight segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA. Their surfaces are composed by a lipid envelope, originated from the plasmatic membrane of infected epithelial cells, and two antigenic proteins: Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA); these two antigens exhibit higher variability compared with their remaining proteins [1] . Depending on the extent of variability of two surface proteins, until now are known 16 HA (H1-H16), and 9 NA genotypes (N1-N9), respectively, which can be combined in different combinations [1, 2] ."
PRSS contributes to cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer,"Cetuximab improves the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The main limitation is primary and secondary resistance, the underlying mechanism of which requires extensive investigation. We proved that PRSS expression levels are significantly negatively associated with the sensitivity of cancer cells to cetuximab. Detailed mechanistic analysis indicated that PRSS can cleave cetuximab, leading to resistance. Cetuximab or bevacizumab combined with SPINK1, a PRSS inhibitor, inhibited cell growth more efficiently than cetuximab or bevacizumab alone in xenograft models. PRSS levels in the serum of 156 patients with mCRC were analyzed, and poor efficacy of cetuximab therapy was observed in patients with aberrant PRSS expression. PRSS expression in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-treated patients with cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database was also evaluated to determine whether patients with higher PRSS expression have significantly reduced progression-free survival. Our work provides a strong scientific rationale for targeting PRSS in combination with cetuximab therapy.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer mortality and morbidity in both developed and developing countries (1, 2) and is the world's fourth deadliest cancer (after lung, liver, and stomach cancer), accounting for almost 881,000 deaths in 2018 (3, 4) . Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog/human epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB/ HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is one of the most prominent therapeutic targets in metastatic CRC (mCRC). EGFR is commonly overexpressed on the cell membrane in several cancers, including lung, colon, head and neck, and esophageal cancer. Ligand binding causes homo-and heterodimerization between EGFR and other HER family members (ERBB2/HER2, ERBB4/HER4, and kinaseinactive ERBB3/HER3), resulting in downstream activation of the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways (5) and eventually accelerating cell growth and carcinogenesis. Accordingly, numerous targeted molecules have been developed to either block ligand binding or inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity."
FULL PAPER Virology Development and application of multiplex PCR assays for detection of virus-induced respiratory disease complex in dogs,"Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) viruses have been detected in dogs with respiratory illness. Canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and canine herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1), are all associated with the CIRDC. To allow diagnosis, two conventional multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were developed to simultaneously identify four RNA and two DNA viruses associated with CIRDC. The two multiplex PCR assays were then validated on 102 respiratory samples collected from 51 dogs with respiratory illness by sensitivity and specificity determination in comparison to conventional simplex PCR and a rapid three-antigen test kit. All six viruses were detected in either individual or multiple infections. The developed multiplex PCR assays had a >87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to their simplex counterpart. Compared to the three-antigen test kit, the multiplex PCR assays yielded 100% sensitivity and more than 83% specificity for detection of CAdV-2 and CDV, but not for CIV. Therefore, the developed multiplex PCR modalities were able to simultaneously diagnose a panel of CIRDC viruses and facilitated specimen collection through being suitable for use of nasal or oral samples. KEY WORDS: canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), diagnosis, multiplex PCRs, Thailand","Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), also known as kennel cough or infectious tracheobronchitis, is a highly acute respiratory disease in dogs that affects the larynx, trachea, bronchi and, occasionally, the nasal mucosa [3, 21] . The CIRDC is not only associated with infectious pathogens, but environmental factors and host immune responses also play an equally important role [7] . The pathogens causing CIRDC consist of viruses, bacteria or both, and are airborne-transmitted from infected dogs, particularly those living in poorly ventilated kennels, animal shelters and veterinary hospitals [3] . A CIRDC infection usually results in delaying of rehoming, interruption of training courses and requires high cost treatments [7] . Mildly productive cough and nasal discharge initially present as the most common clinical signs, which is self-limited within a short period in most infected dogs. It is not fatal unless other complicating factors are involved, such as secondary bacterial infection or an immunosuppressed condition [7] . Several episodes of CIRDC infection have been shown for a variety of viral agents. Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) is the most frequently detected agent in CIRDC dogs [16] . Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV) have also frequently been reported in dogs with severe respiratory distress [7, 16, 17] . Canine herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) has been isolated from both puppies and adult dogs with fatal dyspnea [3, 7] . Canine influenza virus (CIV) [14, 16] and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) have recently been discovered from the respiratory tract of dogs with flu-like symptoms during a massive human flu outbreak [5, 6, 8] ."
Spacer-length dependence of programmed À1 or À2 ribosomal frameshifting on a U 6 A heptamer supports a role for messenger RNA (mRNA) tension in frameshifting,"Programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting is employed in the expression of a number of viral and cellular genes. In this process, the ribosome slips backwards by a single nucleotide and continues translation of an overlapping reading frame, generating a fusion protein.","Accurate maintenance of the translational reading frame is essential in the production of functional proteins and spontaneous frameshifting occurs rarely, with an estimated frequency (in Escherichia coli) of 3 Â 10 À3 -5Â 10 À5 per codon (1) . In some genes, however, mRNA elements are present that induce the ribosome to change reading frame at very high frequencies (reviewed in [2] [3] [4] . These sites of programmed ribosomal frameshifting direct ribosomes into an overlapping open reading frame (ORF), generating a fusion protein containing the products of both upstream and downstream ORFs. Most widespread are sites of programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 FS) where the ribosome slips back one nucleotide (nt) in the 5 0 -direction on the mRNA. Frameshifting in eukaryotes was first described as the mechanism by which the Gag-Pol polyprotein of the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is expressed from overlapping gag and pol ORFs (5,6) and related signals have since been documented in many other viruses, including the clinically important human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (7) (HIV-1, HIV-2), human T-cell lymphotrophic virus types 1 and 2 (8, 9) and the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (10) . Frameshifting has also been increasingly recognized in conventional cellular genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in other replicating elements, such as insertion sequences and transposons."
Paper Bovine respiratory syncytial virus: infection dynamics within and between herds,"The infection dynamics of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were studied in randomly selected Norwegian dairy herds. A total of 134 herds were tested twice, six months apart. The herds were classified as positive for BRSV if at least one animal between 150 and 365 days old tested positive for antibodies against BRSV, thereby representing herds that had most likely had the virus present during the previous year. The prevalence of positive herds at the first and second sampling was 34 per cent and at 41 per cent, respectively, but varied greatly between regions. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds. Some of these herds remained negative despite several new infections nearby. Of the herds initially being negative, 42 per cent changed status to positive during the six months. This occurred at the same rate during summer as winter, but a higher rate of animals in the herds was positive if it took place during winter. Of the herds initially being positive, 33 per cent changed to negative. This indicates that an effective strategy to lower the prevalence and the impact of BRSV could be to employ close surveillance and place a high biosecurity focus on the negative herds.","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex, detrimentally impacting production and animal welfare in the cattle industry all over the world (Griffin 1997 , Snowder and others 2006 , Brodersen 2010 . Clinical signs vary from none to severe, with most outbreaks occurring during the winter season (van der Poel and others 1993, others 1997, Valarcher and Taylor 2007) ."
Geographical disparities in emergency department presentations for acute respiratory infections and risk factors for presenting: a population-based cohort study of Western Australian children,"Introduction Studies examining acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in emergency department (EDs), particularly in rural and remote areas, are rare. This study aimed to examine the burden of ARIs among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children presenting to Western Australian (WA) EDs from 2002 to 2012. Method Using a retrospective population-based cohort study linking ED records to birth and perinatal records, we examined presentation rates for metropolitan, rural and remote Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from 469 589 births. We used ED diagnosis information to categorise presentations into ARI groups and calculated age-specific rates. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate association between risk factors and frequency of ARI presentation. results Overall, 26% of presentations were for ARIs. For Aboriginal children, the highest rates were for those aged <12 months in the Great Southern (1233 per 1000 childyears) and Pilbara regions (1088 per 1000 child-years). Rates for non-Aboriginal children were highest in children <12 months in the Southwest and Kimberley (400 and 375 per 1000 child-years, respectively). Presentation rates for ARI in children from rural and remote WA significantly increased over time in all age groups <5 years. Risk factors for children presenting to ED with ARI were: male, prematurity, caesarean delivery and residence in the Kimberley region and lower socio-economic areas. Conclusion One in four ED presentations in WA children are for ARIs, representing a significant out-of-hospital burden with some evidence of geographical disparity. Planned linkages with hospital discharge and laboratory detection data will aid in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of ARI diagnoses in ED.","Globally, acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are responsible for approximately one in five deaths in children aged <5 years and are a major cause of childhood morbidity. 1 Most literature on the burden of ARI in Australian children comes from studies examining hospitalisation data, limiting knowledge to the severe end of the clinical spectrum. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In Western Australia (WA), 25% of Aboriginal children and 6.5% of non-Aboriginal children are hospitalised at least once for ARI, with infant hospitalisation rates of 276.1/1000 child-years in Aboriginal children and 44.7/1000 child-years in non-Aboriginal children. 7 A higher infant hospitalisation rate for ARI of 426.7/1000 child-years in Aboriginal children was identified in the Northern Territory. 4 Community-level data on the burden of ARI are important for prevention and policy development. Emergency department (ED) strengths and limitations of this study ► This study demonstrates that emergency department presentation for acute respiratory infections is common in children and identifies population subgroups that use emergency services more frequently than others. ► We have conducted a state-wide in-depth investigation into the diagnostic information available from the emergency department data systems with regard to respiratory infections and provided age-specific presentation rates by condition and by geographic location, which can inform future disease control strategies. ► As emergency department location was not available the postcode of the child at birth was used to stratify data by location, which is a limitation of this study."
Echovirus 7 Entry into Polarized Intestinal Epithelial Cells Requires Clathrin and Rab7,"Enteroviruses invade the host by crossing the intestinal mucosa, which is lined by polarized epithelium. A number of enteroviruses, including echoviruses (EV) and group B coxsackieviruses (CVB), initiate infection by attaching to decayaccelerating factor (DAF), a molecule that is highly expressed on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. We previously observed that entry of DAF-binding CVB3 into polarized intestinal epithelial cells occurs by an unusual endocytic mechanism that requires caveolin but does not involve clathrin or dynamin. Here we examined the entry of a DAF-binding echovirus, EV7. We found that drugs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and dominant negative mutants that target factors required for clathrinmediated endocytosis, including clathrin and dynamin, inhibited both EV7 infection and internalization of virions from the cell surface. Once virus had entered the cell, it colocalized with markers of early endosomes (EEA1) and then late endosomes (LAMP-2). Inhibition of endosomal maturation-with siRNAs or dominant negative mutants targeting Rab5 and Rab7-inhibited infection and prevented release of viral RNA into the cell. These results indicate that EV7 is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and then moves to early and late endosomes before releasing its RNA. Trafficking through endosomes is known to be important for viruses that depend on low pH or endosomal cathepsin proteases to complete the entry process. However, we found that EV7 infection required neither low pH nor cathepsins.","the viral receptor induces conformational changes in the virus capsid and begins the uncoating process. Such changes are observed when poliovirus interacts with its receptor, PVR (11) , or when coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) interacts with the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, CAR (12) ; the initial conformational changes can be detected by altered sedimentation profiles in sucrose gradients, with native virions sedimenting at 150S to 160S and altered particles sedimenting at 135S. Rhinovirus capsids are unstable at low pH, and for some rhinoviruses uncoating occurs when the virion is delivered to an acidic endosome (13) . However, most enteroviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route and must survive exposure to stomach acid; in consequence, their capsids are stable at low pH, and their uncoating appears to be independent of endosomal acidification."

EPIDEMIC AND CASE INVESTIGATIONS Surveillance operation for the 141st confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in response to the patient's prior travel to Jeju Island,"The provincial government of Jeju, South Korea, was notified that a 42-year-old man infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus had gone sightseeing in Jeju Island. Although the visiting period might be interpreted as the incubation period of MERS, the province decided to conduct active surveillance to prevent a worst-case scenario. Based on the channel of movement of the patient, healthy isolation and active monitoring were conducted for persons who came in contact with the patient. During the active surveillance, none of the 56 persons in self-isolation and 123 persons under active monitoring became infected. This fact supports that MERS is not contagious during the incubation period.","A 42-year-old man who was residing in Seoul had a sudden fever at a body temperature of 38°C at dawn on June 10, 2015. After recalling that he visited the outpatient clinic of Samsung Medical Center in Seoul with his father on May 27, during which the 14th confirmed patient with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), who was considered a super spreader, was staying at the hospital, he suspected having MERS infection [1] and voluntarily reported to health authorities. He thus became the 141st patient with confirmed diagnosis of MERS during the outbreak in South Korea after May 20, 2015 ( Figure 1 )."

Current Pharmaceutical Design Impact Factor: 2.611,"Recently, the risk of viral infection has dramatically increased owing to changes in human ecology such as global warming and an increased geographical movement of people and goods. However, the efficacy of vaccines and remedies for infectious diseases is limited by the high mutation rates of viruses, especially, RNA viruses. Here, we comprehensively review the effectiveness of several probiotics and paraprobiotics (sterilized probiotics) for the prevention or treatment of virally-induced infectious diseases. We discuss the unique roles of these agents in modulating the cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the mucosal immune system. In addition, we provide an overview of the unique mechanism by which viruses are eliminated through the stimulation of type 1 interferon production by probiotics and paraprobiotics via the activation of dendritic cells. Although further detailed research is necessary in the future, probiotics and/or paraprobiotics are expected to be among the rational adjunctive options for the treatment of various viral diseases.","Various strategies, such as those using vaccines and antibiotics, have been exploited for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, but infection control has not yet been achieved at a sufficient level. In addition to avian influenza [1] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [2] , and Ebola hemorrhagic fever [3] , many problematic diseases of tropical origin remain poorly controlled, such as dengue fever and Zika virus infection [4] ."
At the crossroads of autophagy and infection: Noncanonical roles for ATG proteins in viral replication,"Macroautophagy (autophagy) involves the formation of a double-membrane organelle called the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasmic components that are degraded upon its fusion with the lysosome (Stolz et al., 2014; Kaur and Debnath, 2015) . Studies in yeast have identified >30 autophagy-related (ATG) proteins, many of which have identified mammalian orthologues. The canonical process of autophagy begins with initiation at the phagophore assembly site, mediated by the UNC51-like kinase (ULK) complex, which is composed of the ATG proteins ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101. The ULK complex supports the activation of a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex consisting of Beclin 1 (ATG6), ATG14, and VPS34 to produce phosphatidylinositol triphosphate, which serves as the initial membrane mark recognized by early autophagic effector proteins. Phagophore membrane expansion is mediated by the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems involving multiple ATG proteins that ultimately lead to the lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), the mammalian orthologue of ATG8. LC3 is recognized by autophagy cargo receptors that promote the selective capture and engulfment of proteins, organelles, or microbes. The closed autophagosome is then trafficked to and fuses with the lysosome to degrade its cargo (Stolz et al., 2014; Kaur and Debnath, 2015) . ATG proteins traditionally have been studied for their roles in autophagosome formation and maturation, but we have recently begun to appreciate that they may have pleiotropic roles beyond autophagy (Bestebroer et al., 2013) . In this issue, through a comprehensive functional screen for ATG proteins in the control of viral replication, Mauthe et al. highlight the importance of the nontraditional functions of ATG proteins in the host viral response.","Macroautophagy (autophagy) involves the formation of a double-membrane organelle called the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasmic components that are degraded upon its fusion with the lysosome (Stolz et al., 2014; Kaur and Debnath, 2015) .

Cooperativity Enables Non-neutralizing Antibodies to Neutralize Ebolavirus HHS Public Access,"Drug combinations are synergistic when their combined efficacy exceeds the sum of the individual actions, but they rarely include ineffective drugs that become effective only in combination. We identified several ''enabling pairs'' of neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies, whose combination exhibited new functional profiles, including transforming a non-neutralizing antibody to a neutralizer. Sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies 2G4 or m8C4 enabled non-neutralizing antibody FVM09 (IC 50 >1 mM) to exhibit potent neutralization (IC 50 1-10 nM). While FVM09 or m8C4 alone failed to protect Ebola-virusinfected mice, a combination of the two antibodies provided 100% protection. Furthermore, nonneutralizers FVM09 and FVM02 exponentially enhanced the potency of two neu-tralizing antibodies against both Ebola and Sudan viruses. We identified a hotspot for the binding of these enabling antibody pairs near the interface of the glycan cap and GP2. Enabling cooperativity may","The 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) epidemic claimed over 11,000 lives, underscoring the need for effective therapeutics for this deadly virus and other members of the family Filoviridae that have caused human outbreaks in the past-Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus (MARV) (Rougeron et al., 2015) . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the filovirus glycoprotein (GP) are among the most promising countermeasures for filoviruses . Several studies have shown the superiority of specific combinations of mAbs targeting different EBOV GP epitopes compared to monotherapy (Olinger et al., 2012; Pettitt et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2012a Qiu et al., , 2012b Qiu et al., , 2014 . The combination of antibody therapy with adenovirus-expressed interferon (IFN)-α in nonhuman primates (NHPs) also resulted in enhanced efficacy (Qiu et al., 2013) . While these studies focused on EBOV-specific therapies, we recently targeted other ebolaviruses and demonstrated improved neutralization efficacy by combining several pan-ebo-lavirus therapeutic mAbs (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Howell et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015) . These findings indicate that the engagement of multiple antibodies through different protective mechanisms can be highly effective in controlling filovirus infection."
Effect of cadmium on the expression levels of interleukin-1α and interleukin-10 cytokines in human lung cells,"Cadmium is an environmentally hazardous metal, which causes toxicity in humans. Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl 2 compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl 2 concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl 2 concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl 2 affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.","Cadmium is a hazardous environmental pollutant with economic value, however no known biological function. It is an industrial toxicant, which has been classified as a type I carcinogen (1, 2) . It is a highly reactive metal and complexes with ligands to form different compounds, which affect numerous biological molecules and organs (3) . A significant quantity of cadmium is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic activities, including copper and nickel smelting, electroplating, galvanizing, nickel-cadmium battery production, welding, phosphate fertilizers, sewage sludge and cigarette smoke (3, 4) . The toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5, 6) . Cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7, 8) . Although the level of cadmium exposure to humans is low, it can accumulate and remain in the system for 15-30 years (9) (10) (11) , which is responsible for the toxicity in various organs. Cadmium molecular toxicity has been associated with various diseases, including tumor formation."
Costly Lessons From the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak in Korea,"Perspective Since the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) began on May 11, 2015, a total of 186 persons have been infected by the MERS coronavirus, 38 of whom have died. With this number, Korea becomes second only to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the ranking of cumulative MERS cases. In this paper Korea's unique experience of an outbreak of MERS will be summarized and discussed briefly.","Since the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) began on May 11, 2015, a total of 186 persons have been infected by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 38 of whom have died [1] .

A Universal Protein Tag for Delivery of SiRNA-Aptamer Chimeras,"siRNA-aptamer chimeras have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for targeted delivery of siRNA due to the modularity of their diblock RNA structure, relatively lower cost over other targeted delivery approaches, and, most importantly, the outstanding potential for clinical translation. However, additional challenges must be addressed for efficient RNA interference (RNAi), in particular, endosomal escape. Currently, vast majority of siRNA delivery vehicles are based on cationic materials, which form complexes with negatively charged siRNA. Unfortunately, these approaches complicate the formulations again by forming large complexes with heterogeneous sizes, unfavorable surface charges, colloidal instability, and poor targeting ligand orientation. Here, we report the development of a small and simple protein tag that complements the therapeutic and targeting functionalities of chimera with two functional domains: a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) for siRNA docking and a pH-dependent polyhistidine to disrupt endosomal membrane. The protein selectively tags along the siRNA block of individual chimera, rendering the overall size of the complex small, desirable for deep tissue penetration, and the aptamer block accessible for target recognition. More interestingly, we found that extending the c-terminal polyhistidine segment in the protein tag to 18 amino acids completely abolishes the RNA binding function of dsRBD. s iRNA is of considerable current interest because it can elicit potent, target-specific knockdown of virtually any mRNA, creating new opportunities for personalized medicine and for addressing a broad range of traditionally undruggable disease targets using small molecules 1-3 . Similar to other antisense approaches, however, cell-specific delivery of siRNA technology in vivo still represents a major technical hurdle 4 . To guide siRNA to diseased cells, targeting ligands such as small molecules, lipids, peptides, and proteins have been identified and linked directly to siRNA or on the surface of siRNA nanocarriers 5-10 . Considering the complex physical and chemical structures of various formulations, the siRNA-targeting ligand-delivery vehicle complexes face difficulty in large-scale production and regulatory approval for clinical uses.","final large complexes (typically 100 s nanometers) and the chemical composition of the nanocarriers can drastically change chimera's targeting profile, in vivo biodistribution, and clearance 23 . Furthermore, it is ideal to make the aptamer loop structure exposed and the siRNA block hidden for specific binding, but electrostatic condensation with cationic nanocarriers does not warrant that selectivity. As demonstrated previously, immobilizing siRNA-aptamer chimeras onto cationic nanoparticles via the siRNA end offers significantly improved silencing effect compared to condensing chimeras onto cationic nanoparticles through random sites 24 . This is understandable since (1) exposure of the siRNA end would only increase the chances of non-specific binding and reduce the stability siRNA against enzymatic degradation; and (2) interaction between cationic nanocarriers with anionic aptamers could alter aptamers' conformation and targeting capability 25 . Therefore, it is of critical importance to design a delivery system that is simple for potential regulatory approval and mass production, universal for all siRNAaptamer chimera, neutral and siRNA-binding specific to ensure aptamer targeting, and small to avoid major alteration of chimera's biodistribution profile. A system simultaneously achieving these features could expedite clinically translation of the highly promising siRNA-aptamer chimera technology."
Prolonged Detection of Japanese Encephalitis Virus in Urine and Whole Blood in a Returned Short-term Traveler,"We describe a fatal case of Japanese encephalitis virus infection following short-term travel to Thailand. Viral RNA was detected in urine and whole blood out to 26 and 28 days, respectively, after the onset of symptoms. Live virus was isolated from a urine specimen from day 14.","A previously well 69-year-old Australian man traveled to Thailand in early May 2017. The planned duration of travel was 12 days, and he did not attend a travel clinic prior to departure. The patient did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis, nor did he have a prior history of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccination. He flew to Phuket, before traveling north to the popular tourist destination of Khao Lak, where he stayed in a beachside holiday resort. Heavy rainfall occurred during the trip, which limited holiday activities. He did not travel to rural or remote areas, but did receive numerous mosquito bites. On the eighth day of travel, he became unwell with lethargy and generalized muscle aches. He flew to Bangkok on the ninth day of the trip, and over the following 3 days his symptoms included ongoing lethargy, poor appetite, and drenching sweats, but no headache, meningism, or confusion. He returned to Australia on day 12 of travel and was admitted to a regional hospital the following day, now the fifth day after symptoms commenced ( Figure 1 )."
Drawing on disorder: How viruses use histone mimicry to their advantage,"Humans carry trillions of viruses that thrive because of their ability to exploit the host. In this exploitation, viruses promote their own replication by suppressing the host antiviral response and by inducing changes in host biosynthetic processes, often with extremely small genomes of their own. In the review, we discuss the phenomenon of histone mimicry by viral proteins and how this mimicry allows the virus to dial in to the cell's transcriptional processes and establish a cell state that promotes infection. We suggest that histone mimicry is part of a broader viral strategy to use intrinsic protein disorder as a means to overcome the size limitations of its own genome and to maximize its impact on host protein networks. In particular, we discuss how intrinsic protein disorder may enable viral proteins to interfere with phase-separated host protein condensates, including those that contribute to chromatin-mediated control of gene expression.","Humans carry trillions of viruses that thrive because of their ability to exploit the host.

,"Objectives The safety and efficacy of the 3C-like protease inhibitor GC376 was tested on a cohort of client-owned cats with various forms of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Methods Twenty cats from 3.3-82 months of age (mean 10.4 months) with various forms of FIP were accepted into a field trial. Fourteen cats presented with wet or dry-to-wet FIP and six cats presented with dry FIP. GC376 was administered subcutaneously every 12 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Cats with neurologic signs were excluded from the study. Results Nineteen of 20 cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within 2 weeks of initial treatment. However, disease signs recurred 1-7 weeks after primary treatment and relapses and new cases were ultimately treated for a minimum of 12 weeks. Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1-7 weeks of initial or repeat treatment(s). Severe neurologic disease occurred in 8/13 cats that failed treatment and five cats had recurrences of abdominal lesions. At the time of writing, seven cats were in disease remission. Five kittens aged 3.3-4.4 months with wet FIP were treated for 12 weeks and have been in disease remission after stopping treatment and at the time of writing for 5-14 months (mean 11.2 months). A sixth kitten was in remission for 10 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment, relapsed and is responding to a second round of GC376. The seventh was a 6.8-year-old cat with only mesenteric lymph node involvement that went into remission after three relapses that required progressively longer repeat treatments over a 10 month period. Side effects of treatment included transient stinging upon injection and occasional foci of subcutaneous fibrosis and hair loss. There was retarded development and abnormal eruption of permanent teeth in cats treated before 16-18 weeks of age. Conclusions and relevance GC376 showed promise in treating cats with certain presentations of FIP and has opened the door to targeted antiviral drug therapy.","Drugs that directly inhibit virus replication have become mainstays in the treatment of chronic viral infections such as HIV/AIDS, 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV), 2 hepatitis B virus, herpesvirus and acute infections such as influenza. RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV possess ideal targets for virus inhibition such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and protease. Proteases are a particularly good target because they are involved in virus maturation (HIV) or production of functional viral proteins (HCV). Protease inhibitors are also used in combination with inhibitors of reverse transcription for HIV/AIDS for lifelong therapy, and combinations of different"
Brief Communication Clinical Microbiology Comparison of Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel and xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST Version 2 for the Detection of Respiratory Viruses,"Owing to advancements in molecular diagnostics, recent years have seen an increasing number of laboratories adopting respiratory viral panels to detect respiratory pathogens. In December 2015, the NxTAG respiratory pathogen panel (NxTAG RPP) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We compared the clinical performance of this new assay with that of the xTAG respiratory viral panel (xTAG RVP) FAST v2 using 142 clinical samples and 12 external quality assessment samples. Discordant results were resolved by using a laboratory-developed respiratory viral panel. The NxTAG RPP achieved 100% concordant negative results and 86.6% concordant positive results. It detected one coronavirus 229E and eight influenza A/H3N2 viruses that were missed by the xTAG RVP FAST v2. On the other hand, the NxTAG RPP missed one enterovirus/rhinovirus and one metapneumovirus that were detected by FAST v2. Both panels correctly identified all the pathogens in the 12 external quality assessment samples. Overall, the NxTAG RPP demonstrated good diagnostic performance. Of note, it was better able to subtype the influenza A/H3N2 viruses compared with the xTAG RVP FAST v2.

SURVEY AND SUMMARY Translational recoding: canonical translation mechanisms reinterpreted,"During canonical translation, the ribosome moves along an mRNA from the start to the stop codon in exact steps of one codon at a time. The collinearity of the mRNA and the protein sequence is essential for the quality of the cellular proteome. Spontaneous errors in decoding or translocation are rare and result in a deficient protein. However, dedicated recoding signals in the mRNA can reprogram the ribosome to read the message in alternative ways. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of three types of recoding events: stop-codon readthrough, -1 ribosome frameshifting and translational bypassing. Recoding events provide insights into alternative modes of ribosome dynamics that are potentially applicable to other non-canonical modes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.",Ribosomes produce proteins by translating the sequence of an mRNA into the amino acid sequence of a protein.
Comparison of fit factors among healthcare providers working in the Emergency Department Center before and after training with three types of N95 and higher filter respirators,"Introduction: N95 or higher filtering respirators have been recommended in healthcare settings, although there is still a risk of infection due to the improper selection and wearing of respirators. We aimed to assess the effects of training with N95 or higher filter respirators on the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers in the emergency medical center (EMC).","Healthcare providers are at risk of exposure to infectious diseases. In particular, as seen during the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak of South Korea in 2015, [1, 2] healthcare providers working in the emergency medical center (EMC) are at the forefront of exposure to infections by droplet or airborne transmission. During the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015, infections in the EMC accounted for 91 (49%) of the 186 hospital-related infections.

Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine Dovepress Glioblastoma extracellular vesicles: reservoirs of potential biomarkers,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and most devastating of the primary central nervous system tumors, with few patients living beyond 2 years postdiagnosis. The damage caused by the disease and our treatments for the patients often leave them physically and cognitively debilitated. Generally, GBMs appear after very short clinical histories and are discovered by imaging (using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the diagnosis is validated by pathology, following surgical resection. The treatment response and diagnosis of tumor recurrence are also tracked by MRI, but there are numerous problems encountered with these monitoring modalities, such as ambiguous interpretation and forms of pseudoprogression. Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers would be an immense boon in following treatment schemes and in determining recurrence, which often requires an invasive intracranial biopsy to verify imaging data. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are stable, membrane-enclosed, virussized particles released from either the cell surface or from endosomal pathways that lead to the systemic release of EVs into accessible biofluids, such as serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. EVs carry a wide variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites, with many common features but with enough individuality to be able to identify the cell of origin of the vesicles. These components, if properly interrogated, could allow for the identification of tumor-derived EVs in biofluids, indicating tumor progression, relapse, or treatment failure. That knowledge would allow clinicians to continue with treatment regimens that were actually effective or to change course if the therapies were failing. Here, we review the features of GBM EVs, in terms of EV content and activities that may lead to the use of EVs as serially accessible biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in neuro-oncology.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV glioma) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in the United States, striking some three in 100,000 people. Patients with GBM are faced with a poor prognosis as 5-year survival rates are less than 5% for all age groups (of those $75 years of age, virtually none are alive by that time). 1 Roughly 17, 000 Americans are diagnosed with GBM each year, and the disease claims ∼13,000 lives, with most succumbing in 1-2 years, despite gross total surgical resection, external beam radiation treatment, and the latest in multimodal chemotherapy. 2 These therapies are relatively nonspecific and come at significant cognitive and physiopsychological costs to the patient, as the brain is an organ that can not tolerate much collateral damage. Despite the relatively short time course of the disease, the financial burdens at a familial level, are staggering, 3 "
Measurability of the epidemic reproduction number in data-driven contact networks,"The basic reproduction number is one of the conceptual cornerstones of mathematical epidemiology. Its classical definition as the number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual in a fully susceptible population finds a clear analytical expression in homogeneous and stratified mixing models. Along with the generation time (the interval between primary and secondary cases), the reproduction number allows for the characterization of the dynamics of an epidemic. A clear-cut theoretical picture, however, is hardly found in real data. Here, we infer from highly detailed sociodemographic data two multiplex contact networks representative of a subset of the Italian and Dutch populations. We then simulate an infection transmission process on these networks accounting for the natural history of influenza and calibrated on empirical epidemiological data. We explicitly measure the reproduction number and generation time, recording all individual-level transmission events. We find that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number is untenable in realistic populations, and it does not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution. This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral changes and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered) contact structure of the population. Finally, we provide evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number can operationally be used to characterize the correct epidemic dynamics from incidence data. computational modeling | infectious diseases | multiplex networks | reproduction number | generation time","M athematical and computational models of infectious diseases are increasingly recognized as relevant quantitative support to epidemic preparedness and response (1) (2) (3) . Independent of the type of modeling approach, our understanding of epidemic models is generally tied to two fundamental concepts. One is the basic reproduction number R0, which is the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual over the entire course of the infectious period in a fully susceptible population (4) . The other is the generation time Tg, the time interval between the infection time of the infector and her/his infectees (5, 6) . These quantities are the cornerstones of our understanding of basic epidemic models, as they encompass the condition for the occurrence of an epidemic outbreak (R0 > 1) and the epidemic doubling time. Both the reproduction number and generation time are determined by the biological characteristics of the pathogen (e.g., probability of transmission given a contact), the pathogen-host system (e.g., timeline of pathogen replication inside the host), and the contact patterns of the population in which the infection spreads (4, 7) . The concept of the reproduction number has been extended to stratified models (8) and to heterogeneous contact networks (9) to account for more complex interaction patterns. Furthermore, the definition of R0 has been generalized by the effective reproduction number R(t) (i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual at time t), thus relaxing the hypothesis of a fully susceptible population (10) ."
Clinical risk factors associated with the develop ment of wheezing in children less than 2 years of age who required hospitalization for viral lower respiratory tract infections,"Purpose: Wheezing following viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children <2 years of age is an important risk factor for the development of asthma later in life; however, not all children with viral LRTIs develop wheezing. This study investigated risk factors for the development of wheezing during viral LRTIs requiring hospitalization. Methods: The study included 142 children <2 years of age hospitalized for LRTIs with at least one virus identified as the cause and classified them into children diagnosed with LRTIs with wheezing (n=70) and those diagnosed with LRTIs without wheezing (n=72). Results: There were no significant differences in the viruses detected between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for potentially confounding variables including sex and age, the development of wheezing was strongly associated with parental history of allergic diseases (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 20.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.22-126.48), past history of allergic diseases (aOR, 13.95; 95% CI, 1.34-145.06), past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (aOR, 21.36; 95% CI, 3.77-120.88), exposure to secondhand smoke at home (aOR, 14.45; 95% CI, 4.74-44.07), and total eosinophil count (aOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02). Conclusion: Past and parental history of allergic diseases, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, exposure to secondhand smoke at home, and total eosinophil count were closely associated with the development of wheezing in children <2 years of age who required hospitalization for viral LRTIs. Clinicians should take these factors into consideration when treating, counseling, and monitoring young children admitted for viral LRTIs.",Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are common in early childhood and are mostly caused by respiratory viruses. Wheezing caused by viruses is considered an important risk factor for the development of asthma later in life [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .
A Deep Nasopharyngeal Swab Versus Nonendoscopic Bronchoalveolar Lavage for Isolation of Bacterial Pathogens from Preweaned Calves With Respiratory Disease,Background: Nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a practical alternative for a deep nasopharyngeal swab (DNS) to sample the airways of a large number of calves in a short period of time. The extent of commensal overgrowth and agreement of BAL with DNS culture results in preweaned calves are unknown.,"B ovine respiratory disease (BRD) has major economic impact in cattle production systems worldwide. 1 It is the main indication for antimicrobial use in calves and therefore receives considerable attention in countries in which veterinary use of antimicrobials is in question. 2 To rationalize antimicrobial use, veterinary formularies have been established in several European countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. These formularies recommend sampling of the respiratory tract, bacterial isolation, and susceptibility testing before certain antimicrobial classes, critical for human medicine, can be used. 3 Recently, a change in Belgian law has been made, requiring an antibiogram before fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins can be used. 4 However, to date, there is no consensus on how the respiratory tract should be sampled to isolate causative pathogens."
EMBO (Eur,"The glycoprotein gp210 is located in the ""pore membrane,"" a specialized domain of the nuclear envelope to which the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is anchored, gp210 contains a large cisternal domain, a single transmembrane segment (TM), and a COOHterminal, 58-amino acid residue cytoplasmic tail (CT) ).

The large cisternal domain of gp210 (95% of its mass) did not reveal any sorting determinants. Surprisingly, the TM of gp210 is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The CT also contains a sorting determinant, but it is weaker than that of the TM. We propose specific lateral association of the transmembrane helices of two proteins to yield either a gp210 homodimer or a heterodimer of gp210 and another protein. The cytoplasmically oriented tails of these dimers may bind cooperatively to the adjacent NPCs. In addition, we demonstrate that gp210 co-localizes with cytoplasmically dispersed nucleoporins, suggesting a cytoplasmic association of these components. T hE nuclear envelope (NE) ~ consists of three morphologically and biochemically distinct domains (for review see 9, 12) . The outer nuclear membrane domain contains bound ribosomes and is continuous with and biochemically indistinguishable from the RER. The inner nuclear membrane domain is adjacent to the nuclear lamina and the underlying chromatin, and contains a distinct set of integral membrane proteins (1, 29, 36) . Finally, the outer and inner membranes of the NE are connected with each other at numerous sites forming circular openings in the NE (nuclear pores) of ""~100 nm diam. The connecting membrane is sharply bent (180~ and is referred to as the ""pore membrane"" domain of the NE. The nuclear pore is occupied by the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the pore membrane is adjacent to the NPC (for review see 9, 21) . The pore membrane contains at least one distinct glycoprotein, referred to as gp210 (10, 37) .

Prevalence and genetic characteristics of Saffold cardiovirus in China from 2009 to 2012,"The epidemiology and clinical features of the Saffold cardiovirus (SAFV) remain ambiguous. The present study was designed to systematically and intensively investigate the epidemiological features of SAFV in pediatric patients in China. Three cohorts of pediatric patients were recruited from 2009 to 2012. Cohort 1 comprised patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Cohort 2 comprised patients with diarrhea. Cohort 3 comprised hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) patients. A total of 115 patients (1.6%) among 6052 (17/1647, 12/2013, and 86/2392 in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were SAFV-positive. The samples from 82 SAFV-positive patients were successfully sequenced, and four genotypes were identified: 8 SAFV-1, 41 SAFV-2, 29 SAFV-3, and 4 SAFV-6. A significantly higher detection rate was found in the HFMD patients than in other two cohorts (both P ,0.001). A higher frequency of severe clinical outcome and nervous system manifestation were also observed in the SAFV-positive HFMD patients. Additionally, 6 (3.5%) cerebrospinal fluid and 7 (2.2%) serum samples from the HFMD-associated encephalitis patients were SAFV-positive. Based on the VP1 sequences, all four genotypes displayed distinct geographical clustering. SAFV infection might be associated with a wide clinical spectrum and contribute to HFMD.","myocardium of a previously healthy child who experienced sudden death, suggesting that the virus might cause serious invasive infection in children 25 ."
"US-Like Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Outbreaks in Taiwan, 2013-2014","Since late 2013, several outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have emerged in Taiwan. Suckling piglets under 2 weeks of age showed severe vomiting and watery yellowish diarrhea with morbidity and mortality ranging from 80 to 100% and 90 to 100%, respectively. A total of 68 samples from 25 pig farms were confirmed as positive for PEDV and negative for rotavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus by reverse transcription PCR, and the partial S gene of PEDV was analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis places all 18 Taiwanese PEDV isolates collected during this outbreak in the same clade as the US strains of PEDV. This novel PEDV is prevailing and currently causing severe outbreaks in Taiwan.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) are enveloped viruses with a large, capped and polyadenylated RNA genome of approximately 28,000 nucleotides [6] . PEDVs belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. Other members of this subgroup include human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, HCoV NL63 and Bats coronavirus 512/05 [8] . Although PEDV was first identified in Europe, it has become increasingly problematic in many Asian countries [6] and North America [7] . However, there is no retrospective study on the emergence of PEDV in Taiwan. Pigs of all ages can be affected and can exhibit degrees of diarrhea and loss of appetite, which vary according to age. In suckling piglets that exhibit watery diarrhea, dehydration with milk curd vomitus and thin-walled intestines with severe villus atrophy and congestion, PEDVs are associated with disease. The disease can progress to death within a few days. The outbreak is distinguished by a nearly 100% prevalence of illness among piglets after birth and death rates of 80-100%. Boars and sows with mild diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia for a few days were reported to recover within a week [6, 7] ."
"Open Forum Infectious Diseases ® Clinical Features, Severity, and Incidence of RSV Illness During 12 Consecutive Seasons in a Community Cohort of Adults ≥60 Years Old",Background. The epidemiology and burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness are not well defined in older adults. Methods. Adults ≥60 years old seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory illness were recruited from 2004-2005 through 2015-2016 during the winter seasons. RSV was identified from respiratory swabs by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were ascertained by interview and medical record abstraction. The incidence of medically attended RSV was estimated for each seasonal cohort.,"Over the past decade, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been increasingly recognized as an important cause of acute respiratory illness in older adults. Both influenza and RSV account for a substantial number of respiratory illness deaths among adults ≥65 years of age in the United States. From 1997 to 2009, influenza and RSV contributed to approximately 28 000 and 17 000 annual cardiorespiratory deaths, respectively [1] . RSV is also an important cause of adult respiratory illness in both developed and developing countries, including tropical and subtropical regions [2] [3] [4] . Studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s first identified RSV as a cause of acute respiratory illness in a variety of adult populations, including older adults, working-age adults, hospitalized patients, and residents of long-term care facilities [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Immunocompromised adults and those with advanced age and/or cardiopulmonary disease are at especially high risk for severe complications from RSV infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ."
"Yuichi OTA 4) , Yoshihito AKABANE 5)","Since there is no available serological methods to detect antibodies to ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant partial nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the ferret coronavirus (FRcoV) Yamaguchi-1 strain was developed to establish a serological method for detection of FRcoV infection. Many serum samples collected from ferrets recognized both a.a. 1-179 and a.a. 180-374 of the N protein, but two serum samples did not a.a. 180-374 of the N protein. This different reactivity was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the serum from the ferret.Therefore, the a.a. 1-179 of the N protein was used as an ELISA antigen. Serological test was carried out using sera or plasma of ferrets in Japan. Surprisingly, 89% ferrets in Japan had been infected with FRcoV. These results indicated that our established ELISA using a.a. 1-179 of the N protein is useful for detection of antibody to FRcoV for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of FRcoV infection. KEY WORDS: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), nucleocapsid (N)","Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (EcE), a new enteric disease of domestic ferrets (Mustelo putorius furo), was first described in the United States in the early 1990s [11] . A novel alphacoronavirus, ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), was detected as the causative agent of EcE in 2000 and designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FREcV) [11, 12] . Ferrets with EcE show general clinical signs including lethargy, anorexia and vomiting, and characteristic signs with foul-smelling, green mucous-laden diarrhea [12] . FRcoV was also reported as the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like disease in 2006, and the virus was designated as ferret systemic coronavirus (FRScV) [2] [3] [4] . Ferrets with FIP-like disease show characteristic clinical signs of large palpable intraabdominal masses like dry type of FIP [2] [3] [4] . FRcoVs were divided into two genotypes, I and II, based on differences in the spike (S) gene, and it was suggested that genotype I was associated with FIP-like disease and genotype II was with EcE [13] . However, we previously showed that there was no significant relationship between the genotypes of FRCoV and disease in Japan [9] . In addition, genotype I FRcoV was also detected from many asymptomatic ferrets in the Netherlands [6] . The relationship between genotypes of FRcoV and clinical symptoms remains unclear."
Metagenomic Sequencing of an Echovirus 30 Genome From Cerebrospinal Fluid of a Patient With Aseptic Meningitis and Orchitis,"Enteroviruses cause a wide spectrum of clinical disease.

Clinicopathological Phenotype of Autosomal Recessive Cholesterol Deficiency in Holstein Cattle,"Background: Cholesterol deficiency (CD), a newly identified autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein cattle, is associated with clinical signs of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypocholesterolemia.","A n inherited autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein calves, named cholesterol deficiency (CD), was reported for the first time in the summer of 2015 in Germany. 1, 2 Homozygous calves demonstrate clinical signs of diarrhea unresponsive to treatment and failure to thrive. 1 They suffer marked hypocholesterolemia and hypolipidemia, indicating an inherited fat metabolism disorder. These animals usually die within the first 6 months of life, and it has been assumed that about 80% of homozygous affected calves do not survive more than 1 year. 1 Heterozygous carrier animals do not show any clinical signs but have reduced levels of blood cholesterol and triglycerides. 1 Breeding organizations in Switzerland and other countries have reported an increasing occurrence of cases in Holstein cattle. The causal mutation has recently been identified in the apolipoprotein B gene (APOB). 3 A 1,299-bp insertion of a transposable element located in exon 5 of bovine APOB was shown to be perfectly associated with the disease and leads to truncated transcripts and aberrant splicing. 3 The Canadian artificial insemination Holstein sire Maughlin Storm, born in 1991, has been identified genetically to be the first carrier bull. 2 A significant recent advancement has been the development of a PCR-based direct gene test, allowing the detection of animals with CD without pedigree information. 3 In human patients, truncating mutations in APOB give rise to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL). The APOB encodes 2 proteins via a mRNA-editing process: the APOB-48 protein is required for chylomicron production in the small intestine, and the APOB-100 protein is expressed in the liver. The APOB-100 protein is a structural component of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its metabolic products and serves as the ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipid particles. 4 The clinical consequences of the mutation are well described in human medicine, but have not been described to date in cattle. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical and pathological phenotype associated with the genetic defect of APOB causing this new disease entity in Holstein cattle."
Modulation of nasopharyngeal innate defenses by viral coinfection predisposes individuals to experimental pneumococcal carriage,"Increased nasopharyngeal colonization density has been associated with pneumonia. We used experimental human pneumococcal carriage to investigate whether upper respiratory tract viral infection predisposes individuals to carriage. A total of 101 healthy subjects were screened for respiratory virus before pneumococcal intranasal challenge. Virus was associated with increased odds of colonization (75% virus positive became colonized vs. 46% virus-negative subjects; P ¼ 0.02). Nasal Factor H (FH) levels were increased in virus-positive subjects and were associated with increased colonization density. Using an in vitro epithelial model we explored the impact of increased mucosal FH in the context of coinfection. Epithelial inflammation and FH binding resulted in increased pneumococcal adherence to the epithelium. Binding was partially blocked by antibodies targeting the FH-binding protein Pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC). PspC epitope mapping revealed individuals lacked antibodies against the FH binding region. We propose that FH binding to PspC in vivo masks this binding site, enabling FH to facilitate pneumococcal/epithelial attachment during viral infection despite the presence of anti-PspC antibodies. We propose that a PspC-based vaccine lacking binding to FH could reduce pneumococcal colonization, and may have enhanced protection in those with underlying viral infection.","Secondary bacterial infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae are a major cause of morbidity and mortality during pandemic influenza. 1 Pneumococcus commonly colonizes the upper respiratory tract (URT) in healthy individuals but viral infections transform this normally harmless commensal organism into a potentially fatal pathogen by increasing pneumococcal transmission, 2 carriage density, 3, 4 and host disease susceptibility. 5 The current threat of influenza pandemics, increasing antibiotic resistance, and the burden of coinfection in the young and aged populations make it critical to understand how viral infection increases susceptibility to pneumococcal disease."
Characterization of the Budding Compartment of Mouse Hepatitis Virus: Evidence That Transport from the RER to the Golgi Complex Requires only One Vesicular Transport Step,"Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) buds into pleomorphic membrane structures with features expected of the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi complex. Here, we characterize the MHV budding compartment in more detail in mouse L cells using streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilization which allowed us to better visualize the membrane structures at the ER-Golgi boundary. The MHV budding compartment shares membrane continuities with the rough ER as well as with cisternal elements on one side of the Golgi stack. It also labeled with p58 and rab2, two markers of the intermediate compartment, and with PDI, usually considered to be a marker of the rough ER. The membranes of the budding compartment, as well as the budding virions themselves, but not the rough ER, labeled with the N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc)-specific lectin Helix pomatia. When the SLO-permeabilized cells were treated with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP',/S), the budding compartment accumulated a",large number of ~-cop-containing buds and vesicular profiles.
"VaccHemInf project: protocol for a prospective cohort study of efficacy, safety and characterisation of immune functional response to vaccinations in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients on behalf of the Lyon HEMINF Study Group","Introduction Immune reconstitution after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a complex and dynamic process, varying from a state of nearly complete immunosuppression to an expected full immune recovery. Specific vaccination guidelines recommend reimmunisation after HSCT but data regarding vaccine efficacy in this unique population are scarce. New immune functional assays could enable prediction of vaccine response in the setting of HSCT. Methods and analysis A prospective, longitudinal single-centre cohort study of autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients was designed in order to determine the vaccine response to five vaccine targets (pneumococcus, hepatitis B virus, Haemophilus Influenzae type b, tetanus and diphtheria) and to correlate it to immune function parameters. A workflow was set up to study serological response to vaccines and to describe the functional immune status of 100 HSCT recipients (50 autologous and 50 allogeneic) before and 3, 12 and 24 months after primary immunisation. At each time point, 'basic' immune status recording (serology, immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry) will be assessed. The immune response will furthermore be evaluated before and 3 months after primary vaccination by two ex vivo immune functional assays assessing: (1) tumour necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma production and host messenger RNA expression on whole-blood stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B and (2) T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to a standard mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin) or to selected recall antigens. Reference intervals will be determined from a cohort of 30 healthy volunteers.

Transferrin Receptor Mediates Uptake and Presentation of Hepatitis B Envelope Antigen by T Lymphocytes,"Human activated T lymphocytes expressing dass II molecules are able to present only complex antigens that bind to their own surface receptors, and thus can be captured, internalized, and processed through the class II major histocompatibility complex processing pathway. We have used the antigen-presenting T cell system to identify the viral receptor used by hepatitis B virus (HBV) to enter cells, as well as the sequence of HB envelope antigen (HBenvAg) involved in this interaction. Results show that both CD4 + and CD8 + T clones can process and present HBenvAg to class II-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and that the CD71 transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in efficient HBenvAg uptake by T cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the HBenvAg sequence interacting with the T cell surface is contained within the pre-S2 region. Since TfR is also expressed on hepatocytes, it might represent a portal of cellular entry for HBV infection. This system of antigen presentation by T cells may serve as a model to study both lymphocyte receptors used by lymphocytotropic viruses and viral proteins critical to bind them.","C D4 T lymphocytes recognize exogenous antigens as peptides bound to class II MHC molecules expressed on the surface of APC, generally represented by macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells (1, 2) .

Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Dovepress Frequency of tuberculosis among diabetic patients in the People's Republic of China,"The People's Republic of China has nearly the highest incidence of both diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. DM increases the risk of TB by two to three times and adversely affects TB treatment outcomes. The increasing epidemic of DM in the People's Republic of China is due to decreased physical activity, unhealthy diet, and obesity. Over the last 20 years, the excellent free China National Tuberculosis Program has been set up, and the ""DOTS"" (directly observed treatment + short-course chemotherapy) model for TB control has successfully reduced the burden of TB, but the disease is still a considerable problem. Given the high burden of TB and DM in the People's Republic of China and the relationship between the two diseases, it is sensible to screen DM patients for TB. A bidirectional screening of the two diseases was conducted in the People's Republic of China from 2011 to 2012, which identified a TB incidence in patients with DM of about 958 per 100,000. Here, we report the findings of our recent study on the incidence of TB among diabetic patients in the People's Republic of China. The data agree with those of previous reports.","The incidences of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) are increasing, representing a serious threat to human longevity and health. Further, the prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and overall health hazards have increased in recent years. The number of DM patients worldwide has been estimated at about 347 million, 1 with about 7 million of those classified as new cases; additionally, up to 2008, 3.9 million people had died from DM, with 80% of the deaths occurring in low-and middleincome countries. 2 It is expected that by 2025, the number of patients with DM in India, the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and Mexico will increase by 200%, and the number of patients with DM in India and the People's Republic of China will account for one-third of the total number of patients with DM worldwide. By 2030, the estimated number of DM patients will be about 438 million according to the current rate of growth, with 80% of new DM patients living in developing countries. Frighteningly, the World Health Organization (WHO) projects that DM will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. 3 The WHO declared TB a ""global health emergency"" in 1993, and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a global plan to stop TB that aims to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015. 4 A number of targets they have set are not likely to be achieved by 2015, largely due to the increase in DM-associated TB and the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 5 This article was published in the following Dove Press journal: Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management Although TB was once effectively controlled, the incidence in many countries rebounded in the 1980s and it has again become a major disease threatening public health. In addition to cases with typical symptoms, the number of nontypical TB cases is increasing significantly, and these are often associated with a chronic dry cough (pulmonary tuberculosis [PTB] ) and chronic hoarseness (laryngeal TB). 6 Patients with nontypical TB symptoms often consult with otolaryngologists; therefore, doctors from all departments should be well aware of all possible symptoms of TB and should know that patients with DM are at a high risk of TB 7 and that TB can increase the occurrence and development of DM. 8 More attention is being paid to the coexistence of these two diseases by investigators, public health organizations, governments, and policy makers."
Valuable hematological indicators for the diagnosis and severity assessment of Chinese children with community-acquired pneumonia,"Chest X-ray is a ""golden standard"" for the diagnosis and severity assessment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, it cannot be used as routine examination of CAP in children. The present study aims to investigate the roles of prealbumin (PA) in CAP in children and further determine the usefulness of PA in diagnosis and severity assessment of CAP in children.","The respiratory infections in children are classified as upper respiratory infections and lower respiratory infections (LRI) based on the site of infection. In LRI, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the major cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality in children, which can be defined as symptoms of pneumonia caused by community acquired infection without predisposing factors in previous healthy children. CAP is one of the most common diseases in children, and also second leading cause of death for children in developing countries. In addition, CAP is one of the most common causes of hospitalization among developed countries. The incidence of CAP is 10 to 40/10,000 for children under 5 years of age and 11 to 16/10,000 for children between the age of 5 and 14 years. [1, 2] Although the clinical manifestations of fever and respiratory symptoms are recommended for the diagnosis of CAP, chest X-ray is still the ""golden standard"" for the diagnosis and severity assessment. Since it has been suggested that chest X-ray should not be used as routine examination of CAP in children, [3] it is necessary to find new serum markers to replace chest X-ray in order to determine the lung involvement and stratify the children, and further decide whether it is necessary to perform radiological examination."

We have examined the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on the Golgi-localized synthesis and addition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate side chains . BFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation onto the core proteins of the melanoma-associated proteoglycan and the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain . In the presence of BFA, the melanoma proteoglycan core protein was retained in the ER but still acquired complex, sialylated, N-linked oligosaccharides, as measured by digestion with endoglycosidase H and neuraminidase. The initiation of glycosaminoglycan syn-xE biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)' carbohydrate side chains involves an extensive series of posttranslational enzymatic reactions that occur dur ing the intracellular transport of core proteins from the ER through the Golgi complex . These reactions use specific initiation, elongation, and sulfation enzymes to modify appropriate core proteins and assemble them into mature proteoglycan molecules . For chondroitin sulfate (CS) GAGS, the carbohydrate-protein linkage region is initiated by a xylosyltransferase that transfers xylose from UDP-xylose to the hydroxyl groups of specific serine residues within a core protein. Initiation is completed by the addition oftwo galactosyl and one glucuronosyl residue through the action of galactosyltransferase I, II, and glucuronosyltransferase I, respectively. Once initiated, the repeating disaccharide backbone ofglucuronosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues is elongated by specific glucuronosyland N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases . Sulfation of the repeating disaccharides by the 4-and/or 6-sulfotransferases completes the synthesis of mono-or disulfated CS (27) (see Fig . 11 for summary) ."
Immune complex glomerulonephritis of suspected iatrogenic origin in five Japanese Black calves,"Five Japanese Black embryo transfer calves from a single embryo flush, 30 to 45-daysold, including 4 live animals for clinical examination and 1 dead for necropsy, were presented with a history of decreased milk intake and hypoproteinemia. Consistent clinicopathological abnormalities in the 4 calves presented for clinical evaluation included hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, increased creatine phosphokinase activity, and proteinuria. Four calves ultimately were necropsied and all had histologic evidence of immune complex glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in these calves was hypothesized to have resulted from the interaction of passively acquired antibodies at birth and active immunization at 7 and 28 days of age with a Salmonella Typhimurium core antigen vaccine.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms.17-0544 like activity.

Dual priming oligonucleotide system for the multiplex detection of respiratory viruses and SNP genotyping of CYP2C19 gene,"Successful PCR starts with proper priming between an oligonucleotide primer and the template DNA. However, the inevitable risk of mismatched priming cannot be avoided in the currently used primer system, even though considerable time and effort are devoted to primer design and optimization of reaction conditions. Here, we report a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) which contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure which itself is not involved in priming, but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5 0 -segment that initiates stable priming, and a short 3 0 -segment that determines targetspecific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool for blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates, and thereby generates consistently high PCR specificity even under less than optimal PCR conditions. The strength and utility of the DPO system are demonstrated here using multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR.","Since the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a variety of modifications in primer design and reaction conditions have been proposed to enhance and optimize specificity (1-3), but a fundamental solution for eliminating non-specific priming still remains a challenge and limits the versatility of PCR in nucleic-acid-based tests (NATs). Achieving a high level of specificity in priming currently requires very rigid primer search parameters and optimization of PCR conditions. Even when these requirements are satisfied, a high risk of nonspecific priming is inevitable."

Respiratory failure in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient,"The number of patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is rapidly rising worldwide. Despite substantial improvements in peri-transplant care, pulmonary complications resulting in respiratory failure remain a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the post-transplant period, and represent a major barrier to the overall success of HSCT. Infectious complications include pneumonia due to bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and most commonly occur during neutropenia in the early post-transplant period. Non-infectious complications include idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, periengraftment respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. These complications have distinct clinical features and risk factors, occur at differing times following transplant, and contribute to morbidity and mortality.","Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is in creasingly utilized worldwide for definitive treatment of hematologic malignancy and other conditions, with over 50000 transplants performed annually [1] . During HSCT, patients undergo high dose conditioning chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with a view to eradicate their immune system along with any residual malignant cells. Stem cells are collected beforehand and are administered after conditioning is complete to reconstitute the immune system. HSCT may be autologous (where the donor stem cells are the patient's own) or allogeneic (where the donor stem cells are from an appropriately matched donor)."
ARTICLE miRNomes of haematopoietic stem cells and dendritic cells identify miR-30b as a regulator of Notch1,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical to initiate the immune response and maintain tolerance, depending on different status and subsets. The expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various DC subsets and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which generate DCs, remain to be fully identified. Here we examine miRNomes of mouse bone marrow HSCs, immature DCs, mature DCs and IL-10/NO-producing regulatory DCs by deep sequencing. We identify numerous stage-specific miRNAs and histone modification in HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages. miR-30b, significantly upregulated via a TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated epigenetic pathway in regulatory DCs, can target Notch1 to promote IL-10 and NO production, suggesting that miR-30b is a negative regulator of immune response. We also identify miRNomes of in vivo counterparts of mature DCs and regulatory DCs and systematically compare them with DCs cultured in vitro. These results provide a resource for studying roles of miRNAs in stem cell biology, development and functional regulation of DC subsets.","D endritic cells (DCs), the most potent professional antigenpresenting cells, are crucial for the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses and also important in maintaining immune tolerance to self-tissues 1 . Together with all blood cells, DCs have their ultimate origin in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs have the capacity to self-renew over the lifespan and also to give rise to a series of precursor cells that are progressively committed to particular cell lineages 2 . Which precursor type will actually generate DCs will depend on the availability of precursors and the immune microenvironment involved 3 . In most circumstances, myeloid precursors are the main sources to generate DCs. DCs comprise a network of subsets that differ in location, migratory pathways, detailed immunological function and dependence on stimuli for their generation, adding further layers of complexity in the coordination of immune responses 4 . The developmental pathways that lead HSCs to the different DC subsets are very important, not just in the initial establishment of the DC network, but as dynamic components of the response to microbial invasion and the maintenance of immune homeostasis 5 . Although the development and differentiation pathways have been simply mapped and much knowledge has been gained about the origins, phenotypes and functions of mouse DC subsets, examining the mechanisms of gene regulation that underlie development from HSCs to different DC subsets has the potential to improve our understanding of cell differentiation in general and to provide insights for the development of clinically relevant DC-based immunotherapy."
Emerging roles of interferon-stimulated genes in the innate immune response to hepatitis C virus infection,"Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major viral cause of chronic liver disease, frequently progresses to steatosis and cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection strongly induces host responses, such as the activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy and the innate immune response. Upon HCV infection, the host induces the interferon (IFN)-mediated frontline defense to limit virus replication. Conversely, HCV employs diverse strategies to escape host innate immune surveillance. Type I IFN elicits its antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these ISGs participate in IFN-mediated anti-HCV actions remain largely unknown. In this review, we first outline the signaling pathways known to be involved in the production of type I IFN and ISGs and the tactics that HCV uses to subvert innate immunity. Then, we summarize the effector mechanisms of scaffold ISGs known to modulate IFN function in HCV replication. We also highlight the potential functions of emerging ISGs, which were identified from genome-wide siRNA screens, in HCV replication. Finally, we discuss the functions of several cellular determinants critical for regulating host immunity in HCV replication. This review will provide a basis for understanding the complexity and functionality of the pleiotropic IFN system in HCV infection. Elucidation of the specificity and the mode of action of these emerging ISGs will also help to identify novel cellular targets against which effective HCV therapeutics can be developed.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 170 million people worldwide and represents a heavy burden to global health, with the highest prevalence rates found in Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. 1 Acute HCV infection is asymptomatic, and in 70% of infected individuals, the virus persists and progresses to chronic liver diseases, including fibrosis, steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 2, 3 Furthermore, HCV is a major cause of type I mixed cryoglobulinemia, which occurs in 10% of patients. 4 Using the HCV genotype 2a isolate Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1 genome-based cell culture-derived infectious HCV (HCVcc), 5 Zhong et al. 6 demonstrated that HCV and cells coevolve in vitro during chronically persistent infection, which involves the selection of viral mutants with increased infectivity and cells with resistance to viral entry and/or RNA replication. In this coevolution process, HCV exhibits multifaceted interactions with the host cells, and these cellular stress responses subsequently affect virus replication. For instance, infection with HCVcc or expression of the Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1 genome has been shown to trigger cytopathic effects, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy and the innate immune response. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In the competition between this virus and host cells, viral infection often triggers a first-line host defense through the production of type I interferon (IFN), which is a broadly acting antiviral cytokine, and inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines confer an antiviral state on the host cells, thereby interfering with viral replication. 15, 16 With the ability to enhance the immune response for virus clearance or to inhibit viral replication, IFN-based therapies have been used to treat HCVinfected patients for over two decades. 17 To guard against viral infection, the host cell has developed multiple restriction strategies to limit viral infection. The expression of many of these restriction factors is subject to transcriptional regulation by IFN. 13, 14 Upon infection by viruses such as HCV, viral RNA is first sensed by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and the PRR-mediated recruitment of adaptor proteins and the activation of downstream signaling lead to IFN production. 16, 18, 19 After binding to its receptor (IFNAR) complex present on the cell surface, IFN triggers the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway to drive the synthesis of over 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which block virus replication at different phases of the virus replication cycle. [19] [20] [21] [22] These ISGs are usually not synthesized at the basal state, but are induced to express and mediate the antiviral effector functions of IFN upon viral infection or IFN treatment."
Human LAP + GARP + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells attenuate xenogeneic graft versus host disease,"Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (FOXP3 + Tregs) has been developed as a potential curative immune therapy to prevent and treat autoimmune and graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD). A major limitation that has hindered the use of Treg immunotherapy in humans is the difficulty of consistently isolating and obtaining highly purified Tregs after ex vivo expansion. Methods: We isolated bona fide Tregs from expansion cultures based on their selective surface expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP). The TCR Vβ diversity and intracellular cytokine production of Tregs were determined by flow cytometer. The TSDR methylation was determined by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay. Their in vitro and in vivo potency was confirmed with suppression assay and humanized xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD) murine model, respectively. Results: LAP + repurification results in >90% LAP + FOXP3 + Tregs, leaving behind FOXP3 − and FOXP3 + nonTregs within the LAP − population. After 4-week expansion, the LAP + Tregs were >1 billion cells, highly suppressive and anergic in vitro, >90% demethylated in the TSDR and able to maintain TCR Vβ diversity. In the xGVHD model, exogenous CD25 − PBMC administered alone results in a median survival of 32 days. The co-transfer of LAP + Tregs increased median survival to 47 days, while the LAP parent (CD25 + ) and LAP − nonTregs had median survival of 39 and 31 days, respectively. Conclusions: These preclinical data together provide evidence that LAP + Tregs are highly purified with fully suppressive function for cell therapy. This population results in a more effective and safer product for immunotherapy to treat GVHD and provides the necessary preclinical data for transition into a clinical trial with LAP + Tregs to prevent or treat GVHD and other autoimmune diseases.","FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4 + T cells, maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity by suppressing auto-reactivity and regulating immune responses to foreign and self-antigens [1] . A hallmark of Tregs is their expression of the transcription factor, FOXP3, and the high level of CD25, the IL2 receptor alpha chain [2] . Due to their role in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, Tregs have been considered as potentially immunotherapy to prevent a variety of immunological diseases in human. Among potential diseases that may be tackled with such immune-modulators are most graft versus host disease (GVHD), a frequent and often severe complication following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [3] . Murine studies have demonstrated convincing evidence of the power of Tregs as a cell therapy to prevent and treat various Ivyspring International Publisher immunological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease and lupus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In translating these studies to human therapeutic applications, one major limitation is the expansion of Tregs ex vivo to achieve consistently sufficient number and purity of bona fide Tregs. In the peripheral blood of healthy adults, there are ~5-10% FOXP3 + Tregs within total CD4 + T cells. Since FOXP3 is an intracellular transcription factor, only the CD4 + T cells with low CD127 and high CD25 expression, i.e., no more than 2-4% can be sorted to functionally isolate >90% FOXP3 purity. However, this population is not homogeneously Tregs, particularly in diseases where these markers are less correlative due to activated T cells. It has been established that there are two subsets of Tregs: those developed in the thymus (tTregs) and those generated in the periphery (pTregs). Moreover, naïve CD4 + T cells can be induced in vitro with TCR stimulation in the presence of TGFβ1 and IL2 to express FOXP3 (iTregs) [11] . The functional patterns for these different subgroups of Tregs are widely varying during the expansion of Tregs over a [3] [4] week period. In addition, the purity and composition of Tregs frequencies with respect to tTregs, iTregs, pTregs and CD4 + FOXP3 − nonTregs are also varying, resulting in an impure Treg product."
"Genomics and Proteomics of Mycobacteriophage Patience, an Accidental Tourist in the Mycobacterium Neighborhood","Newly emerging human viruses such as Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and HIV likely originate within an extant population of viruses in nonhuman hosts and acquire the ability to infect and cause disease in humans. Although several mechanisms preventing viral infection of particular hosts have been described, the mechanisms and constraints on viral host expansion are ill defined. We describe here mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage recovered using Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2 155 as a host. Patience has genomic features distinct from its M. smegmatis host, including a much lower GC content (50.3% versus 67.4%) and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in M. smegmatis. Nonetheless, it propagates well in M. smegmatis, and we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to show expression of over 75% of the predicted proteins, to identify new genes, to refine the genome annotation, and to estimate protein abundance. We propose that Patience evolved primarily among lower-GC hosts and that the disparities between its genomic profile and that of M. smegmatis presented only a minimal barrier to host expansion. Rapid adaptions to its new host include recent acquisition of higher-GC genes, expression of out-of-frame proteins within predicted genes, and codon selection among highly expressed genes toward the translational apparatus of its new host. IMPORTANCE The mycobacteriophage Patience genome has a notably lower GC content (50.3%) than its Mycobacterium smegmatis host (67.4%) and has markedly different codon usage biases. The viral genome has an abundance of codons that are rare in the host and are decoded by wobble tRNA pairing, although the phage grows well and expression of most of the genes is detected by mass spectrometry. Patience thus has the genomic profile of a virus that evolved primarily in one type of host genetic landscape (moderate-GC bacteria) but has found its way into a distinctly different high-GC environment. Although Patience genes are ill matched to the host expression apparatus, this is of little functional consequence and has not evidently imposed a barrier to migration across the microbial landscape. Interestingly, comparison of expression levels and codon usage profiles reveals evidence of codon selection as the genome evolves and adapts to its new environment.","phages (average, 57.3% GC). The genome diversity and percent GC range of the mycobacteriophages support a model for phage genome evolution in which phages migrate much more rapidly across a diverse bacterial landscape than their genomes ameliorate toward that of any one host (4) . Thus, mycobacteriophages at the lower end of the percent GC spectrum are predicted to have infected lower-GC hosts in their recent evolutionary pasts (4) . We note that there are other phage-host systems with mismatched GC contents, such as T4 and the right arm of phage lambda (35.3% and 44.4%, respectively), relative to their Escherichia coli host (50.8%)."
,"In this article, we propose a 3-dimensional graphical representation of protein sequences based on 10 physicochemical properties of 20 amino acids and the BLOSUM62 matrix. It contains evolutionary information and provides intuitive visualization. To further analyze the similarity of proteins, we extract a specific vector from the graphical representation curve. The vector is used to calculate the similarity distance between 2 protein sequences. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to 3 real data sets. The results are consistent with the known evolution fact and show that our method is effective in phylogenetic analysis.","With the number of available biological sequences developing rapidly, how to mine essential information from a huge amount of biological sequences effectively and reliably has become a critical problem. As a result, many methods in information extraction are proposed by researchers. Among them, the graphical representation of DNA sequences is an effective method for the virtualization and similarity analysis. Graphical representation is a kind of alignment-free method. It provides intuitive information of data by visualization of biological sequences. What is more, it is more generally applicable because its mathematical description of data facilitates numerical analysis without difficult calculations. Therefore, numerous works based on graphical representation have been presented by researchers. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] For example, Randić et al 1 proposed a graphical representation of RNA secondary structure based on twelve symbols. Bielińska-Waż et al 5 proposed a 2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences in 2007. After that they proposed more dynamic representations of DNA sequences for generalization. 6, 7 However, the graphical representation of protein sequences is much more difficult because there are 20 amino acids instead of 4 nucleotides. Various approaches have been proposed by researchers only until recently. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Among them, many approaches are based primarily on the physicochemical properties of amino acids. Randić 9 early proposed a 2-dimensional graphical representation of proteins based on a pair of physicochemical properties in 2007. After that, Yu et al 11 proposed a protein mapping method of protein sequences based on 10 physicochemical properties. Wang et al 10 presented a graphical representation of protein sequences based on 9 physicochemical properties. In the works by He et al 15 and Hu, 16 the physicochemical properties are also indispensable in information extraction from proteins because they have effects on the rate and pattern of protein evolution. From these, we can see that physicochemical properties are widely applied with graphical representation of protein sequences by these researchers and their results seem well."

Poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical comorbidities. We report a new case of MERS-CoV infection in a 9-month-old child complicated by severe respiratory symptoms, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.

"LoFreq: a sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller for uncovering cell-population heterogeneity from high-throughput sequencing datasets","The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, from viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by recent advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in <0.05% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer. Source code and executables for LoFreq are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lofreq/.","Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled more widespread study of heterogeneity and subpopulations in a cell population, and a migration away from a 'consensus sequence' view of their evolution. Such a 'population perspective' has applications in a range of biological systems, from the characterization of viral quasi species and intra-host variation (1, 2) , to bacterial sub-populations (3) (4) (5) , to sub-clonal evolution in cancer (6) (7) (8) . Precise characterization of population structure (and rare sub-populations) in these studies is fundamental to the analysis of population evolution and dynamics as a function of host response or drug exposure. Several recent cancer sequencing studies have further emphasized the functional role of rare sub-populations and variants in aspects such as tumor growth, drug resistance and metastasis (9, 10) and the need for computational tools to study them."
"Open Forum Infectious Diseases Bioaerosol Sampling in Clinical Settings: A Promising, Noninvasive Approach for Detecting Respiratory Viruses","Background. Seeking a noninvasive method to conduct surveillance for respiratory pathogens, we sought to examine the usefulness of 2 types of off-the-shelf aerosol samplers to detect respiratory viruses in Singapore.","Although much of human-to-human respiratory virus transmission occurs through direct contact (personal or fomite), there is increasing evidence that respiratory viruses may be transmitted in air via large or small respiratory droplets at distances greater than previous anticipated [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In recent studies, researchers at the University of Minnesota, Ohio State University, University of Georgia, and Wake Forest University have pioneered the use of novel bioaerosol sampling techniques in US agricultural and clinical settings [5] [6] [7] [8] . We too have found these techniques useful in detecting respiratory viruses in agricultural settings in China [9, 10] . In combination with molecular techniques, bioaerosol sampling can advance the detection efforts of novel airborne respiratory viruses soon after they are introduced into a new population. Our overall goal is to adapt bioaerosol sampling methods as a noninvasive measure for detecting novel emerging respiratory pathogen (human and animal-reservoired coronaviruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses). In this pilot study, we sought to evaluate the use of 2 off-the-shelf aerosol samplers in various clinical settings in Singapore, a major transportation hub in Southeast Asia."
FULL PAPER Virology Development of a one-run real-time PCR detection system for pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease complex,"Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is frequently found in cattle worldwide. The etiology of BRDC is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, making identification of the causal pathogen difficult. Here, we developed a detection system by applying TaqMan real-time PCR (Dembo respiratory-PCR) to screen a broad range of microbes associated with BRDC in a single run. We selected 16 bovine respiratory pathogens (bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, influenza D virus, bovine rhinitis A virus, bovine rhinitis B virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adenovirus 7, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Trueperella pyogenes, Mycoplasma bovis and Ureaplasma diversum) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for nine of them. The assay performance was assessed using standard curves from synthesized DNA. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was evaluated by spiking solutions extracted from nasal swabs that were negative by Dembo respiratory-PCR for nucleic acids of pathogens or synthesized DNA. All primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. In this study, a total of 40 nasal swab samples from cattle on six farms were tested by Dembo respiratory-PCR. Dembo respiratory-PCR can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets.","BRDC, include bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), and bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV 3) and 7 (BAdV 7) [12, 28] . In addition, a metagenomic approach to BRDC in cattle recently revealed that several other viruses may be involved in BRDC, such as influenza D virus (IDV), bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) [13, 23] . Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Trueperella pyogenes and Mycoplasma bovis are bacteria consistently associated with BRDC [1, 11] . Ureaplasma diversum has also been isolated from BRDC cattle [8] . Infection with each single pathogen does not necessarily result in appearance of symptoms, but complex infections with a variety of pathogens, including the indigenous agents, develop severe conditions. Such multiple pathogens infection make it difficult to identify the etiology of BRDC rapidly."
Kang SJ and Kim NS • Circulating Toll-like receptor 2-positive monocytes in Kawasaki disease Association of Toll-like receptor 2-positive mo- no cytes with coronary artery lesions and treat- ment nonresponse in Kawasaki disease,"Purpose: Activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) present on circulating monocytes in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) can lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukin-10 (IL-10). We aimed to determine the association of the frequency of circulating TLR2+/ CD14+ monocytes (FTLR2%) with the outcomes of KD, as well as to compare FTLR2% to the usefulness of sIL-10. Methods: The FTLR2% in patients with KD was measured by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-10 (sIL-10) were determined in 31 patients with KD before the initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and in 21 febrile controls by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were classified as having coronary artery lesions (CALs) based on the maximal internal diameters of the proximal right coronary artery and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery one month after the initial diagnosis. Results: We found that FTLR2% greater than 92.62% predicted CALs with 80% sensitivity and 68.4% specificity, whereas FTLR2% more than 94.61% predicted IVIG resistance with 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Moreover, sIL-10 more than 15.52 pg/mL predicted CALs and IVIG resistance with 40% and 66.7% sensitivity, respectively, and 73.7% and 76.2% specificity, respectively. Conclusion: We showed that measuring FTLR2% before the initial treatment could be useful in predicting CAL development with better sensitivity than sIL-10 and with results comparable to sIL-10 results for the prediction of IVIG resistance in patients with KD. However, further studies are necessary to validate FTLR2% as a marker of prognosis and severity of KD.","Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis occurring in infants and children. Ap proximately 3%-5% of the afflicted children develop coronary artery lesions (CALs) despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1, 2) .

Antiviral therapeutic approaches for human rhinovirus infections,"Human rhinoviruses are the primary etiological agent of the common cold. This infection can be mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts, but can be associated with bronchiolitis in infants, pneumonia in the immunosuppressed and exacerbations of pre-existing pulmonary conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many of these conditions can place significant economic costs upon healthcare infrastructure. There is currently no licensed vaccine for rhinovirus, as the large variety of rhinovirus serotypes has posed significant challenges for research. In this review, we discuss current knowledge around antiviral drugs and small molecule inhibitors of rhinovirus infection, as well as antiviral host defense peptides as exciting prospects to approach the development of novel therapeutics which target human rhinovirus.","addition, the significant morbidities and associated economic costs attributed to RV infections would lend weight to a global effort into the full characterization of different RV strains. Thus, the development of effective antivirals against the widest possible number of RV serotypes is urgently required."
The Journal of Infectious Diseases The Domestic Ferret (Mustela putorius furo) as a Lethal Infection Model for 3 Species of Ebolavirus,"Small-animal models have been developed for several Filoviridae species; however, serial adaptation was required to produce lethal infection. These adapted viruses have sequence changes in several genes, including those that modulate the host immune response. Nonhuman primate models do not require adaptation of filoviruses. Here, we describe lethal models of disease for Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Zaire species of Ebolavirus in the domestic ferret, using wild-type nonadapted viruses. Pathologic features were consistent with disease in primates. Of particular importance, this is the only known small-animal model developed for Bundibugyo and the only uniformly lethal animal model for Bundibugyo.","Until recently, 3 members of the genus Ebolavirus-Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV)-have been responsible for small, sporadic outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in humans throughout Central Africa. From December 2013 through January 2016, the devastating emergence of ZEBOV in Western Africa resulted in overwhelming societal tolls in the region. The already weakened public health infrastructure of the region, coupled with a dearth of available, approved diagnostic assays, vaccines, or therapeutic agents, likely contributed to the severity of this epidemic. During the course of the epidemic, a number of medical countermeasures were introduced, but screening and validation of these interventions in animal models were limited by the use of host-adapted small-animal models or the availability of nonhuman primate (NHP) resources [1] ."

Pathogen screening and prognostic factors in children with severe ARDS of pulmonary origin,"Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most lethal diseases encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The etiological pathogens and prognostic factors of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infections were prospectively investigated. Methods: Enrolled children fulfilled the following criteria: (1) PICU admission; (2) age of 1 month to 16 years; (3) diagnosis of infectious pneumonia and respiratory virus infection; and (4) development of severe ARDS within 72 h after PICU admission. Pathogens were detected in the blood and tracheal lavage fluid using molecular techniques and a conventional culture system. The serum levels of inflammatory mediators on the day of PICU admission were examined. Results: Fifty-seven patients (32 boys; median age, 9 months) were enrolled. Multiple virus infections, co-infection with bacteria/fungus, and bacteremia/fungemia were observed in 60%, 49%, and 32% of children, respectively. Adenovirus-B, measles virus, and cytomegalovirus were detected predominantly in tracheal lavage fluid. There were no statistically significant differences between non-survivors and survivors regarding the types of pathogen, incidence of multiple virus infection, gender, age, clinical features, and treatment. The serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ and the IFN-γ/interleukin (IL)-10 ratio were higher in non-survivors. Conclusions: IFN-γ upregulation as detected on the day of PICU admission was found to be one of the possible prognostic factors affecting a fatal outcome. These results suggest that modulation of inflammatory responses is critical for the clinical management of children with ARDS.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous syndrome with a severe lung inflammation disorder that presents as rapidly progressive hypoxemia and dyspnea. 1 ARDS is principally associated with direct injury to the lung, such as infectious pneumonia, or indirect injury to the lung resulting from systemic inflammation, such as non-pulmonary sepsis, trauma, and surgery. 2 Pneumonia remains the predominant cause of death in children under 5 years of age 3 and it is the most common trigger of ARDS in children. 4 Pediatric ARDS is one of the most lethal diseases in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and is associated with a high rate of mortality. 5 Historically, pediatric ARDS was defined using the adult ARDS criteria based on the American-European Consensus Conference 6 and Berlin Definition in 2012 7 before the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference published a pediatric-specific definition of ARDS in 2015. 8 According to the Berlin Definition, severe ARDS is defined as hypoxemia with ≤100 mm Hg of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 mm Hg) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) ratio (P/F ratio) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"
Characterization of canine coronavirus spread among domestic dogs in Vietnam,"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an important pathogen that causes enteritis in dogs, but there is no information on CCoV infection in Vietnam. To examine the prevalence of CCoV infection among Vietnamese dogs, 201 serum samples were analyzed by virus-neutralization (VN) test. The results showed that antibody against CCoV-II was present in 87 dogs (43.3%). To detect genes of CCoV, fecal samples collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs were examinated by RT-PCR, confirming that 2 diarrheic dogs and 5 healthy dogs were positive for CCoV. Nucleotide sequences of N-terminal region of spike (S) gene indicated that CCoV strains were divided into two subgenotypes, CCoV-IIa and -IIb, respectively. Furthemore, we succeeded in isolating CCoV/ dog/HCM47/2015, the isolate was plaque-purified three times, and 3'-terminal one-third of the genome was analyzed. Interestingly, the plaque-purified virus had a large deletion in ORF3abc and E genes (1,165 nt), and a short deletion in ORF7b gene (60 nt), suggesting that these regions are not necessary for in vitro replication of CCoV. Next, the antigenicity between the isolated CCoV-IIb and the other CCoV-IIa was compared by VN test, revealing that antigenicty of the isolated CCoV is equal or higher than that of the other CCoV. In summary, two subgenotypes of CCoV-II are spreading among Vietnamese dogs. The isolated virus with a large deletion after in vitro passage may be useful for the development of vaccine, owing to its antigenicity and efficient viral growth in vitro.","A total of 80 fecal swabs were collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs in animal hospitals and households, respectively, in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam from 2013 to 2015. Their ages ranged from 2 months to 13 years. Swab samples were dissolved in 2 ml of phosphate-buffer saline (PBS), filtrated through a 0.22-µm filter (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland) and stored at −80°C until analysis. "
Protective Effect and Mechanism of Alprostadil in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by Oleic Acid in Rats,This study investigated the role and mechanism of alprostadil in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) in rats.,"Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also known as acute lung injury (ALI), is one of the most challenging clinical conditions in critical care medicine. It is a severe, life-threatening medical condition characterized by acute and widespread inflammation in the lungs [1] , which leads to protein-rich nonhydrostatic pulmonary edema and refractory hypoxemia [2] . It increases lung ""stiffness"" and impairs the ability of the lung to remove carbon dioxide [3] . Many pathogenic conditions can trigger ARDS, such as sepsis and pneumonia [4] . Although the outcome of ARDS has improved with advances in ventilator strategies, mortality is still high. The LUNG SAFE study reports a 40% hospital mortality rate, with a significant increase across the ARDS severity categories, in line with the Berlin definition (34.9% in mild ARDS, 40.3% in moderate ARDS, and 46.1% in severe ARDS) [5] . No specific and effective pharmacological intervention for ARDS is currently available [3] ; therefore, it is critical to develop new clinical drugs for the treatment of ARDS."

Detection of respiratory viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction in outpatients with acute respiratory infection,"Viruses are the major contributors to the morbidity and mortality of upper and lower acute respiratory infections (ARIs) for all age groups. The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies for a large range of respiratory viruses using a sensitive molecular detection technique in specimens from outpatients of all ages with ARIs. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 162 individuals between August 2007-August 2009. Twenty-three pathogenic respiratory agents, 18 respiratory viruses and five bacteria were investigated using multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF). Through IIF, 33 (20.4%) specimens with respiratory virus were recognised, with influenza virus representing over half of the positive samples. Through a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, 88 (54.3%) positive samples were detected; the most prevalent respiratory viral pathogens were influenza, human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Six cases of viral co-detection were observed, mainly involving RSV. The use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR increased the viral detection by 33.9% and revealed a larger number of respiratory viruses implicated in ARI cases, including the most recently described respiratory viruses [human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HCoV HKU1].","Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children during the first years of life (Osterhaus 2008) ."
Virus ecology: a gap between detection and prediction,The past few months have yielded disconcerting news about viruses carried in mammalian reservoirs. What is the relevance of virus discoveries mushrooming in the literature? Will bats yield the next pandemic virus? Animal ecologists and virologists need to join forces.,"Virologists have been surprised by a recent report that has changed our long-standing conception of the ecology of influenza viruses. Potentially, we can no longer rely on waterfowl to be the only source of new flu variants, as bats have now been found to harbor influenza viruses whose internal genes share common ancestry with all known influenza A viruses. 1 Other genome portions share even older ancestry, 2 while the main surface protein lies within the known diversity of 'usual' influenza A viruses. The appearance of such a vast mixture of genes suggests that more undiscovered flu strains are lurking in bats."
Susceptibility to Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte-induced Apoptosis Is a Function of the Proliferative Status of the Target,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) kill ceils by perturbing the target's plasma membrane and by inducing the disintegration of the target cell's DNA into oligonudeosomal fragments, a process characteristic of apoptosis. We show that the DNA fragmentation event is distinct from the membrane lysis event and is dependent on the state of target cell activation or commitment into the mitotic cycle. Quiescent cells were refractory to DNA fragmentation, but not to membrane lysis. Log phase growth, transformation with c-myc, or infection of quiescent Go targets with herpes simplex virus-l, which induces a competent state for DNA synthesis, all enhanced target cell susceptibility to CTL-induced DNA fragmentation without altering the membrane lysis. These results suggest that Go cells are resistant to CTL-induced apoptosis, but that entry into G1 or a Gl-like state by growth factors, cellular transformation, or DNA virus infection renders them competent to enter the apoptotic pathway(s). W. K. Nishioka would like to thank Drs. J. Campisi, D. Green, E. Martz, and S. Silverstein for insightful discussions; A. Mahboubi for critical reading of the manuscript; M. Cole for the c-myc containing retrovirus; J. Stein for the BALB/c 3T3, done A31 cells; and D. G. Nishioka for support and motivation.","C TLs, which are principal mediators in the elimination of transformed and virus-infected cells from the host, kill their targets by the direct disruption of the plasma membrane and by the induction of the suicide program known as apoptosis (1) (2) (3) (4) . The CTEs arsenal includes the pore-forming protein perforin, a family ofproteases called granzymes, and tumor necrosis factorlike molecules packaged together in cytoplasmic granules (3, 4) . The granule exocytosis model of CTL killing proposes that, upon recognition of viral-or tumor-associated antigen(s) presented via the MHC class I mdecule, the CTL is triggered to release its cytotoxic granule components onto the target cell's plasma membrane. Perforin inserts into the target's plasma membrane and forms transmembrane channds to cause the osmotic lysis of the target (3) . The remaining cytotoxic granule components interact with as yet undefined target cell dements to trigger the apoptotic death of the target, characterized by cellular disintegration and fragmentation of the target's DNA into nudeosome particles (2) (3) (4) ."
A novel immunity system for bacterial nucleic acid degrading toxins and its recruitment in various eukaryotic and DNA viral systems,"The use of nucleases as toxins for defense, offense or addiction of selfish elements is widely encountered across all life forms. Using sensitive sequence profile analysis methods, we characterize a novel superfamily (the SUKH superfamily) that unites a diverse group of proteins including Smi1/Knr4, PGs2, FBXO3, SKIP16, Syd, herpesviral US22, IRS1 and TRS1, and their bacterial homologs. Using contextual analysis we present evidence that the bacterial members of this superfamily are potential immunity proteins for a variety of toxin systems that also include the recently characterized contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems of proteobacteria. By analyzing the toxin proteins encoded in the neighborhood of the SUKH superfamily we predict that they possess domains belonging to diverse nuclease and nucleic acid deaminase families. These include at least eight distinct types of DNases belonging to HNH/ EndoVII-and restriction endonuclease-fold, and RNases of the EndoU-like and colicin E3-like cytotoxic RNases-folds. The N-terminal domains of these toxins indicate that they are extruded by several distinct secretory mechanisms such as the two-partner system (shared with the CDI systems) in proteobacteria, ESAT-6/WXG-like ATP-dependent secretory systems in Gram-positive bacteria and the conventional Sec-dependent system in several bacterial lineages. The hedgehog-intein domain might also release a subset of toxic nuclease domains through auto-proteolytic action. Unlike classical colicin-like nuclease toxins, the overwhelming majority of toxin systems with the SUKH superfamily is chromosomally encoded and appears to have diversified through a recombination process combining different C-terminal nuclease domains to N-terminal secretion-related domains. Across the bacterial superkingdom these systems might participate in discriminating 'self' or kin from 'non-self' or non-kin strains. Using structural analysis we demonstrate that the SUKH domain possesses a versatile scaffold that can be used to bind a wide range of protein partners. In eukaryotes it appears to have been recruited as an adaptor to regulate modification of proteins by ubiquitination or polyglutamylation. Similarly, another widespread immunity protein from these toxin systems, namely the suppressor of fused (SuFu) superfamily has been recruited for comparable roles in eukaryotes. In animal DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, iridoviruses and adenoviruses, the ability of the SUKH domain to bind diverse targets has been deployed to counter diverse anti-viral responses by interacting with specific host proteins.","The use of toxins as a defensive, offensive or selfish addictive strategy is observed across the tree of life. Interestingly, a diverse set of protein toxins from distantly related organisms have a propensity to catalyze nucleic acid modifying or cleaving reactions in their target cells. Well-known examples are currently known from across the phylogenetic spectrum: plants deploy toxins such as ricin, abrin and modeccin to protect their seeds, which are RNA N-glycosidases that remove a specific purine *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +1 301 594 2445; Fax: +1 301 480 9241; Email: aravind@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov base from eukaryotic 28S rRNA to render it non-functional (1, 2) . In a similar vein, the fungal toxin a-sarcin, produced by fungi such as Aspergillus giganteus, acts as a specific endonuclease that cleaves the 28S rRNA at a position close to the site of action of the above plant toxins (3) . Among animals the use of nucleic acid-targeting enzymes is observed in the venoms of snakes (4) . Several animals, including vertebrates, are known to deploy cytotoxic RNases, such as RNase A, which potentially target RNA from bacteria and viruses (5) . Bacteria are a particularly rich source of nucleic acid-targeting toxins, which are deployed in various contexts. Pathogenic bacteria secrete RNA N-glycosidases that target the 28S rRNA of eukaryotic hosts similar to the ricin-like plant toxins (6) . Bacteria are also known to deploy RNase and DNase bacteriocins in intra-and possibly inter-specific competition that target molecules such as tRNA and genomic DNA (7) . The best known are the plasmid-borne toxins of the model bacterium Escherichia coli, which kill closely related competing strains. Of these colicins E3, E4 and E6 cleave rRNA, colicins E5 and D cleave tRNA and colicins E2, E7, E8 and E9 cleave DNA (8) . Additionally, bacterial genomes are also colonized by systems such as the toxin-antitoxin systems and restriction-modification systems which produce enzymes that function as nucleic acid-targeting toxins (9) (10) (11) (12) . In these systems the primary function of the toxin is to kill the host bacterial cell if the toxin encoding system is genetically disrupted in some way (10, 11) . Thus, they act as selfish elements that forcibly 'addict' the host to maintain them in genomes or plasmids. In many of these cases, organisms or genetic elements that produce the toxin also produce an antitoxin or immunity protein that renders the 'self' resistant to the action of the toxin. The study of these toxins and antitoxins or immunity proteins has not only expanded our understanding of the evolution of inter-species competition but also thrown considerable light on the biochemistry of nucleic acids and other molecules that interact with them (9) (10) (11) (12) . In practical terms these nucleic acid-targeting toxins and antitoxins/immunity proteins are potential reagents that could be utilized in numerous biotechnological contexts ranging from chemical analysis of nucleic acids to bio-defense."

"Optimized Expression, Purification of Herpes B Virus gD Protein in Escherichia coli, and Production of Its Monoclonal Antibodies","Background: Herpes B virus (BV) is a zoonotic disease caused by double-stranded enveloped DNA virus with cercopithecidae as its natural host. The mortality rate of infected people could be up to 70% with fatal encephalitis and encephalomyelitis. Up to now, there are no effective treatments for BV infection. Among the various proteins encoded by monkey B virus, gD, a conserved structural protein, harbors important application value for serological diagnosis of frequent variations of the monkey B virus.","Herpesviridae is a family of viruses with doublestranded DNA. The B virus (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1, or herpes B virus) and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 2 (CeHV-2) are primate herpes viruses that belong to the alphaherpesvirus subfamily, and are closely related to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The coated particle harbors a linear double-stranded DNA genome of about 157 kb (1) (2) (3) (4) . Herpes B virus (BV) is a zoonotic virus and its natural host is mainly cercopithecidae, although BV infections are usually mild or unapparent in macaques, yet lead to fatal encephalitis and encephalomyelitis in humans (2, 5, 6) . Previous studies (7) have shown that BV is the only known agent that could infect humans among the 35 herpesviruses confirmed in nonhuman primates. In the early stages of infection, if not treated by antiviral therapy, the infection would have a high mortality."
H O W D O I ? How do we … integrate pathogen reduced platelets into our hospital blood bank inventory?,ABBREVIATIONS: ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; BLA = biologics license application; EMR = electronic medical record; IT = information technology; PR = pathogen reduction; SDP(s) = single-donor platelet(s); TA-GVHD = transfusionassociated graft-versus-host disease.,"For more than 50 years there has been an ongoing effort to combat transfusion-transmitted infections and provide patients with the safest possible blood. This initiative has driven much of the research within the transfusion community. Initial methods included screening donors for travel histories to banned areas and for high-risk behaviors, but pathogen-specific assays performed at the collection and manufacturing sites also have become key factors in assuring blood safety. Many of these have focused on donor and laboratory-based screening for transfusion-transmitted diseases, as evidenced by the hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus screening in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. More recently, this effort has expanded to develop donor screening assays to identify other blood-borne pathogens, such as Zika and West Nile viruses and Babesia. Bacterial contamination of units of platelets (PLTs), however, remains a significant concern. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved rapid tests to identify bacterially contaminated PLT units in the blood bank before transfusion. Other supplemental methods have been developed, however, that aim to inactivate bloodborne pathogen(s) present in the blood product, rather than to rely on our ability to identify and interdict contaminated and infected components. Pathogen reduction technology, as this is referred to, provides a proactive way to further reduce the risk posed by transfusion-transmitted infections."
Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses,"RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that catalyzes the synthesis of their RNA(s). In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the RdRp resides in a replicase subunit that is unusually large. Bioinformatics analysis of this non-structural protein has now revealed a nidoviral signature domain (genetic marker) that is N-terminally adjacent to the RdRp and has no apparent homologs elsewhere. Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity. We used recombinant nonstructural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue. Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRpassociated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding. Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses. Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.","Positive-stranded (+) RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales can infect either vertebrate (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) or invertebrate hosts (Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae) (1, 2) . Examples of nidoviruses with high economic and societal impact are the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (3) and the zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans (4) (5) (6) . While nidoviruses constitute a monophyletic group, their genome size differences are striking, with genomes ranging from 13-16 kb for arteriviruses to 20-21 kb for mesoniviruses and 25-34 kb for roniviruses and coronaviruses, which may reflect different stages of the largest genome expansion known to have occurred in RNA viruses (7) ."
The Journal of Infectious Diseases Autophagy-Associated Proteins Control Ebola Virus Internalization Into Host Cells,"Ebola virus (EBOV) enters host cells by macropinocytosis, a poorly understood process. Recent studies have suggested that cell factors involved in autophagy, an evolutionally conserved pathway leading to the lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates and organelles during cellular stress, also have roles in macropinocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy-associated proteins are required for trafficking of EBOV into the cell body. Depleting cells of beclin 1, autophagy-related protein 7, or microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3B (LC3B) abolished EBOV uptake, owing to a block in vesicle formation at the cell surface. Both LC3B-I and LC3B-II interacted with macropinocytic structures. Our work indicates that, although various forms of LC3B possess an inherent ability to associate with forming macropinosomes, LC3B-II is critical for internalization of macropinocytic vesicles and, therefore, EBOV from the cell surface.","Ebola virus (EBOV) is an emerging pathogen causing severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. Despite significant progress, there are no licensed therapeutics to treat or prevent associated disease [1] . EBOV is a filamentous enveloped virus belonging to the family Filoviridae. The virion surface is studded with homotrimeric glycoprotein complexes, which are the sole viral determinant of binding to host cell receptors [2] . The majority of EBOV particles enter cells through macropinocytosis and subsequently traffic through endocytic compartments before release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm, where genome replication takes place [3, 4] ."
Stockpile Model of Personal Protective Equipment in Taiwan,The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) has established a 3-tier personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiling framework that could maintain a minimum stockpile for the surge demand of PPE in the early stage of a pandemic.,"T he severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 had a severe impact on Taiwan's health security systems. At the time, medical masks (including surgical masks and N95 respirators) and coveralls were in short supply, resulting in fear, decreased confi-dence, and decreased willingness to work among frontline healthcare workers. 1, 2 In addition, the insufficient supply of medical masks in the retail markets triggered panic buying by the public. Consequently, the Communicable Disease Control Act in Taiwan was amended, and a 3-tier stockpiling framework of personal protective equipment (PPE) was established in 2003. Based on the act, the central government, local health authorities, and medical institutions are required to maintain a minimum stockpile of PPE (including surgical masks, N95 respirators, and coveralls) to ensure a sufficient supply for epidemic prevention and frontline healthcare personnel during the early phase of an epidemic. However, during nonepidemic periods, the use of PPE from the central government inventory was relatively limited; thus, most of the PPE remained unused and expired and needed to be destroyed. To solve this issue, the Taiwan CDC, which is responsible for the management of the national stockpile system, developed a concept of stockpile replacement incorporated with a public-private partnership, including public sectors and private contractors, and employing the principles of logistics, supply chain management, commercial marketing, and relevant laws and regulations. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In this article, the national stockpile systems in the US, Canada, Australia, and Singapore are briefly introduced, and the stockpile model with a replacement mechanism in Taiwan is described and evaluated. The experience described may serve as a reference for improving the national stockpile system of other countries."
,"Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (g), we estimated R 0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R 0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R 0 . Conclusion: The mean estimate of R 0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.","The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020a). As of January 26 (17:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 2033 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 56 deaths (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). The 2019-nCoV cases were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all of these cases were exported from Wuhan; see the World Health Organization (WHO) news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14-21. The outbreak is still ongoing. A recently published preprint by Imai et al. estimated that a total of 1723 (95% CI: 427-4471) cases of 2019-nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 (Imai et al., 2020) . The likelihood of travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by Bogoch et al. (2020) , which indicates the potentials of regional and global spread (Leung et al., 2020) ."
Analysis of the association between necrotizing enterocolitis and transfusion of red blood cell in very low birth weight preterm infants,"Purpose: To investigate the association between necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and red blood cell transfusions in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. Methods: We studied were 180 VLBW preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of CHA Gangnam Hospital from January of 2006 to December of 2009. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: an NEC group (greater than stage II on the modified Bell's criteria) and a control group (less than stage II on the modified Bell's critieria). We defined red blood cell transfusion before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in the NEC group and the frequency of transfusion until 18 days after birth in the control group. Results: Of the 180 subjects, 18 (10%) belonged to the NEC group, and 14 (78%) of these 18 patients had a history of transfusion before NEC diagnosis. The NEC group received 3.1±2.9 transfusions, and the control group received 1.0±1.1 transfusions before the NEC diagnosis (P=0.005). In a multi variate logistic regression corrected for gestational age, Apgar score at 1 minute, the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, premature rupture of membrane, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and death were confounding factors. The risk of NEC increased 1.63 times (95% confidence interval, 1.145 to 2.305; P=0.007) with transfusion before the NEC diagnosis. Conclusion: The risk for NEC increased significantly with increased transfusion frequency before the NEC diagnosis.","Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an emergency gastrointestinal disease in neonates due to mucosal or transmural necrosis of the bowel. About 7% to 13% of all very low birth weight (VLBW) infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) develop NEC, with a mortality range of 10% to 44% [1] [2] [3] , and both the incidence and mor tality rate increase with decreasing birth weight and gestational age (GA). Intestine immaturity, birth asphyxia, low appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (Apgar) score, intestinal ischemic change due to umbilical artery catheterization, viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus, and en tero virus), infection from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or Clostridium difficile, and early rapid feeding are cause of NEC [4] [5] [6] . Some reports have indicated an association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (RBC(t)) and NEC, but this is controversial [7] [8] [9] [10] . In this study, we analyzed the association between NEC and RBC(t) in VLBW preterm infants."

First Report of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Human Metapneumovirus Co-Infection in a 2-Year-Old Kawasaki Patient in Iran,"Respiratory virus infections in children are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Methods: A total of 897 clinical specimens were collected from February 2007 to January 2008 and transported to the National Influenza Center. Two hundred and two samples belonged to children under the age of six from 897 specimens, described above, were selected. Then they were tested for influenza virus types and subtypes by real time PCR assay subsequently, the specimens were tested for RSV and hMPV by hemi-nested multiplex PCR and parainfluenza viruses type 1-4 by hemi-nested multiplex PCR and adenovirus by hemi-nested PCR. Results: The throat swab was taken from the Kawasaki case with the history of chicken`s contact. The specimen was tested for all influenza subtypes especially H5N1 and the results were negative. Meanwhile PCR was done for screening of other respiratory viruses that results came out positive for RSV and hMPV. Conclusion: In the present study, we demonstrated the possibility to detect dual infection caused by RSV and hMPV, but because of the extravagant pattern of this case, more investigation is suggested specially on Kawasaki patients.","Due to worldwide occurrence, substantial morbidity and mortality rates, respiratory viral infection which swiftly and easily spread, pose a serious public health problem (1) . Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is one of the etiological agents of acute respiratory tract infections (AR-TIs) which can infect people in all age groups (2) . It induces clinical symptoms ranging from upper to lower respiratory tract illnesses such as bronchiolitis, bronchitis and pneumonia (3) (4) (5) . In 2001, HMPV was identified in samples from children with respiratory tract disease for the first time (6) . In addition, it is a new member of the family paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirus, genus metapneumovirus (7) . RSV is one of the most important respiratory pathogens of childhood, with detection rates reaching 70-85% in hospitalized infants during seasonal winter epidemics worldwide (1, 8) . RSV causes severe lower respiratory infections like bronchiolitis or pneumonia in infants and young children (9) . Coinfection of hMPV with RSV in infants has been suggested to be a factor that influences the severity of bronchiolitis (9) . Phylogenetically, RSV is the closest human virus related to hMPV, and the clinical manifestations of hMPV may share an overlapping spectrum with RSV, so that these two viruses cannot be distinguished by clinical manifestations (4, 7, 9, 10) . RSV and hMPV might have similar seasonal patterns, so co-infection is possible (6, 9) . This report describes a case who did not have the respiratory sign and symptoms, while was actually infected with RSV and hMPV simultaneously. and mouth since 4 d ago. In spite of treating with antipyretics, fever still was persistent. On physical examination, the vital signs were as follow: respiration, 22 breath/min; pulse, 104 beats/min and temperature, 38˚ C. Cardiac, abdominal, neurological and respiratory findings were normal. Laboratory findings were as follows: WBC count, 9.9×10 3 /µl; RBC, 3.77×10 6 /µl; Hb, 10.6 g/dl; Hct, 34.5%; PLT, 443×10 3 /µl; ESR, 90; CRP, +1; Wright/Widal and salmonella Para A/B, Typhi D were negative. Stool exam was normal. In the abdominal sonography, there was no problem and chest X ray was also normal. According to the findings, possible diagnosis was Kawasaki syndrome and treatment with IVIG, aspirin and acetaminophen was started. After one day, fever was resolved but dry cough started at the day four of the admission. Because of the history of contact with chickens and possibility of H5N1, throat swab specimen of the patient was collected and sent to the National Influenza Center in Tehran university of Medical Sciences for influenza surveillance. The specimen was tested for Influenza virus types and subtypes by real time PCR assay using CDC procedure, CDC Real-Time RT-PCR (r.RT-PCR) protocol for detection and characterization of influenza virus (version.2007), but the result was negative. Subsequently, as a part of a project, the specimen was tested for RSV and hMPV by heminested multiplex PCR and parainfluenza viruses type 1-4 by hemi-nested multiplex PCR (11) , and adenovirus by hemi-nested PCR (12) . In our surprise positive results for RSV and hMPV were observed without any special respiratory sign and symptoms. The test was repeated and the results were confirmed again. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product of the detected hMPV (the M gene fragment) was submitted to GenBank (Accession no. GQ219792)."
Cell Host Response to Infection with Novel Human Coronavirus EMC Predicts Potential Antivirals and Important Differences with SARS Coronavirus,"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) was recently identified in the Middle East as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembling the illness caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor. Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection.","partially explaining the large host range of HCoV-EMC. This was somewhat surprising, as coronaviruses generally show strict host specificity."

Due to the range of pathogens responsible for CAP, in moderate or severe infection, broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover should be initiated before de-escalating to narrowspectrum pathogen-directed agents once a microbiological diagnosis has been made [1, 5] . Unfortunately, de-escalation is uncommon in practice because current diagnostic methods may identify a pathogen in only 30%-40% of patients with CAP [4, 6, 7] . Recent studies have highlighted the need for more timely and sensitive microbiological diagnostic methods in CAP, particularly for bacteria and in the common scenario of antibiotic administration prior to sampling [4, 8, 9] ."
Phenol-Rich Compounds Sweet Gel: A Statistically More Effective Antibiotic than Cloxacillin Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,The purpose of this study was to obtain a natural antibiotic from Phenol-rich compounds; for the dressing and the treatment of chronic wounds.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an aerobic gram-negative bacterium; that is ubiquitous, exist in aqueous habitats, and take advantage of humid en-vironments. It is also saprophytic and naturally resistant to antibiotics (beta-lactams, hydrophilic), and may become an opportunistic pathogen responsible for serious infections when favorable circumstances exist. Because it is environmentally present in soils, plants (including fruits and vegetables), aqueous habitats and humid environments [1], It has an ability to acquire resistance to antibiotics, and has multiplicity of virulence factors (diffusible or constituent) that baffle the host's defenses and allow the development of infections in susceptible patients, such as malnourished patients; burn victims, trauma patients, patients suffering from diabetes, cystic fibrosis, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and blood disorders, patients undergoing mechanical ventilation or long-term corticosteroid therapy; patients in whom carrier surveyed peripheral and central catheters are being used [2] . P. aeruginosa infections are most often acquired in a hospital, but are sometimes community acquired; Factors limiting P. aeruginosa proliferation on the skin are dryness of the skin's surface and normal flora (Gram + Cocci). The bacterium P. aeruginosa can grow or become permanent on the skin in case of the traumatic rupture of the skin barrier; chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, extensive burns, diabetes include ulcers, oozing dermatitis, and wet or macerated lesions the disappearance of Gram + Cocci normal flora caused by the use of systemic or topical antimicrobials. The first signs of infection of a chronic wound or ulcer are the production of greenish pus and the appearance of a characteristic aromatic odor. The appearance of the ulcer or wound becomes inflammatory or necrotic. These are vesicular or bullous lesions with a content of serum are hemorrhagic based on an erythematous and edematous base and can initially have the clinical appearance of multiform erythema. These lesions can change very quickly in a few days to ulceration, and they then take the appearance of a so-called ecthyma gangrenosum [3] [4] [5] [6] . One can also have abscesses or single or multiple subcutaneous nodules that can change very quickly to necrosis and ulceration."
Preclinical safety and tolerability of a repeatedly administered human leishmaniasis DNA vaccine,"The leishmaniases are a complex of vector-borne diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. LEISHDNAVAX is a multi-antigen, T-cell epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate against human leishmaniasis. The vaccine candidate has been proven immunogenic and showed prophylactic efficacy in preclinical studies. Here, we describe the safety testing of LEISHDNAVAX in naive mice and rats, complemented by the demonstration of tolerability in Leishmania-infected mice. Biodistribution and persistence were examined following single and repeated intradermal (i.d.) administration to rats. DNA vectors were distributed systemically but did not accumulate upon repeated injections. Although vector DNA was cleared from most other tissues within 60 days after the last injection, it persisted in skin at the site of injection and in draining lymph nodes. Evaluation of single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity of the vaccine candidate after i.d. administration to naive, non-infected mice did not reveal any safety concerns. LEISHDNAVAX was also well tolerated in Leishmania-infected mice. Taken together, our results substantiate a favorable safety profile of LEISHDNAVAX in both naive and infected animals and thus, support the initiation of clinical trials for both preventive and therapeutic applications of the vaccine.","The leishmaniases are a complex of diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania with up to 1.6 million cases reported worldwide annually 1 and~350 million people at risk to develop leishmaniasis. 2 It is estimated that the most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), causes up to 40 000 deaths per year. 1 Measures to control transmission of the parasite were of limited success to date. Despite advances in treatment of VL over the last decade, drug toxicity and heat stability, difficult routes of administration and variation in drug efficacy between endemic areas remain issues to be fully solved. A preventive and therapeutic leishmaniasis vaccine prospectively represents the most cost-effective and successful measure to control the leishmaniases worldwide. 3 Immunity to the intracellular parasite Leishmania is associated with T-cell-mediated immune responses. 4 DNA vaccines are particularly able to deliver antigens into the major histocompatibility complex class I processing pathway, thereby inducing CD8 cytotoxic T-cell immune responses, 5, 6 necessary for clearance of Leishmania. In addition, CD4 T cells and B cells are activated by DNA vaccines. Hence, this vaccination technology is a promising approach for developing a leishmaniasis vaccine. 7 An appropriate preclinical safety profile of a vaccine candidate has to be established prior to initiation of clinical phase 1 studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization recommend the evaluation of distribution and persistence of DNA vaccines as well as their local reactogenicity and systemic toxicity. 8, 9 Results of corresponding studies suggest that DNA vaccines are safe, 10, 11 which has been confirmed in several clinical trials. 12 However, immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was often modest in humans, necessitating better delivery methods and improved vaccine antigen expression. 12 In addition, safety concerns prompted avoidance of antibiotic resistance genes and other selection markers for plasmid propagation. 13 State-of-the-art plasmids are consequently more efficacious, safer and smaller than classical plasmids. 14 Minimalistic Immunogenically Defined Gene Expression (MIDGE) vectors represent one of the most rigorous concepts for improvement. 15 MIDGE vectors are small linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules, solely containing sequences required for their function in vivo and no bacterial plasmid backbone sequences as they have been shown to negatively impact transgene expression and immunogenicity. 16, 17 MIDGE-Th1 vectors are MIDGE vectors with a short peptide (PKKKRKVEDPYC) covalently attached, enhancing the immune responses to encoded antigens. 18, 19 Recently, preclinical data on biodistribution and toxicity of MIDGE and MIDGE-Th1 vectors have been published, 20, 21 indicating an excellent safety profile after a single administration."
,"In December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China. We report the epidemiological and clinical features of the first patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia imported into Korea from Wuhan. This report suggests that in the early phase of 2019-nCoV pneumonia, chest radiography would miss patients with pneumonia and highlights taking travel history is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of 2019-nCoV cases.","A 35-year-old woman, who lives in Wuhan, China, arrived at the Incheon Airport on January 19, 2020. During the quarantine inspection process at the airport, her body temperature was 38.3°C by a thermal scanner; therefore, she was immediately hospitalized in a designated isolation hospital. Pan coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was positive for the throat swab sample, and sequencing of the PCR amplicon showed that the sequence was identical to that of the 2019-nCoV isolated from the Wuhan patient. The patient was office accountancy and denied any exposure to a febrile patient, wild animals, or visiting wet markets, including the Sea Food Market in Wuhan."
Fulminant hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to a reactivated EBV infection: A case report,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive inflammatory syndrome that results from inappropriate activation of the immune system. HLH has a high mortality if not treated. We describe a case of a fulminant HLH, associated with a reactivation of an EBV infection. The patient responded well to steroid treatment.","Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive inflammatory syndrome with high mortality that results from inappropriate activation of the immune system (lymphocytes and macrophages). HLH appears to affect all ages, although the hereditary and sporadic cases are reported more often in children (1) . The incidence of HLH in Sweden has been estimated to 1.2 children per 1 million children per year, or 1 in 50,000 live births with equal sex distribution (2) ."
Changes in Chemokines and Chemokine Receptors Expression in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"The amyloid precursor protein plus presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mice are a frequently-used model for Alzheimer's disease studies (AD). However, the data relevant to which proteins are involved in inflammatory mechanism are not sufficiently well-studied using the AD mouse model. Using behavioral studies, quantitative RT-PCR and Western-blot techniques, significant findings were determined by the expression of proteins involved in inflammation comparing APP/PS1 and Wild type mice. Increased GFAP expression could be associated with the elevation in number of reactive astrocytes. IL-3 is involved in inflammation and ABDF1 intervenes normally in the transport across cell membranes and both were found up-regulated in APP/PS1 mice compared to Wild type mice. Furthermore, CCR5 expression was decreased and both CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines were highly expressed indicating a possible gliosis and probably an increase in chemotaxis from lymphocytes and T cell generation. We also noted for the first time, a CCR8 increase expression with diminution of its CCL1 chemokine, both normally involved in protection from bacterial infection and demyelination. Control of inflammatory proteins will be the next step in understanding the progression of AD and also in determining the mechanisms that can develop in this disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that occurs mainly with aging. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques, intraneuronal tangles, and activation of glial cells [1] [2] [3] [4] . Glial swelling and astrogliosis are a characteristic reaction of astrocytes to inflammation, oxidative stress and trauma, leading to the secretion of several potentially toxic products, including inflammatory agents [1] and oxidative stress mediators [5] . Data from our laboratory have shown the possible pathway to increase mitochondriogenesis and anti-inflammatory proteins to recover from amyloid beta (Aβ) action in primary culture neural cells [6] . Aβ deposition can result in brain damage but whether different chemokines in brain could participate in the Aβ-induced brain damage and neurodegeneration is unclear. Our study evaluates first, if changes in young and old-mice behavior occur. Second, whether changes in chemokine expressions, which act in inflammatory processes with chemotaxis and infiltration across blood-brain barrier (BBB), take place in transgenic APP/PS1 mice aged 7 months and 22-24 months, as we demonstrated previously in cells in primary culture [6] [7] [8] [9] . Chemokine signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy but the involvement of the chemokine CC motif ligand 1 (CCL1) and chemokine CC motif receptor 8"

Successive occurrence of recombinant infectious bronchitis virus strains in restricted area of Middle East,"Routine molecular diagnostic testing by our laboratory, based on using a primer pair with conservative binding sites on the spike glycoprotein coding sequence, has indicated the recurring of a unique phylogenetic cluster of chicken infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) in the Middle East since 2010. The nearly full-length S1 subunit of the spike gene phylogeny of selected strains, however, split up this grouping, suggesting potential recombination in the S1 gene. In order to clarify this, various bioinformatic analyses of the strains were carried out, which confirmed this supposition. Two patterns of recombination were found among the strains, one of which could also be identified in GenBank-deposited IBV sequences from the region. These findings demonstrate that IBV strains of different recombinant patterns occur simultaneously in the same geographic region and could circulate for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the knowledge on IBV evolution.","Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, contagious disease characterized primarily by respiratory signs, and consequently, by reduced weight gain and higher susceptibility to bacterial infections in growing chickens, while in hens decrease in egg production and quality is often observed. It is caused by the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Jackwood, Hall and Handel 2012; Jackwood and de Wit 2013) . Some strains of IBV are strongly nephropathogenic, and may cause nephrosis-nephritis, urolithiasis, and mortality (Jackwood and de Wit 2013) . The disease occurs worldwide and pose significant economic burden to the poultry industry. Protection against the disease mainly relies on vaccination, which, however, is complicated by the high mutation rate and recombinations in the viral genome, especially when these affect immunologically important epitopes, such as the ones present in the spike viral glycoprotein (S) gene (Thor et al. 2011; Jackwood, Hall and Handel 2012) . As a result, several genotypes and serotypes of IBV exist and evolve over time, some of which persist and spread, while others disappear shortly. This variation undermines vaccinal protection against IB due to insufficient or the lack of cross-protection between the serotypes."
Prevalence of canine coronavirus (CCoV) in dog in Japan: detection of CCoV RNA and retrospective serological analysis,"We collected rectal swabs from dogs in Japan during 2011 to 2014, and canine coronavirus (CCoV) nucleocapsid gene was detected by RT-PCR. The relationship between CCoV infection and the manifestation of diarrhea symptoms was investigated, and a correlation was noted (df=1, χ 2 =8.90, P<0.005). The types of CCoV detected in samples from CCoV-infected dogs were CCoV-I in 88.9% and CCoV-II in 7.4%, respectively. We retrospectively investigated the seroprevalence of CCoV-I in dogs in Japan during 1998 to 2006. The sera were tested with a neutralizing antibody test. In the absence of CCoV-I laboratory strain, we used feline coronavirus (FCoV)-I that shares high sequence homology in the S protein with CCoV-I. 77.7% of the sera were positive for neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibodies.","Coronavirus is a single positive-strand RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 30kbp and has been classified into the Family Coronaviridae, Subfamily Coronavirinae. Subfamily Coronavirinae is further classified into 4 genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [4] . Canine coronavirus (CCoV) of the Genus Alphacoronavirus and canine respiratory coronavirus of the Genus Betacoronavirus have been identified in dogs [4] ."
Viral Infection of Transgenic Mice Expressing a Viral Protein in Oligodendrocytes Leads to Chronic Central Nervous System Autoimmune Disease,"One hypothesis for the etiology of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease is that infection by a virus sharing antigenic epitopes with CNS antigens (molecular mimicry) elicits a virus-specific immune response that also recognizes self-epitopes. To address this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated that express the nucleoprotein or glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as self in oligodendrocytes. Intraperitoneal infection with LCMV strain Armstrong led to infection of tissues in the periphery but not the CNS, and the virus was cleared within 7-14 d. After clearance, a chronic inflammation of the CNS resulted, accompanied by upregulation of CNS expression of MHC class I and II molecules. A second LCMV infection led to enhanced CNS pathology, characterized by loss of myelin and clinical motor dysfunction. Disease enhancement also occurred after a second infection with unrelated viruses that cross-activated LCMV-specific memory T cells. These findings indicate that chronic CNS autoimmune disease may be induced by infection with a virus sharing epitopes with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and this disease may be enhanced by a second infection with the same or an unrelated virus. These results may explain the association of several different viruses with some human autoimmune diseases.","T he concept of molecular mimicry has been proposed for the etiology of autoimmune diseases (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In molecular mimicry, a pathogen such as a virus shares peptide sequences or conformations with a host protein. The immune response to the viral infection results in a cross-reactive autoimmune attack against a target tissue expressing the mimicked protein. To date, molecular mimicry has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (6) , ankylosing spondylitis (7), Guillain-Barre syndrome (8) , primary biliary cirrhosis (9) , and multiple sclerosis (MS) 1 (10) (11) (12) , but has yet to be conclusively shown to be the initiating factor of these autoimmune diseases."
,"such as complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), making human IgG1 a natural and desirable choice for therapeutic antibody development in oncology. Considerable effort has focused on improving the stability and Fc function of this IgG1 subclass through protein and glycan engineering. 2-8 Twenty-two of 27 FDA approved therapeutic antibodies belong to the human IgG1","In human serum, immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) is the most abundant subclass among all IgGs. Two-thirds of all IgGs contain the kappa (κ) light chain (Lc) isotype, with the remainder containing the lambda (λ) Lc. 1 This well-studied structure provides a relatively stable scaffold, as well as unique Fc effector functions optimization of biophysical properties is a critical success factor for the developability of monoclonal antibodies with potential therapeutic applications. the inter-domain disulfide bond between light chain (Lc) and heavy chain (Hc) in human IgG1 lends structural support for antibody scaffold stability, optimal antigen binding, and normal Fc function. Recently, human IgG1λ has been suggested to exhibit significantly greater susceptibility to reduction of the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond relative to the same disulfide bond in human IgG1κ. to understand the molecular basis for this observed difference in stability, the sequence and structure of human IgG1λ and human IgG1κ were compared. Based on this Lc comparison, three single mutations were made in the λ Lc proximal to the cysteine residue, which forms a disulfide bond with the Hc. We determined that deletion of S214 (dS) improved resistance of the association between Lc and Hc to thermal stress. In addition, deletion of this terminal serine from the Lc of IgG1λ provided further benefit, including an increase in stability at elevated pH, increased yield from transient transfection, and improved in vitro antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). these observations support the conclusion that the presence of the terminal serine of the λ Lc creates a weaker inter-chain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, leading to slightly reduced stability and a potential compromise in IgG1λ function. our data from a human IgG1λ provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of deleting terminal serine from λLc on the stability and function of other human IgG1λ antibodies."
"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine San Diego, California, USA Epidemiological surveillance of land borders in North and South America: a case study","This study aims to analyze the different binational/multinational activities, programs, and structures taking place on the borders of Brazil and the U.S. between 2013 and 2015. A descriptive exploratory study of two border epidemiological surveillance (BES) systems has been performed. Two approaches were used to collect data: i) technical visits to the facilities involved with border surveillance and application of a questionnaire survey; ii) application of an online questionnaire survey. It was identified that, for both surveillance systems, more than 55% of the technicians had realized that the BES and its activities have high priority. Eighty percent of North American and 71% of Brazilian border jurisdictions reported an exchange of information between countries. Less than half of the jurisdictions reported that the necessary tools to carry out information exchange were available. Operational attributes of completeness, feedback, reciprocity, and quality of information were identified as weak or of low quality in both systems. Statements, guidelines, and protocols to develop surveillance activities are available at the U.S.-Mexico border area. The continuous systematic development of surveillance systems at these borders will create more effective actions and responses.","The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza (H1N1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) hit the world with a high pathogenic potential in recent years, providing a warning to nations of the speed with which these epidemics can move across the globe 1-3 .

Elevated thrombopoietin and platelet indices confirm active thrombopoiesis but fail to predict clinical severity of puumala hantavirus infection,We evaluated the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and procoagulant changes in relation with clinical variables in a cohort of patients with acute hantavirus disease.,"Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family of Bunyaviridiae. In humans, they give rise to a spectrum of illnesses called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HCPS carries a mortality rate of 40%, whereas the mortality in HFRS is lower (0.4%-15%), but the incidence of HFRS is substantially higher. Classically, HFRS occurs in 5 distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric, and convalescent. Capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) are the key elements in the pathogenesis of HFRS. Specific treatment is not available for hantavirus infection. [1] Low platelet count is a hallmark of hantavirus disease, but the severity of bleeding symptoms varies according to the hantavirus species. Signs of bleeding can be noted in up to one-third of the patients infected with the most common European hantavirus, Puumala virus (PUUV). Hemorrhage has been documented in various organs in fatal cases, [2] and mild mucocutaneous involvement has been reported in general. However, thromboembolic complications and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported to associate with PUUVinduced HFRS in Swedish patients. [3, 4] The individual balance between enhanced and hampered coagulation prevails and remains challenging."
,"Neutrophils, immune cells crucial for protecting against invading pathogens, are important in sepsis. Neutrophil migration is regulated by chemokine receptors and their cognate ligands. Our previous study investigated the effect of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. The present study stimulated neutrophils with LPS to explore the influence of LPS on cell. Neutrophils were then pretreated with n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis followed by LPS to examine the effect of this extract on neutrophil chemotaxis. The results showed that LPS decreased the expression levels of CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)1, CXCR2 and L-selectin (CD62L), and increased the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by neutrophils. The addition of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis inhibited this LPS-induced downregulation of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L, and decreased the expression of IL-8 on neutrophils. In addition, n-butanol extract promoted myeloperoxidase activity in neutrophils. Taken together, LPS downregulated the expression of chemokine receptors, leading to the failure of neutrophils to migrate to sites of infection. The addition of n-butanol extract, which promoted the ability of neutrophils to migrate, is a natural product and potential therapeutic agent with which to target neutrophil chemotaxis during LPS stimulation.","Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with a high rate of mortality (1) . The incidence of sepsis has been increasing over the last two decades. This increase has been more marked in developed countries, where 6-30% of patients in Intensive Care Units suffer from sepsis (2) . Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in patients in Intensive Care Units (3) and the associated burden of care incurs financial burden. However, the pathogenesis of sepsis remains to be fully delineated and effective therapies are lacking. A state of immunosuppression induced by sepsis has been demonstrated in clinical and experimental sepsis (3) , with the majority of patients who have succumbed to sepsis-associated mortality showing evidence of immunosuppression and unresolved septic foci (4) ."
Macrophage Polarization in Inflammatory Diseases,"Diversity and plasticity are two hallmarks of macrophages. M1 macrophages (classically activated macrophages) are pro-inflammatory and have a central role in host defense against infection, while M2 macrophages (alternatively activated macrophages) are associated with responses to anti-inflammatory reactions and tissue remodeling, and they represent two terminals of the full spectrum of macrophage activation. Transformation of different phenotypes of macrophages regulates the initiation, development, and cessation of inflammatory diseases. Here we reviewed the characters and functions of macrophage polarization in infection, atherosclerosis, obesity, tumor, asthma, and sepsis, and proposed that targeting macrophage polarization and skewing their phenotype to adapt to the microenvironment might hold great promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","Macrophages were first identified by Elie Metchnikoff as phagocytic cells which helped to eliminate pathogens in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In 1905, his research findings suggested that macrophages from infected animals had elevated ability of killing bacteria, thereby proposing the basis of the concept of macrophage activation [1] . After six decades of efforts, the mechanisms with regard to killing bacteria of macrophages were gradually elucidated, but there were still no definite answers about how macrophages became more efficient bacterial killers. In 1973, North and his colleagues found that independent cellular factors could also promote resistance of infection without involvement of pathogens [2] . Almost at the same time, David indicated that lymphocytes were the major antigen-specific cells responsible for microbicidal activation of macro-phages [3] . Soon after that, interferon (IFN)-γ, produced by lymphocytes, was identified as the first factor for interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes [4] . It transforms resting macrophages into active ones which have stronger antigen presenting capacity and complement mediated phagocytosis, and secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as toxic mediators. As the first type of antimicrobial macrophage activation was recognized, it became known as classically activated macrophages (CAM, also known as M1)."
The potential of the human immune system to develop broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies: implications for vaccine development,"Objectives and design: Developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing HIV-1 human antibodies (bnAbs) remains a challenging goal. Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various strategies employed by the virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels by deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs).","Since the discovery of HIV-1 in the early 1980s, an effective HIV-1 vaccine that can elicit bnAbs has yet to be developed. Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various mechanisms for viral escape from human immune surveillance, including genetic alterations, oligomerization of envelope (Env) glycoproteins, We and others have demonstrated that known HIV-1 bnmAbs had uncommon properties compared with bnmAbs against other microbes, including extensive somatic maturation and lack of measurable binding activity of their putative germline antibodies to Envs [13, 15, 16, 18, 27, 28] , suggesting that HIV-1 infection or vaccination with HIV-1 Envs may not initiate the somatic maturation processes of the putative germline Abs to bnAbs. Deep sequencing of the cDNA-PCR products of memory B cells obtained from several 'elite controllers' at different time points postinfection further revealed the limited use of heavy chain V-gene (IGHV) lineages for developing HIV-1 bnAbs in a single infected individual [17, 18, 29] . The infrequency of developing bnAbs in natural infection, the uncommon properties of known HIV-1 bnmAbs, the confined usage of IGHV lineages for developing bnAbs in a single infected individual and the failure in inducing the same or similar bnmAbs by vaccine immunogens prompted us to investigate the human antibody gene repertoire for the availability of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs at both genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels and the possibility for existence of alternative germline antibody genes that may potentially mature to HIV-1 bnAbs. The gDNAs of peripheral B cells in uninfected human individuals presumably possess the initial rearranged antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation upon infection or vaccination. We hypothesized that antibody gene repertoire at the gDNA level may be more diverse than that at the cDNA level. Therefore, we developed a methodology for constructing large combinatorial gDNA antibody libraries and constructed one large nonimmune gDNA library using the PMBCs obtained from 300 uninfected healthy humans and three immune gDNA libraries using the PBMCs obtained from three HIV-1-infected 'elite controllers'. Their corresponding cDNA libraries were simultaneously constructed. We compared the antibody gene repertoires of the four gDNA antibody libraries with those of the corresponding cDNA libraries by deep sequencing. Sequence analysis results suggest that the frequencies of the putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low, but alternative germline antibody genes may be explored to elicit HIV-1 bnAbs."
Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), an incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) degrading enzyme, contains two forms and it can exert various physiological functions particular in controlling blood glucose through the action of GLP-1. In diabetic use, the DPP-4 inhibitor can block the DDP-4 to attenuate GLP-1 degradation and prolong GLP-1 its action and sensitize insulin activity for the purpose of lowering blood glucose. Nonetheless the adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors severely hinder their clinical applications, and notably there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources including chemical synthesis, herbs, and plants with fewer side effects. In this review, we highlight various strategies, namely computational biology (in silico), in vitro enzymatic and cell assays, and in vivo animal tests, for seeking natural DPP-4 inhibitors from botanic sources including herbs and plants. The pros and cons of all approaches for new inhibitor candidates or hits will be under discussion.","According to the statistics from International Diabetes Federation (IDF), there were 425 million diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in 2017 worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 629 million by 2045. 1 Abnormally high blood glucose caused by insulin insufficiency or insensitivity can lead to severe complications such as chronic renal failure, microvascular complication, cerebrovascular accident, and infarction induced by high glycated serum and blood vessel proteins. 2, 3 Moreover, insufficient insulin signal leads to the decreased glucose uptake from the blood that, in turn, can result in ulcers, gangrene, diabetic retinopathy, and neuropathy. 2 Recent DM treatment is inclined to maintain the blood glucose level within normal limits by (e.g. nutritional therapy and physical management) and medication due to the incurable nature of DM. 4, 5 Diabetic medications can be characterized into five strategies based on their acting mechanisms: raising insulin secretion (e.g. sulfonylurea and meglitinide analogs), reducing intestinal glucose absorption (e.g. acarbose), triggering insulin-independent glucose uptake signaling (e.g. thiazolidinedione and biguanide), reducing urinal glucose reabsorption (e.g. gliflozins), and prolonging insulin sensitive [e.g. dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists] [American Diabetes Association, 2019b]. These antidiabetic drugs help DM patients to maintain their blood glucose levels with various adverse effects (Table 1) , such as urine-tract infection, lactoacidosis, hypoglycemia, and obesity. These drug-related adverse effects can deteriorate the quality of life of DM patients and create unsurmountable difficulties for proper dosing regimens in a clinical setting. It has been observed that DPP-4 inhibitors can exert a similar efficacy in reducing blood glucose levels without severe adverse effects such as hypoglycemia as compared with sulfonylurea. 6 Nevertheless, The perceptions of natural compounds against dipeptidyl peptidase 4 in diabetes: from in silico to in vivo various adverse side effects associated with the current DPP-4 inhibitor can still be observed that, in turn, can severely limit their practical application. As such, there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources including chemical synthesis and botanic sources containing herbs and plants with fewer side effects. In this article, we have reviewed various approaches including in silico, in vitro enzymatic and cell assays, and in vivo animal tests in the search for natural DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
Evidence of translation efficiency adaptation of the coding regions of the bacteriophage lambda,"Deciphering the way gene expression regulatory aspects are encoded in viral genomes is a challenging mission with ramifications related to all biomedical disciplines. Here, we aimed to understand how the evolution shapes the bacteriophage lambda genes by performing a high resolution analysis of ribosomal profiling data and gene expression related synonymous/silent information encoded in bacteriophage coding regions.","Because of a major advantage of being a diverse group of easily manipulated viruses, bacteriophages have various potential uses both in fundamental research and in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. For example, they are used as vehicles for vaccines (both DNA and protein), for the detection of pathogenic bacterial strains, and as a display system for many proteins and antibodies. [1] [2] [3] [4] Furthermore, phages were also suggested to be used as biocontrol agents in agriculture and petroleum industry, and as alternatives to antibiotics in the case of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. In addition, they often serve as model organisms in molecular evolution studies. [1] [2] [3] [4] Therefore, understanding the way the viral fitness is encoded in the genetic material of bacteriophages (or other type of viruses) is an important and challenging mission that may potentially contribute to all biomedical disciplines. [1] [2] [3] [4] Deciphering the regulatory information encoded in the genomes of phages or other viruses, and the relation between the nucleotides composition of the coding regions and the viral fitness is a very challenging mission, which was tackled, in the recent years, by various researchers. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Among others, it was suggested that ribosome profiling, which enables the large in vivo genome wide monitoring of ribosome state at a resolution of single nucleotide, is a very useful tool for deciphering the coding complexity of viral (and other organisms) genomes. Specifically, it was shown that ribosome profiling enables detecting novel (possibly very short) coding regions and estimate the translation status of various open reading frames. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Here, we focus on the Bacteriophage lambda which is a wellknown and studied member of the Siphoviridae family of doublestranded DNA viruses in the Caudovirales order (also known as 'tailed bacteriophages' due to their characteristic form). During its lifecycle this phage either resides within the genome of its Escherichia coli host through lysogeny or enters into a lytic phase (which lasts $25 min) during which it produces progeny viral particles, and kills and lyses the cell (see for example 14, 15 ). The genome size of the bacteriophage lambda is $50 kb nt and includes 66 known genes that were analysed in this study. These genes can be divided into two groups, 'early' and 'late' according to the stages in the lytic phase when their expression is dominant. 9 The specific aim of this study is at exploring the way in which translation efficiency related information is encoded on a synonymous level in the coding regions of genes that are expressed during different bacteriophage lambda development stages (i.e. 0-20 min after the beginning of the lytic phase). Some previous studies shed some light on specific elements related to this topic. For example, a recent study by Liu et al. 9 employed ribosome profiling to study the progress of bacteriophage lambda gene expression during phage development and showed that the known genes are expressed in a predictable fashion; in addition many previously unknown potential open reading frames were detected. Other studies focused on different aspects of viral translation (and lifecycle in general) regulation that has a significant effect on shaping viral genomes, such as: secondary structures within viral transcripts (mainly in untranslated regions 16, 17 but also within coding regions [18] [19] [20] ) and evolutionary pressure on synonymous codons usage bias. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to perform a comprehensive, large scale analysis of different types of genomic synonymous information related to regulation of translation efficiency in all coding regions of a bacteriophage lambda, during different stages of its development. In particular, basing on the analysis of ribosome profiling data, 9 we demonstrated, for the first time, the condition specific adaptation of the bacteriophage codons in early/late genes to the intra-cellular E. coli environment during the different stages of phage development."
Randomized controlled trial of the effect of regular paracetamol on influenza infection,"Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults aged 18-65 years with influenza-like illness and positive influenza rapid antigen test. Treatments were 1 g paracetamol four times a day, or matching placebo, for 5 days. Pernasal swabs were taken for influenza quantitative RT-PCR at Baseline and Days 1, 2 and 5. Temperature and symptom scores were recorded for 5-14 days or time of resolution respectively. The primary outcome variable was area under the curve (AUC) for quantitative PCR log10 viral load from Baseline to Day 5.","Seasonal and pandemic influenza infection is an important public health issue. 1, 2 Effective strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza are a global health priority. 3 International guidelines recommend fever treatment with antipyretics during influenza infection with the qualification that they 'may help and are unlikely to cause harm'. 4 However fever is a beneficial adaptive physiological response to infection that may confer a survival benefit so that, in fact, treating fever with anti-pyretics could be harmful. 5 In animals, treatment with anti-pyretic drugs increases mortality in viral, 6 bacterial 7 and parasitic 8 infections. A meta-analysis of the effect of anti-pyretic drug therapy in animal models of influenza infection found an increased risk of mortality, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.04-1.73). 9 In humans paracetamol prolongs infection in varicella zoster, 10 malaria 11 and rhinovirus, 12 and impairs immune responses. 12, 13 There have been no previous randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of antipyretic therapy on human influenza infection."
The First Case of Feline Infectious Peritonitis-like Pyogranuloma in a Ferret Infected by Coronavirus in Japan,"A male ferret, which was purchased from abroad at 9 months of age, had shown significant weight loss starting at 13 months of age. The ferret subsequently showed decreasing motor activity and recumbency and was euthanized at 14 months of age. At necropsy, a white, quail egg-sized mass was found in the mesentery. Histopathologically, multifocal granulomas consisting of necrotic foci, macrophages, fibroblasts and plentiful fibrous connective tissues were observed in the mesenteric mass. Surrounding the granulomas, inflammatory cell infiltration consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasmacytes was observed diffusely and significantly. Immunohistochemistry revealed small numbers of macrophages around necrotic foci that were positively stained for antimouse feline coronavirus. Electron microscopically, the cytoplasm of the macrophages contained viral particles, which were identified as coronavirus. The histopathological features in this ferret were similar to those in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). This was the first case in ferrets in Japan. (J Toxicol Pathol 2010; 23: 99-101) ","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease in cats and some non-domestic felids that is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) 1 . This virus is included in the Coronaviridae family, a group of enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses 1 . Although FIP manifests itself in effusive or noneffusive forms, the basic lesion is the same, a pyogranulomatous inflammation and vasculitis 1 . Testing by immunofluorescence assay, ELISA, electron microscopy, RT-PCR and sequence analysis may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of FIP 1,2 ."
Detection of infectious bronchitis virus strains similar to Japan in Taiwan,"A total of 1,320 tracheal samples from 66 broiler flocks sent to slaughterhouses and 42 tracheal samples from 42 flocks of local chickens in the field were collected for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) gene detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using nucleocapsid-specific primers and spike-specific primers. Prevalence in broiler flocks was 39.4% (26/66) and in local chicken flocks was 11.9% (5/42). Several IBVs similar to Japan were detected in Taiwan. One-direction neutralization revealed that the reference antisera did not offer protection against the IBVs similar to those from Japan.","Gammacoronavirus, and its genome encodes four structure proteins, spike glycoprotein (S), and membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2, 11] . New variant IBV strains in chickens continually emerge worldwide owing to the high mutation rate of its genome [4] . Various vaccines have been developed but the disease still occurs, because different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect and vaccine failures are often associated with the emergence of antigenic variants that differ from the vaccine viruses [9, 14] ."
"Adenovirus 2, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Parainfluenza Molecular Diagnostic Assay Results in Puppies After vaccination with Modified Live Vaccines","Background: Canine adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, and Bordetella bronchiseptica cause respiratory disease in dogs, and each has a modified live intranasal vaccine available. Molecular diagnostic assays to amplify specific nucleic acids are available for each of these agents. If positive molecular diagnostic assay results are common after vaccination, the positive predictive value of the diagnostic assays for disease would be decreased.","I nfectious causes of respiratory disease are common in dogs; canine distemper virus, adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, influenza, herpesvirus, pneumovirus, respiratory coronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, various Mycoplasma spp., and Streptococcus equi var. zooepidemicus are documented causes. 1 Molecular diagnostic assays to detect viral and bacterial pathogens are available for these agents. In the United States, modified live vaccines (MLVx) for intranasal (IN) administration are currently available for adenovirus 2, B. bronchiseptica, and parainfluenza. These vaccines do not induce sterilizing immunity, and vaccinated dogs can still develop clinical signs of disease if exposed to virulent strains of the organisms. 2 It is currently unknown if IN administration of MLVx against these agents results in positive molecular diagnostic assay results in dogs without previous vaccination. If transient positive molecular diagnostic assay results are common after vaccination, the positive predictive value of the diagnostic assays to predict disease caused by these agents in dogs would be decreased."
Long non-coding RNA MEG3 attends to morphine-mediated autophagy of HT22 cells through modulating ERK pathway,"Context: Morphine is an alkaloid isolated from the poppy plants. The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 mM morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times), LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times) expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases. Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.","Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing neuropsychiatric disease manifested by uncontrolled drug-seeking and drug-taking (Yager et al. 2015; Koskela et al. 2017) . It can be comprehended as a neuropathological process caused by drug stimulation, results in the construction of obsessive drug-seeking behaviour (Robbins and Everitt 2002) . Due to the molecular mechanism related to drug addiction is very complex and mysterious (Kenny 2014; Sun et al. 2016) , it believes that studying the biological mechanism of drug addiction is of great significance for the treatment and intervention of drug addiction."
Cathepsin W Is Required for Escape of Influenza A Virus from Late Endosomes,"Human cathepsin W (CtsW) is a cysteine protease, which was identified in a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen to be required for influenza A virus (IAV) replication. In this study, we show that reducing the levels of expression of CtsW reduces viral titers for different subtypes of IAV, and we map the target step of CtsW requirement to viral entry. Using a set of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CtsW, we demonstrate that knockdown of CtsW results in a decrease of IAV nucleoprotein accumulation in the nuclei of infected cells at 3 h postinfection. Assays specific for the individual stages of IAV entry further show that attachment, internalization, and early endosomal trafficking are not affected by CtsW knockdown. However, we detected impaired escape of viral particles from late endosomes in CtsW knockdown cells. Moreover, fusion analysis with a dual-labeled influenza virus revealed a significant reduction in fusion events, with no detectable impact on endosomal pH, suggesting that CtsW is required at the stage of viral fusion. The defect in IAV entry upon CtsW knockdown could be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type CtsW but not by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CtsW, suggesting that the proteolytic activity of CtsW is required for successful entry of IAV. Our results establish CtsW as an important host factor for entry of IAV into target cells and suggest that CtsW could be a promising target for the development of future antiviral drugs.","cysteine proteases of the papain superfamily that are involved in numerous cellular functions, such as regulation of apoptosis or establishment of inflammatory processes (19) . CtsW, together with cathepsin F, belongs to a relatively new subgroup of F-like cathepsins which is distinct from the well-studied cathepsin Band L-like subgroups (20) . Cathepsins B and L were shown to be required for Ebola virus entry by cleaving the viral glycoprotein in the endosomal compartment (21) . Moreover, inhibition of cathepsin L also resulted in inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection (22, 23) , whereas cathepsin B has been implicated in entry of Nipah virus (24) . In contrast to cathepsins B and L, nothing is known about the possible function of CtsW in viral infections. While cathepsins B and L are lysosomal enzymes, CtsW was found to localize predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in HeLa, COS-7, and natural killer (NK) cells (25, 26) . Its high expression in CD8 ϩ T cells and NK cells and its upregulation by interleukin 2 (IL-2) also distinguish CtsW from the other members of the family (25) . It was observed that CtsW is not needed for the effector function of these cells (26) , so the question of the function of CtsW remains unanswered."
Nucleoside analogs as a rich source of antiviral agents active against arthropod-borne flaviviruses,"Nucleoside analogs represent the largest class of small molecule-based antivirals, which currently form the backbone of chemotherapy of chronic infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B or C viruses, and herpes viruses. High antiviral potency and favorable pharmacokinetics parameters make some nucleoside analogs suitable also for the treatment of acute infections caused by other medically important RNA and DNA viruses. This review summarizes available information on antiviral research of nucleoside analogs against arthropod-borne members of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae, being primarily focused on description of nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyltransferase, and helicase/NTPase. Inhibitors of intracellular nucleoside synthesis and newly discovered nucleoside derivatives with high antiflavivirus potency, whose modes of action are currently not completely understood, have drawn attention. Moreover, this review highlights important challenges and complications in nucleoside analog development and suggests possible strategies to overcome these limitations.","The genus Flavivirus belongs to the Flaviviridae family and includes more than 70 single-stranded plus-sense RNA viral species. Flaviviruses of human medical importance are tick-or mosquito-transmitted viruses with typical representatives being tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), Powassan virus (POWV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), or Zika virus (ZIKV). 1, 2 The Flaviviridae family also includes some less known or neglected viruses, such as louping ill virus (LIV), Usutu virus, Langat virus, or Wesselsbron virus. [3] [4] [5] [6] The flaviviral genome is a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA of about 11 kb in length that encodes a single polyprotein, which is coand posttranslationally processed into three structural (capsid, premembrane or membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). 7 Both NS3 and NS5 proteins possess enzymatic activities reported to be important targets for antiviral development. Whereas NS3 acts as a serine protease, a 5 0 -RNA triphosphatase, a nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), and a helicase, 8, 9 NS5 consists of a complex containing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the methyltransferase (MTase) activities. 10, 11 Flaviviral infections are accompanied by a wide spectrum of distinct clinical manifestations, ranging from relatively mild fevers and arthralgia to severe viscerotropic symptoms (YFV and DENV), hemorrhagic fevers (KFDV and OHFV), encephalitis/myelitis (JEV, WNV, and TBEV), and neuropathic or teratogenic manifestations (ZIKV). More than 200 million clinical cases of flaviviral infections, including numerous deaths, are reported annually worldwide. 12 Currently no specific antiviral therapies are available to treat patients with flaviviral infections, thus the search for safe and effective small-molecule inhibitors that would be active against these viruses represents a high research priority. 13 Nucleoside analog inhibitors have figured prominently in the search for effective antiviral agents. 14 Nucleoside analogs are synthetic, chemically modified nucleosides that mimic their physiological counterparts (endogenous nucleosides) and block cellular division or viral replication by impairment DNA/RNA synthesis or by inhibition of cellular or viral enzymes involved in nucleoside/tide metabolism ( Figure 1 ). 15 The first antiviral analogs were developed in the late 1960s and currently there are over 25 approved therapeutic nucleosides used for the therapy of viral infections of high medical importance, such as HIV/AIDS (tenofovir), 16, 17 hepatitis B (lamivudine/entecavir), 18, 19 hepatitis C (sofosbuvir), 20 or herpes infections (acyclovir). 21 So far, numerous nucleoside analogs have been described to inhibit arthropod-transmitted flaviviruses. Since these viruses are closely related to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), for which many potent inhibitors are being currently developed, anti-HCV nucleoside analogs represent promising tools to be repurposed against other viruses within the Flaviviridae family. 12 The aim of this review is to provide an overview of known antiviral agents targeting selected arthropodborne flaviviruses and to discuss their characteristic properties, modes of action, and advantages or limitations of their therapeutic use. Moreover, the important challenges and complications in antiflavivirus nucleoside analog development are highlighted and possible strategies to overcome their shortcomings are suggested."

Co-localization of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in the respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues of pigs and llamas,"This study investigated the co-localization of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) across respiratory and lymphoid organs of experimentally MERS-CoV infected pigs and llamas. Also, scanning electron microscopy was performed to assess the ciliary integrity of respiratory epithelial cells in both species. In pigs, on day 2 post-inoculation (p.i.), DPP4-MERS-CoV co-localization was detected in medial turbinate epithelium. On day 4 p.i., the virus/receptor co-localized in frontal and medial turbinate epithelial cells in pigs, and epithelial cells distributed unevenly through the whole nasal cavity and in the cervical lymph node in llamas.","September 8th, 2018, South Korea reported the first MERS-CoV case since the end of an outbreak in 2015, suggesting that MERS-CoV is still a worldwide threat (WHO, 2018) ."
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct inflammation-induced microglia signatures Editor: Achim Breiling Transaction Report,"Thank you for the transfer of your research manuscript to EMBO reports. I now went through the referee reports from The EMBO Journal. Both referees acknowledge the potential interest of the findings. Nevertheless, both referees have raised a number of concerns and suggestions to improve the manuscript, or to strengthen the data and the conclusions drawn. As the reports are below, I will not detail them here.","1. It is not clear why the authors have chosen the regimen of one LPS injection instead of several injections which leads to neurodegeneration as described e.g. by Bodea et al. (2014) . The relevance of the study for neurodegenerative diseases -if there is any -should be increased by adding the following points: a. Analyse LPS-injected mice once the acute stimulus has resided to evaluate whether microglia stay ""primed"" or whether they return to their homeostatic state. b. Repeat the LPS injection to see whether the acclaimed neurodegenerative microglia signature (Bodea et al., 2014) can be triggered and associate this gene signature to the acutely treated mice. c. Comparing transcriptome signatures in two distinct genotypes, one being a model of Alzheimer's disease (in the case of DAM) could lead to a bias. The differences which the authors describe could simply reflect the distinct microglia properties inherent to the respective model. To be able to effectively compare the two populations it would be necessary to re-run the RNASeq analysis comparing the effects of LPS injection on microglia phenotypes with states of microglia in the Alzheimer model in the same laboratory with the same platform."
Phenobarbital-induced anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome in a cat,"In this study, we document a case of phenobarbital-induced anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS), which has been rarely reported in veterinary medicine. A 2-yearold, 5.4 kg, neutered male Russian Blue cat was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and started on phenobarbital treatment. Eight days after initiation of phenobarbital treatment, the cat showed tachypnea and hyperthermia. CBC and serum biochemistry were unremarkable. However, the patient showed high serum amyloid A (SAA). On abdominal ultrasonography, generalized enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes and splenic multiple hypo-echoic nodules, which were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy were found. The cat was diagnosed with AHS, and phenobarbital was discontinued. After 10 days of cessation, the patient had normal SAA, and clinical signs were resolved.","The patient was a two-year-old, male, castrated, Russian Blue cat, and was admitted for emergency care because of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (four times a day). On the day of admission, physical and neurological examinations were performed, and significant findings related to the clinical symptoms were not found. In addition, there were no specific findings on complete blood count (CBC). Serum chemistry analysis yielded values within normal range, except for elevated glucose (239 mg/dl; reference range, 60-130 mg/dl) and creatine kinase (CK; 373 U/l; reference range, 0-314 U/l). All electrolyte levels were also within normal range. Serum amyloid A (SAA) was high at 17.3 mg/l (reference range, 0-5 mg/l) and no abnormalities were found in the coagulation test and thyroid function test. Feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies (IDEXX Laboratories, Markham, Ontario), and feline parvo virus kit (BioNote Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Korea) were negative. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging did not yield any specific findings related to the clinical symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology tests were normal, and infectious agents (Bartonella spp., Cryptococcus spp., feline Coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii) were excluded using IDEXX Feline Neurologic RealPCR Panel. Through the process of these clinical examinations and laboratory tests, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg; Samjin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was infused intravenously as an emergency medicine, and phenobarbital (Hana Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was loaded with 15 mg/kg (divided into three times) intravenous injection. Epileptic seizures were stopped and phenobarbital was prescribed 2.5 mg/kg two times daily per oral for 2 weeks."
Ethical Perspectives on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Epidemic in Korea,"Ethical considerations are essential in planning for and responding to outbreaks of infectious diseases. During the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea in 2015, serious challenges emerged regarding important ethical issues, such as transparency and the protection of privacy. The development of bioethics in Korea has been influenced by individualistic perspectives applied in clinical contexts, leading to a paucity of ethical perspectives relevant to population-level phenomena such as outbreaks. Alternative theories of public health ethics include the perspectives of relational autonomy and the patient as victim and vector. Public health actions need to incorporate clear and systematic procedures founded upon ethical principles. The MERS-CoV epidemic in Korea created significant public support for more aggressive early interventions in future outbreaks. This trend makes it all the more imperative for ethical principles and procedures to be implemented in future planning and responses to outbreaks in order to promote perceptions of legitimacy and civic participation.","Ethical considerations have been embedded in plans made throughout the world for outbreaks and pandemics [1] [2] [3] [4] . Lessons from past epidemics warn that without ethical safeguards, public health measures can inadvertently encroach on human rights and values [5] . The incorporation of relevant ethical principles in pandemic planning can help enhance voluntary cooperation based upon public trust, and reduce the undesirable outcomes of public health measures [1] ."
Chest Computed Tomography Abnormalities and Their Relationship to the Clinical Manifestation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in a Genetically Confirmed Outbreak,"Studies reporting chest images of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in an outbreak setting and their relationship to the clinical manifestation are limited. During a genetically confirmed RSV outbreak, eight patients underwent both chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). Among these, 5 cases had newly appearing abnormalities on CT, although chest X-ray was able to detect abnormalities in only 2 cases (40%). Although bronchial wall thickening was common, other findings and their distribution were variable, even in an outbreak setting. All patients with both a history of anticancer chemotherapy against hematological cancer and lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, sputum, and hypoxemia, had abnormalities on CT, suggesting that these two factors might be important for predicting the existence of LRTI in RSV-infected patients.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is well known as a virus causing lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants and immunocompromised adults (1) (2) (3) . Bronchopneumonia patterns are common findings of RSV-induced LRTI (RSV-LRTI); however, RSV-LRTI often shows variable findings on chest imaging (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Although some factors, such as the virulence of RSV and host immune status, might affect the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of RSV-LRTI (12, 13) , the detailed mechanisms remain unknown."
Molecular pathology of emerging coronavirus infections,"Respiratory viruses can cause a wide spectrum of pulmonary diseases, ranging from mild, upper respiratory tract infections to severe and life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections, including the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Viral clearance and subsequent recovery from infection require activation of an effective host immune response; however, many immune effector cells may also cause injury to host tissues. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, with 10% and 35% overall mortality rates, respectively; however, >50% mortality rates are seen in the aged and immunosuppressed populations. While these viruses are susceptible to interferon treatment in vitro, they both encode numerous genes that allow for successful evasion of the host immune system until after high virus titres have been achieved. In this review, we discuss the importance of the innate immune response and the development of lung pathology following human coronavirus infection.","Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can arise after many types of injury to the lung, including sepsis, mechanical and chemical injury and bacterial and viral infections [1] . In ALI, the mortality rate is in the range 20-30%, with about 55% of the cases progressing to ARDS within a few days. ARDS causes significant morbidity and approximately 40% mortality, resulting in ∼75 000 deaths/year in the USA alone [2] . In the past two decades, five emerging viruses have been known to cause significant ARDS-related mortality, including influenza H1N1 2009 and, in particular, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. In this review we focus on mechanisms of coronavirus-induced lung pathogenesis and ARDS."
"Milieu-induced, Selective Aggregation of Regulated Secretory Proteins in the trans-Golgi Network","1 . Abbreviations used in this paper: BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; CgB, chromogranin B ; GAG chain, glycosaminoglycan chain ; hsPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase ; SgH, secretogranin II ; TGN, trans-Golgi network .","Abstract. Regulated secretory proteins are thought to be sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via selective aggregation . The factors responsible for this aggregation are unknown . We show here that two widespread regulated secretory proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (granins), remain in an aggregated state when TGN vesicles from neuroendocrine cells (PC12) are permeabilized at pH 6.4 in 1-10 mM calcium, conditions believed to exist in this compartment. Permeabilization of immature secretory granules under these conditions allowed the recovery of electron dense cores. The granin aggregates in the TGN largely ex-HE mechanism by which constitutive and regulated secretory proteins are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN)' is poorly understood (for review see iB urgess and Kelly, 1987) . It has been postulated that a key step in this sorting process is the selective aggregation of regulated, but not constitutive, secretory proteins in the TGN (Kelly, 1985; Burgess and Kelly, 1987; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Huttner et al ., 1988; Gerdes et al., 1989; Huttner and Tooze, 1989; Tooze et al., 1989) . This hypothesis is largely based on morphological data showing that regulated secretory proteins form electron-dense cores in the TGN (for review see Farquhar and Palade, 1981; Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al ., 1987) . Aggregation of a protein inevitably segregates it from proteins that do not aggregate but remain in solution in the fluid phase that is excluded from the aggregate. Thus, if aggregation is a key step in the sorting of secretory proteins, the crucial questions arising are: (a) why does aggregation occur specifically in the TGN ; and (b) why is the aggregation selective for regulated secretory proteins?"
Molecular Mimicry of Human Cytochrome P450 by Hepatitis C Virus at the Level of Cytotoxic T Cell Recognition,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) type 2, which is defined by the presence of type I antiliver kidney microsome autoantibodies directed mainly against cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 and by autoreactive liver infiltrating T cells. Virus-specific CD8 ϩ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that recognize infected cells and contribute to viral clearance and tissue injury during HCV infection could be involved in the induction of AIH. To explore whether the antiviral cellular immunity may turn against self-antigens, we characterized the primary CTL response against an HLA-A * 0201-restricted HCV-derived epitope, i.e., HCV core 178-187, which shows sequence homology with human CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 8-17. To determine the relevance of these homologies for the pathogenesis of HCV-associated AIH, we used synthetic peptides to induce primary CTL responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors and patients with chronic HCV infection. We found that the naive CTL repertoire of both groups contains cross-reactive CTLs inducible by the HCV peptide recognizing both CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 peptides as well as endogenously processed CYP2A6 protein. Importantly, we failed to induce CTLs with the CYPderived peptides that showed a lower capacity to form stable complexes with the HLA-A2 molecule. These findings demonstrate the potential of HCV to induce autoreactive CD8 ϩ CTLs by molecular mimicry, possibly contributing to virus-associated autoimmunity.","A utoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 1 is a chronic liver disease of unknown etiology characterized by a persistent inflammatory reaction in the liver. The hallmarks of AIH are high titers of serum autoantibodies against different autoantigens and the presence of a hepatic, predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate associated with liver cell damage. Several reports have shown the presence of autoreactive T cells in AIH patients. CD4 ϩ or CD8 ϩ liver-infiltrating T cells proliferate in response to autologous hepatocytes and some of them express high cytolytic activity (1) . Peripheral T cell clones from AIH patients also proliferate in response to liver-specific lipoprotein and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (2) . Type 2 AIH is defined by the presence of type I antiliver kidney microsome antibodies (LKM-1) recognizing cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 (3). In the liver and blood of patients with AIH type 2, CD4 ϩ and CD8 ϩ autoreactive T cells recognizing CYP2D6 have been detected, indicating a role of T cells in the pathogenesis of this disease (4, 5) . AIH type 2 appears to be epidemiologically linked to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Some patients with AIH type 2 have been shown to be positive for anti-HCV antibodies (6) and also for HCV RNA (7) , suggesting that HCV may cause a secondary autoimmune response. MHC class I-restricted CD8 ϩ CTLs are a major defense mechanism in viral infections. It has been suggested that the CTL response may This work was presented in part at the 5th International Meeting on Hepatitis C Virus and Related Viruses in Venice, Italy, June 25-28, 1998. contribute to viral clearance as well as to liver cell injury during HCV infection and might therefore play a role in the induction of autoreactive antibodies and CD4 ϩ helper T cells. CTLs recognize endogenously processed antigenic peptides in combination with MHC class I molecules presented on the cell surface. Several HCV-derived immunogenic CTL epitopes have been described thus far (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Amino acid sequence comparison of HLA-A2-restricted HCV-derived CTL epitopes revealed the presence of two human CYP sequences related to HCV core 178-187, i.e., (Table I) . Compared with the HCV core 178 epitope, they display an eight amino acid sequence identity, one conservative substitution at the NH 2 -terminal anchor position (Leu to Val), and one nonconservative substitution at position 6 (Ser to Val or Ser to Ala). Both CYP sequences still contain the HLA-A2 binding motif, because both Leu and Val can serve as anchor residues (14, 15) . Therefore, the HCV core 178 peptide is a candidate for molecular mimicry, that is, similarity of infectious agents with host antigens. Such similarity may lead to an inability of the host immune system to recognize the foreign antigen or it may lead to an autoreactive immune response at the level of antibodies or T cells (16) (17) (18) ."
ORMA: a tool for identification of species-specific variations in 16S rRNA gene and oligonucleotides design,"16S rRNA gene is one of the preferred targets for resolving species phylogenesis issues in microbiological-related contexts. However, the identification of single-nucleotide variations capable of distinguishing a sequence among a set of homologous ones can be problematic. Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences.","During the last decades, different nucleic-acid-based detection techniques have been developed in order to employ identification based on single-nucleotide variations in both genotyping and detection experiments on a multiplicity of targets. These techniques allowed distinguishing alleles and correctly assessing the genotype at the singlebase level."
Primary bronchial carcinoma associated with bone marrow metastasis and paraneoplastic monoclonal gammopathy in a cat Case Report,"Case summary Herein we describe an unusual metastatic pattern and paraneoplastic manifestation of a bronchial carcinoma in a cat. An 8 year-old cat presented with a diminished appetite, dysphagia, weight loss, lethargy and coughing. Thoracic radiographs revealed a lung mass. Bronchial carcinoma was diagnosed on the basis of histology and was associated with a lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the fibrovascular stroma. Biochemistry showed hyperproteinaemia. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a narrow spike in the gamma region. Bone marrow cytology revealed an infiltrate with numerous clustered epithelial cells. The cat was euthanased 2 months later because of anorexia and poor general condition. Relevance and novel information To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical description of primary bronchial carcinoma associated with bone marrow metastases and paraneoplastic monoclonal gammopathy in a cat.","A monoclonal gammopathy is identified by the presence of a narrow spike both in the beta (β) region and gamma (γ) region on serum protein electrophoresis. Clonal immunoglobulins are produced by a single B-lymphocyte clone, which yields an excessive amount of immunoglobulins or subunits thereof, such as kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) light chains and heavy chains. 1 Tumours support a complex microenvironment characterised by many immune cell populations, reflecting the capacity of the immune system to interact with tumour cells. 2 In human lung cancers, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are positively correlated with a pathological complete response rate and increased patient survival. 2, 3 TILs may be classed as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) recently identified in human solid-organ tumours, including lung-cell carcinomas. 2, 3 Primary lung tumours are rare in cats and represent a sporadic geriatric disease with a mean age of onset of 12 years, an incidence of 2.2 per 100,000 cats 4 and an overall prevalence of less than 0.5%. 5 In cats, the most commonly recognised primary lung tumours are adenocarcinomas. 6 We describe a case of primary bronchial carcinoma in a cat associated with bone marrow suppression and a paraneoplastic monoclonal gammopathy."
Effects of ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor on the expression levels of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in mice with viral myocarditis,"Effects of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) inhibitor MG-132 on the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β1 in mice with viral myocarditis were investigated to analyze the correlation of myocardial tissue score of mice between TNF-α and TGF-β1. Eighty healthy male SPF mice aged 6 weeks were selected and 20 mice were randomly selected as the blank group. The blank group did not receive any intervention. Mortality rates of each group were recorded and compared on day 8 of modeling, and heart specimens from the remaining mice were histopathologically examined and the expression of mRNA and protein of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissues were detected by western blot analysis. Correlation between mouse myocardial histopathologic scores and expression of protein of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissues, as well as the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissue in VMC mice was analyzed. The expression levels of myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and protein of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in the blank and control group were significantly lower than those in the VMC and the MG-132 group. The myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and TNF-α and TGF-β1 protein in the MG-132 group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P<0.05). The expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 protein in myocardial tissues was positively correlated with the pathological score in myocardial tissue of mice (r=0.843, P<0.05; r=0.763, P<0.05), and there was a positive correlation between the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 protein in myocardial tissues of VMC mice (r= 0.672, P<0.05). UPS inhibitor MG-132, which can significantly alleviate the myocardial injury of VMC mice, reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in myocardial tissues, and improved the survival rate of mice, thus it is a potential new treatment for VMC.","Viral myocarditis (VMC), as one of the most common cardiac infectious diseases, is mainly caused by myocardial cells infected with the virus, causing localized or diffuse inflammation of the myocardium. The virus causes direct damage to the myocardial cells and stimulates the immune response, thus causing sustained damage to the myocardial tissues (1, 2) . Coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) is the most important virus that causes myocarditis. CVB3 can induce oxidative stress response and apoptosis in a few weeks in the pathogenesis of VMC, resulting in arrhythmia, myocardial failure and may eventually lead to sudden death, but special treatment of VMC has not been found as yet (3, 4) . Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), as an important ATP-dependent protein control system in eukaryotic cells, not only participates in physiological processes such as apoptosis, inflammatory response and intracellular signaling, but also plays an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis (5) (6) (7) . In recent years, studies have found that UPS not only plays an important role in the inflammatory response of various diseases, but also plays a key role in the occurrence and development of various viral infectious diseases (8, 9) . As an aldehyde peptide proteasome inhibitor that can inhibit the activity of chyme protein, MG-132 also has a protective effect on the occurrence of inflammatory reactions in many diseases (10) . As a cytokine with a variety of biological effects produced by macrophages, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been shown to play an important role in the inflammatory response of VMC (11) . However, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an initiating factor synthesized from the extracellular matrix of collagen fibers, and it is also one of the many factors leading to the occurrence of viral myocarditis (11) ."
The Rubella Virus E2 and E1 Spike Glycoproteins Are Targeted to the Golgi Complex,Rubella virus (RV) has been reported to,"bud from intracellular membranes in certain cell types. In this study the intracellular site of targeting of RV envelope E2 and E1 glycoproteins has been investigated in three different cell types (CHO, BHK-21 and Vero cells) transfected with a cDNA encoding the two glycoproteins. By indirect immunofluorescence, E2 and E1 were localized to the Golgi region of all three cell types, and their distribution was disrupted by treatment with BFA or nocodazole. Immunogold labeling demonstrated that E2 and E1 were localized to Golgi cisternae and indicated that the glycoproteins were distributed across the Golgi stack. Analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained from stably transfected CHO cells revealed that E2 and E1 become endo H resistant and undergo sialylation without being transported to the cell surface. Transport of RV glycoproteins to the Golgi complex was relatively slow (tta = 60-90 min). Coprecipitation experiments indicated that E2 and E1 form a heterodimer in the RER. E1 was found to fold much more slowly than E2, suggesting that the delay in transport of the heterodimer to the Golgi may be due to the slow maturation of E1 in the ER. These results indicate that RV glycoproteins behave as integral membrane proteins of the Golgi complex and thus provide a useful model to study targeting and turnover of type I membrane proteins in this organdie."
OAS-RNase L innate immune pathway mediates the cytotoxicity of a DNA-demethylating drug,"Drugs that reverse epigenetic silencing, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-azacytidine (AZA), have profound effects on transcription and tumor cell survival. AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase Ldependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZAinduced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.","D NA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi's) have been investigated as potential cancer therapeutic agents for at least 45 y (1). Methylation of cytosine residues in CpG islands of DNA results in epigenetic silencing of transcription, while removal of these methyl groups has the opposite effect of promoting transcription (2) . Currently, the DNMTi's 5-azacytidine (AZA) and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) are approved for myelodysplastic syndromes, and also improve survival in acute myeloid leukemia (3) (4) (5) (6) . In addition, DNMTi's are under investigation for the treatment of various solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast and colorectal cancer (7, 8) . DNMTi's deplete cellular levels of DNA methyltransferases, leading to DNA hypomethylation and wide-ranging effects on cancer cells (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, there remains a critical need to better understand the molecular mechanisms for the antitumor and cytotoxic effects of DNMTi's, to increase their clinical efficacy while minimizing toxicity."
Diauxic shift-dependent relocalization of decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1 to polysomal complexes,"Dhh1 and Pat1 in yeast are mRNA decapping activators/translational repressors thought to play key roles in the transition of mRNAs from translation to degradation. However, little is known about the physical and functional relationships between these proteins and the translation machinery. We describe a previously unknown type of diauxic shiftdependent modulation of the intracellular locations of Dhh1 and Pat1. Like the formation of P bodies, this phenomenon changes the spatial relationship between components involved in translation and mRNA degradation. We report significant spatial separation of Dhh1 and Pat1 from ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, biochemical analyses reveal that these proteins are excluded from polysomal complexes in exponentially growing cells, indicating that they may not be associated with active states of the translation machinery. In contrast, under diauxic growth shift conditions, Dhh1 and Pat1 are found to co-localize with polysomal complexes. This work suggests that Dhh1 and Pat1 functions are modulated by a relocalization mechanism that involves eIF4A. Pulldown experiments reveal that the intracellular binding partners of Dhh1 and Pat1 change as cells undergo the diauxic growth shift. This reveals a new dimension to the relationship between translation activity and interactions between mRNA, the translation machinery and decapping activator proteins.","Recent years have seen recognition that a diversity of post-transcriptional control mechanisms influences the rate and regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Yet our understanding of the interplay between the component processes of post-transcriptional gene expression is very limited. A prime example is the relationship between translation and mRNA degradation, which is not only fundamental to the correct functioning of gene expression but also a potential cause of disease if defective. It has been proposed that translational repression, as for example observed under stress conditions, is a key step in promoting mRNA decapping, thus leading to the formation of P bodies (1, 2) . P bodies, like stress granules, are RNA/protein foci that form under certain (mostly stress-related) conditions in eukaryotic cells. P bodies generally contain non-translating mRNAs as well as the mRNA decapping machinery, Lsm1-7, the 5 0 -3 0 exonuclease Xrn1 and other RNA-binding proteins (3) , although the physical nature and degree of heterogeneity of P body populations is unclear."
Potential mechanism and drug candidates for sepsis-induced acute lung injury,"The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and identify more effective therapeutic strategies to treat it. The gene expression data set GSE10474 was downloaded and assessed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis, functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis of DEGs were performed. Furthermore, potential target drugs for key DEGs were assessed. A total of 209 DEGs, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. A number of DEGs, including zinc finger and BTB domain containing 17 (ZBTB17), heat shock protein 90 kDa β, member 1 (HSP90B1) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR α were identified. Furthermore, gene ontology terms including antigen processing and presentation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma were identified. In addition, a differential co-expression network containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D4, putative and tubulin, γ complex associated protein 3 was constructed. Furthermore, a number of gene-drug interactions, including between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5'-diphosphate and radicicol, were identified. Therefore, DEGs, including ZBTB17 and HSP90B1, may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Furthermore, drugs including adenosine-5'-diphosphate may be novel drug candidates to treat patients with ALI.","Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life threatening condition. The major clinical manifestations of ALI include inflammatory cell infiltration, arterial hypoxaemia and pulmonary oedema (1) . The prognosis of patients with ALI is poor and the mortality rate of such patients remains high (35-45%) (2) ."

PEDV-diseased piglets shed high concentrations of infection-competent PEDV particles in their faeces . As reported for other Coronaviridae this suggests that the surface structure of these PEDV particles stays intact in environments other than faeces (Hofmann and Wyler 1989; Lai et al. 2015) . Rescue of infectious PEDV from several feed ingredients and additives was reported recently, showing that PEDV stays viable in other environments than faeces (Dee et al. 2014) ."
"Emerging Zoonoses: the ""One Health Approach""","Zoonoses represent a public health risk recently pointed out by the spreading of previously unknown human infectious diseases emerging from animal reservoirs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza caused by H5N1-virus. These outbreaks have shown that animal breeding activities can pose a significant public health risk. Until now, the risk of zoonoses has probably been underestimated, particularly in occupational settings. The emergence or re-emergence of bacterial (Mycobacterium bovis and Brucella spp) or viral (hepatitis E virus) infections shows that zoonoses should be considered as emerging risks in agricultural and animal breeding and should be addressed by specific preventive interventions.

The Role of Macrophage Polarization in Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases,"Macrophages, found in circulating blood as well as integrated into several tissues and organs throughout the body, represent an important first line of defense against disease and a necessary component of healthy tissue homeostasis. Additionally, macrophages that arise from the differentiation of monocytes recruited from the blood to inflamed tissues play a central role in regulating local inflammation. Studies of macrophage activation in the last decade or so have revealed that these cells adopt a staggering range of phenotypes that are finely tuned responses to a variety of different stimuli, and that the resulting subsets of activated macrophages play critical roles in both progression and resolution of disease. This review summarizes the current understanding of the contributions of differentially polarized macrophages to various infectious and inflammatory diseases and the ongoing effort to develop novel therapies that target this key aspect of macrophage biology.","1 Macrophages (Mφ) represent a ubiquitous yet complex and nuanced population of immune cells that play essential roles in both disease and homeostasis throughout the body (Hume, 2008) . In addition to monocytes and Mφ circulating throughout the bloodstream, specialized tissue-resident Mφ can be found in most major organs, including Kupffer cells in the liver, Langerhans cells in the skin, microglia in the brain, splenic red pulp Mφ, lung alveolar Mφ, adipose tissue Mφ, and bone osteoclasts, to name a few (Davies et al., 2013; Gautier et al., 2012; Ji et al., 2013; You et al., 2013) . While some identify these populations as the endpoint of bone marrow monocyte maturation, several lines of evidence indicate that tissue resident Mφ originate during embryogenesis in association with their specific tissue independently from blood monocytes and monocytes/Mφ recruited to sites of inflammation (Davies et al., 2013; Gomez and Geissmann, 2013; Schulz et al., 2012) . Regardless of their location, Mφ are responsible for the maintenance of healthy tissues through phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells and foreign materials and through tissue repair and remodeling during wound healing (Duffield, 2005; Ghavami et al., 2014; Majai et al., 2014; Mantovani et al., 2013) . Mφ are also major regulators of the inflammatory response to disease and infection, acting as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity by monitoring the microenvironment through an array of surface receptors and secreting appropriate cytokines and chemokines (Heydtmann, 2009; ."
Influenza Virus A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) Replicates Efficiently in the Upper and Lower Respiratory Tracts of Cynomolgus Macaques,"In March 2013, three fatal human cases of infection with influenza A virus (H7N9) were reported in China. Since then, human cases have been accumulating. Given the public health importance of this virus, we performed a pathogenicity study of the H7N9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model, focusing on clinical aspects of disease, radiographic, histological, and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed transient, mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration. Virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract, with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation. Virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat. Histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans, albeit less severe, with diffuse alveolar damage, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, formation of hyaline membranes, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibroproliferative changes. Analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during H7N9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication. Overall, H7N9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans, supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human H7N9 infection (H. N. Gao et al., N. Engl.","mitted, albeit inefficiently, via respiratory droplets or aerosols in the ferret model (10) (11) (12) (13) . In order to allow a better estimation of the effect of a potential H7N9 pandemic, we studied the A/Anhui/ 1/2013 strain of this virus in the cynomolgus macaque model. This model was chosen because it most closely reflects the human physiology and the development of pneumonia, cytokine, and chemokine responses (14) , and the pattern of attachment of H7N9 virus to respiratory tissues of macaques was recently shown to be more similar to that in humans than that in other frequently used animal models (15) . Upon inoculation with influenza virus A/Anhui/ 1/2013, cynomolgus macaques developed transient, moderate disease with virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The emerging H7N9 influenza virus was more pathogenic than seasonal influenza A virus and most isolates of the pandemic H1N1 virus but not as pathogenic as the 1918 Spanish influenza virus or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in cynomolgus macaques. year-old cynomolgus macaques (4 male and 4 female) were inoculated with 7 ϫ 10 6 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) via a combination of ocular, oral, intranasal, and intratracheal inoculation as described previously (16) . Animals started to show signs of disease at 1 day postinoculation (dpi). Clinical disease peaked at 3 and 4 dpi (Fig. 1A) and was moderate. Six out of 8 animals showed obvious respiratory signs, such as increased respiration rates, abdominal breathing, and coughing (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Nasal discharge and cough were noted in only one animal. Hematologic and blood chemical analyses did not reveal any abnormalities during the course of infection (data not shown)."
"Hepatitis B virus upregulates host expression of α-1,2- mannosidases via the PPARα pathway Basic Study","To assess the effects of hepatitis B virus (HBV) on the expression of host α-1,2-mannosidases and determine the underlying mechanisms.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common chronic viral infection in the world. An estimated 2 billion people are infected, and more than 350 million are chronic carriers of the virus [1] . Due to an insufficient immune response, some individuals with HBV infection can develop chronic hepatitis, which can eventually result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While the underlying mechanisms for HBV-induced chronic hepatitis remain unclear, several studies indicate that dendritic cell (DC) function is impaired in patients with chronic hepatitis B [2, 3] . DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that can present antigen to T cells and activate naive T cells. Multiple receptor molecules on the surface of DCs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), participate in the recognition and uptake of pathogens, and can regulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules [4] . In particular, DCspecific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important CLR that is mainly expressed on the surface of mature and immature DCs [5] . DC-SIGN plays an important role in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [5] . Moreover, previous studies have shown that DC-SIGN is involved in the immune escape of multiple pathogenic microorganisms, including HIV-1, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue fever virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), SARS-coronavirus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, fungus, and some parasites [6, 7] . Unfortunately, the mechanisms behind immune escape mediated by DC-SIGN remain unclear. It may be that DC-SIGN directly recognizes mannose oligosaccharides found on the viral envelope of HBV. Through modifications to these mannose oligosaccharides on its viral envelope, HBV could potential evade the host immune system. Indeed, it has been shown that DC-SIGN does not recognize wild-type HBV but does recognize a high-mannose type HBV produced by the application of a class Ⅰ α-mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine [8, 9] . Moreover, in our previous studies, we found that the high-mannose type HBV could promote the maturation of DCs, increase IL-12 secretion, and effectively stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, and that these effects were blocked by specific anti-DC-SIGN antibodies [10] . Therefore, demannosylation appears to be beneficial to HBV to escape DC-SIGN recognition and avoid the consequent immune elimination. Demannosylation of glycoproteins occurs through a family of mannosidases that trim mannan in the N-oligosaccharide. Human Class Ⅰ α-mannosidases include the ER α-1, 2-mannosidase I (MAN1B1), and three Golgi α-1,2-mannosidases, namely α-mannosidase IA (MAN1A1), α-mannosidase IB (MAN1A2), and α-mannosidase IC (MAN1C1). Generally, MAN1B1 firstly trims α-1,2-mannose from Man9GlcNAc2-Asn, and then MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 trim the residual α-1,2-mannose, to generate Man5GlcNAc2-Asn. These processes are dependent on the varying levels of the mannosidase subtypes in different cell types [11] . There are glycosylation sites on the surface of HBV envelope proteins, which could be glycosylated by the host [12] . Therefore, it is not surprising that HBV infection has previously been shown to upregulate the expression of ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidases (EDEMs) in order to increase demannosylation [13] . However, few studies have investigated the effects of HBV on the expression of class Ⅰ α-mannosidases."
Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes: A Functional Genomics Tool for the Study of Positive-strand RNA Viruses,"Reverse genetics, an approach to rescue infectious virus entirely from a cloned cDNA, has revolutionized the field of positive-strand RNA viruses, whose genomes have the same polarity as cellular mRNA. The cDNA-based reverse genetics system is a seminal method that enables direct manipulation of the viral genomic RNA, thereby generating recombinant viruses for molecular and genetic studies of both viral RNA elements and gene products in viral replication and pathogenesis. It also provides a valuable platform that allows the development of genetically defined vaccines and viral vectors for the delivery of foreign genes. For many positive-strand RNA viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), however, the cloned cDNAs are unstable, posing a major obstacle to the construction and propagation of the functional cDNA. Here, the present report describes the strategic considerations in creating and amplifying a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) using the following general experimental procedures: viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, cDNA subcloning and modification, assembly of a full-length cDNA, cDNA linearization, in vitro RNA synthesis, and virus recovery. This protocol provides a general methodology applicable to cloning full-length cDNA for a range of positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a genome of >10 kb in length, into a BAC vector, from which infectious RNAs can be transcribed in vitro with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase.","For RNA virologists, the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late 1970s made it possible to convert viral RNA genomes into cDNA clones, which could then be propagated as plasmids in bacteria for the genetic manipulation of RNA viruses. 1 The first RNA virus to be molecularly cloned was bacteriophage Qβ, a positive-strand RNA virus that infects Escherichia coli. A plasmid containing a complete cDNA copy of the Qβ genomic RNA gave rise to infectious Qβ phages when introduced into E. coli. 2 Shortly thereafter, this technique was applied to poliovirus, a positive-strand RNA virus of humans and animals. A plasmid bearing a full-length cDNA of the poliovirus genomic RNA was infectious when transfected into mammalian cells and capable of producing infectious virions. 3 In this ""DNA-launched"" approach, the cloned cDNAs should be transcribed intracellularly to initiate viral RNA replication; however, it is unclear how the transcription is initiated and how the transcripts are processed to the correct viral sequence. This concern has led to the development of an alternative ""RNA-launched"" approach, whereby a complete cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome is cloned under a promoter recognized by an E. coli or phage RNA polymerase for the production of synthetic RNAs in vitro with defined 5' and 3' termini, which undergo the complete viral replication cycle when introduced into host cells. 4, 5 The first success with this approach was reported for brome mosaic virus, 6 ,7 a positive-strand RNA virus of plants. Since then, the RNA-launched approach has been developed for a wide range of positive-strand RNA viruses, including caliciviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, arteriviruses, and coronaviruses. 1, 4, 5, 8 In both the DNA-and RNA-launched reverse genetics systems, the construction of a full-length cDNA clone is the key to generating infectious DNA or RNA of positive-strand RNA viruses, but it becomes a considerable technical challenge as the size of the viral genome increases. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In particular, a large RNA genome of ~10-32 kb presents three major obstacles to the cloning of a full-length functional cDNA. 18 The first difficulty is the synthesis of a faithful cDNA copy, since the fidelity of RT-PCR is inversely proportional to the length of the viral RNA. The second hurdle is the presence of potentially toxic sequences, since long RNA molecules are more likely to contain unexpected sequences capable of making the cDNA fragment in plasmids unstable in E. coli. The third and most critical issue is the availability of a suitable vector, since it is difficult to find a cloning vector that can house a viral cDNA insert of >10 kb. Over the past three decades, these barriers have been overcome by several advances in enzymology, methodology, and vectorology. 1, 4, 5, 8 Of these, the most promising and innovative development is the cloning of large positive-strand RNA viruses as infectious bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). The BAC vector is a low-copy cloning plasmid (1-2 copies/cell) based on the E. coli fertility factor, with an average DNA insert size of ~120-350 kb. 19 2. Assemble a set of the four modified, overlapping cDNAs into a single full-length SA 14 -14-2 BAC (pBAC/SA 14 -14-2) by joining at three natural restriction sites (BsrG I, BamH I, and Ava I) in a sequential manner using the five-step cloning procedures detailed in Protocols 3.1-3.5 ( Figure 1E) ) in a 6-well plate. 7. After 4-6 hr of incubation, overlay the cells with 0.5% agarose in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Incubate the plates for 4 days at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . 8. Visualize the infectious centers (plaques) by fixation with 7% formaldehyde and staining with 1% crystal violet in 5% ethanol 27 (Figure 6A ). "
Open Forum Infectious Diseases Infectious Complications After Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation for Hematological Malignancy,"Background. Umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) is used for patients who do not have a matched donor, but engraftment often takes longer than with a standard allogeneic transplant, likely increasing the risk for infection. We characterized specific infections and outcomes in adults undergoing UCBT at our 2 centers.","Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells are a suitable source of stem cells for patients who require hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and who do not have a matched donor [1] . The use of UCB cells has been mostly studied in children with hematological malignancies, but it has extended to the adult population because of the paucity of related or matched donors [1, 2] . Advantages to using UCB cells for HCT include the ability to use human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched cells without significant adverse effects on graft function and the decreased incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantation [1, 3] . However, both the decreased quantity of cells available for transplantation and the immunological immaturity of UCB cells have been linked to delayed engraftment after UCB transplant (UCBT) [3, 4] ."
Use of noninvasive ventilation at the pulmonary infection control window for acute respiratory failure in AECOPD patients A systematic review and meta-analysis based on GRADE approach Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Medicine ® OPEN 1,The aim of the study was to comprehensively examine the efficacy and safety of noninvasive ventilation used at the pulmonary infection control (PIC) window for acute respiratory failure (ARF) in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).,"Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) developing acute respiratory failure (ARF) require invasive mechanical ventilation to assist spontaneous breath and sustain life. [1, 2] Although it is effective, observational studies have indicated that protracted invasive ventilation may pose the risk of complications such as sinusitis, [3] respiratory muscle weakness, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). [4] VAP has been closely related to increasing mortality and morbidity. [1, 5] To mitigate complications associated with prolonged invasive ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation, that is, shifting from invasive support to noninvasive support in patients considered ready to be extubated but not ready for removal of mechanical ventilation, [6] has been investigated to be of benefit in reducing duration of invasive ventilation, incidence of VAP, and mortality rate. [2, 7] Meanwhile, optimizing the timing for using noninvasive ventilation is a key factor in the successful treatment of ARF in AECOPD patients. [8] Premature extubation and immediate application of noninvasive ventilation will cause loss of airway protection, respiratory muscle overload and fatigue, as well as suboptimal gas exchange, [9] while deferred use of noninvasive support may increase the risk of adverse complications. Therefore, an optimal timing must be carefully chosen to achieve the balance between the potential risk associated with early removal of invasive ventilation and delayed application of noninvasive ventilation. The pulmonary infection control (PIC) window, recently identified by Wang et al, [10] may be selected as an appropriate timing for replacing invasive ventilation with noninvasive ventilation. After receiving invasive ventilation and adequate antibiotics for 6 to 7 days, the patient' s pulmonary infection is substantially controlled when the following indices are present: significant decrease in infectious infiltrations demonstrated by lung radiography; noticeable changes of phlegm (less amount, lower tenacity, and lighter or white color); and at least one or more following signs: body temperature <37.5°C, peripheral white blood count (WBC) <10 Â 10 9 /L, or WBC reduced by 2 Â 10 9 /L. [10, 11] This period of time is referred to the PIC window. Previous studies [10, 12] indicated that noninvasive ventilation used at this timing significantly reduced duration of invasive ventilation, VAP, and hospital death for AECOPD patients with ARF. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [13] [14] [15] found no significant differences on mortality, weaning failures, or reintubation rates between patients receiving noninvasive ventilation and those continuing invasive ventilation. But a recent meta-analysis [16] found that using noninvasive ventilation at the PIC window was associated with lower mortality, lower VAP incidence, and shorter invasive ventilation time."
CXCL9 promotes prostate cancer progression through inhibition of cytokines from T cells,"Chemokines have been demonstrated to serve an important role in a variety of diseases, particularly in tumor progression. There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However, the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2'-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF-β was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion, CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.","Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor that occurs in prostate tissue, which is the result of abnormal dysplasia of prostate acinar cells. In regions such as Europe and the United States, prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy; the mortality rate has exceeded lung cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer has gradually increased with the arrival of China's aging population and the extension of life and diet changes (1) . It is also known that prostate cancer-associated fatalities frequently occur in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although several novel drugs for castration-resistant prostate cancer have been approved, each of these has prolonged survival by just a few months. Therefore, novel treatments of prostate cancer are required to extend life expectancy even further."
Identification of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus- Like Virus in a Leaf-Nosed Bat in Nigeria,"Bats are reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses that can have a profound impact on human and animal health, including lyssaviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs).

Whereas the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are associated with diseases of mammals, including humans, the gammacoronaviruses are implicated chiefly in diseases of birds. Interest in coronaviruses was largely focused on their impact on domestic porcine and avian husbandry and their utility in animal models of virus-induced demyelination (5) until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (6) . Thereafter, with recognition of the causative agent SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (7) (8) (9) (10) and of the presence of SARS-CoV-like viruses in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) (11) , efforts to explore the genetic diversity of coronaviruses and their host range intensified (12) ."
Animal viral diseases and global change: bluetongue and West Nile fever as paradigms,"Environmental changes have an undoubted influence on the appearance, distribution, and evolution of infectious diseases, and notably on those transmitted by vectors. Global change refers to environmental changes arising from human activities affecting the fundamental mechanisms operating in the biosphere. This paper discusses the changes observed in recent times with regard to some important arboviral (arthropod-borne viral) diseases of animals, and the role global change could have played in these variations. Two of the most important arboviral diseases of animals, bluetongue (BT) and West Nile fever/encephalitis (WNF), have been selected as models. In both cases, in the last 15 years an important leap forward has been observed, which has lead to considering them emerging diseases in different parts of the world. BT, affecting domestic ruminants, has recently afflicted livestock in Europe in an unprecedented epizootic, causing enormous economic losses. WNF affects wildlife (birds), domestic animals (equines), and humans, thus, beyond the economic consequences of its occurrence, as a zoonotic disease, it poses an important public health threat. West Nile virus (WNV) has expanded in the last 12 years worldwide, and particularly in the Americas, where it first occurred in 1999, extending throughout the Americas relentlessly since then, causing a severe epidemic of disastrous consequences for public health, wildlife, and livestock. In Europe, WNV is known long time ago, but it is since the last years of the twentieth century that its incidence has risen substantially. Circumstances such as global warming, changes in land use and water management, increase in travel, trade of animals, and others, can have an important influence in the observed changes in both diseases. The following question is raised: What is the contribution of global changes to the current increase of these diseases in the world?","Infectious disease can be viewed as a play involving at least two characters: the pathogen and the host. While both roles can be represented by a great variety of performers, pathogens exhibit by far the highest variety and complexity. This review is about viral infections in animals. It aims first to give an idea of the enormous complexity and diversity of the existing infectious agents, emphasizing their extraordinary capacity for change and adaptation, which eventually leads to the emergence of new infectious diseases. Secondly, it focuses on the influence of the environment in this process, and on how environmental (including climate) changes occurring in recent times, have precise effects on the emergence and evolution of infectious diseases, some of which will be illustrated with specific examples. Finally, it describes the recent and dramatic expansion of two of the most important emerging animal viral diseases at present, bluetongue (BT) and West Nile fever/encephalitis (WNF), dealing with their relationship to climate and other environmental changes, particularly those linked to human activities, collectively known as ""global change,"" and that can be at least in part seen a consequence of the ""globalization"" phenomenon."

In addition, infected dogs that visit public parks have opportunities to expose other dogs, as well as humans, to zoonotic bacteria and parasites shed in their feces. Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. are well-documented zoonotic parasites in humans and domestic animals; 6, 7 however, little is known about the prevalence of these enteropathogens in dog populations exposed to higher risk environments such as dog parks and their zoonotic potential in these environments. Humans can be exposed to subclinically infected dogs when removing dog feces from public areas, 8 and infective cysts and oocysts of Giardia and Cryptosporidium, respectively, can persist for prolonged periods in the environment, posing an increased infection risk in areas where environmental contamination is high, such as public dog parks. 4, 7, 8 Dogs that attended a dog park in Fort Collins, Colorado, were significantly more likely to be infected with an intestinal parasite compared to socially active dogs that did not attend dog parks. 9 A seasonal trend for fecal shedding of Giardia in dogs was not demonstrated in a recent study, 10 demonstrating the possibility for year-round risk."

Anti-radiation damage effect of polyethylenimine as a toll-like receptor 5 targeted agonist,"A number of agents are now available for use in protecting against ionizing radiation. These radiationprotective agents, however, have many adverse effects. Efforts have been made to develop new radiationprotective agents for medical application. Here, we investigated whether a compound, polyethylenimine (PEI), which activates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-mediated NF-kB signaling pathways, could have an antiradiation effect on a mouse model. First, a cell-based screening model for an agonist of TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway was established and then validated by activation of TLR5-mediated NF-kB luciferase reporter activity with a known TLR5 agonist, flagellin. We found that PEI induced dose-dependent activation of the TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway, indicating that PEI is indeed a TLR5 agonist. Furthermore, the anti-radiation effect of polyethylenimine was assessed using a γ-ray total body irradiation (TBI) mouse model. Compared with the irradiation control, both survival time and survival rate were significantly improved in mice that received either a low dose of polyethylenimine (P = 0.019) or a high dose of polyethylenimine (P < 0.001). We also observed a positive correlation between animal body weight and survival time in mice that received a low dose of polyethylenimine, a high dose of polyethylenimine and amifostine, over a period of 30 days, r = 0.42 (P < 0.02), 0.72 (P < 0.0001) and 0.95 (P < 0.0001), respectively, while a negative correlation between animal body weight and survival time was observed in the irradiation control (r = -0.89; P < 0.0001). These results indicate that polyethylenimine is a new TLR5 agonist with potential application in offering protection for patients receiving radiotherapy or in radiation-related accidents.","Exposure to ionizing irradiation may result in tissue damage, and have negative impacts on our health and safety. Nuclear accidents can lead to serious social economic issues [1] . The toxicity of ionizing irradiation, described as acute radiation syndrome (ARS) or radiation sickness is caused by total-or partial-body exposure to a high dose of penetrating ionizing radiation over a short period of time. Even at low doses, ionizing irradiation is capable of causing illness, and ARS can occur within hours to days [2] . In clinical medicine, ARS often exists as the adverse side-effect of radiation therapy for cancer and other diseases. Administration of medicine for radiation damage control is one of the most effective and direct approaches to protect and treat the injuries caused by ionizing radiation. Thousands of compounds have been reported to offer potential for radiation protection, but most of them are not suitable for clinical application. There is only a small window of opportunity for administration of chemical drugs, which may be introduced prior to or immediately after irradiation exposure. Biological drugs have poor specificity. Most radio-protective agents have severe toxicity [3, 4] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective compounds that offer radiation protection. The human immune system is one of the most vulnerable systems targeted by radiation and has been a key target for research in radio-protective strategies [5] . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important family of immune receptors. To date, at least 13 human TLRs have been identified and extensively investigated in the immune system of invertebrates. TLRs are important cell surface receptors in the innate immune system and play a vital role in the natural immune system at the initiation stage of multiple immune signaling pathways. It has been reported that TLRs can induce antigen-presenting cell maturation and secretion of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, resulting in a connection between innate immunity and acquired immunity. TLRs can induce strong antigen-specific immune responses [6, 7] ."
Twelve-plex PCR for acute meningitis 44 Original Article Clinical Microbiology Evaluation of the Seeplex ® Meningitis ACE Detection Kit for the Detection of 12 Common Bacterial and Viral Pathogens of Acute Meningitis,"Background: Bacterial meningitis is an infectious disease with high rates of mortality and high frequency of severe sequelae. Early identification of causative bacterial and viral pathogens is important for prompt and proper treatment of meningitis and for prevention of life-threatening clinical outcomes. In the present study, we evaluated the value of the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc., Korea), a newly developed multiplex PCR kit employing dual priming oligonucleotide methods, for diagnosing acute meningitis.","Bacterial meningitis is an infectious disease with high rates of mortality and severe sequelae. Early identification of causative bacterial and viral pathogens is important to enable prompt and appropriate treatment and thereby prevent life-threatening clinical outcomes. Patients with suspected meningitis are generally prescribed antibiotics before hospital admission or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection for examination. However, the admin-istration of antibiotics may render it difficult to culture the causative bacteria, thereby impairing microbiological diagnosis [1, 2] . To counter this problem, alternative methods of molecular identification, including 16S/23S rRNA gene amplification followed by sequencing and real-time PCR, have been developed. However, the clinical application of such techniques is limited because of the presence of interfering bacterial or viral DNA, timeconsuming nature of these assays, and small number of detection channels available on the real-time PCR platform [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ."
ISG20 promotes local tumor immunity and contributes to poor survival in human glioma,"Recent evidence has confirmed that a mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occurs early in gliomagenesis and contributes to suppressed immunity. The present study aimed to determine the candidate genes associated with IDH mutation status that could serve as biomarkers of immune suppression for improved prognosis prediction. Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines. We conclude that ISG20 is a useful biomarker to identify IDH-mediated immune processes in glioma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Glioma is the most common and lethal type of malignancy in the primary central nervous system (CNS). 1 Although patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) have a more favorable prognosis than those with glioblastomas (GBMs), many tend to progress to a higher grade, leading to poor survival. 2 Nevertheless, the outcome of glioma patients is highly variable, even among those with the same tumor grade. 3 Recent analyses demonstrated that an IDH1/2 mutation, encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene, occurs early in gliomagenesis, affecting a common glial precursor cell population. 4 Patients with tumors harboring an IDH1/2 mutation (IDHmut) show significantly longer survival than those expressing wild-type IDH1/2 (IDHwt). [5] [6] [7] IDH mutation leads to a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) by modulating the methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale, changing transcriptional programs and altering the differentiation state. 8 CIMP is associated with microsatellite instability and longer survival in several cancers. 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] IDHmut and IDHwt tumors differ with regards to various biological processes, including immune cell infiltration. [14] [15] [16] [17] Human IDH1-mutant gliomas have less infiltrating immune cells than IDH1-wild type gliomas, with global depletion of immune infiltrates, including microglia, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells. Accordingly, early IDHmut glioma progenitor cells have suppressed immunity compared with IDHwt cells, 4, 15, 18 which may be responsible for their improved clinical outcomes. 15 Moreover, IDHmut tumors have reduced expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated genes and interferon (IFN)-γ-inducible chemokines, as well as suppressed accumulation of T cells in the tumor compared with IDHwt tumors. 16 IDHwt gliomas are also characterized by more prominent regulatory T cell infiltration and higher programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels than IDHmut cases. 17 Although IDH status clearly appears to affect the immune state and progression of glioma, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate these mechanisms and identify the candidate prognostic and/or therapeutic markers, we investigated the differential expression of immune-related genes and their role in glioma progression. In particular, we collected clinical and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases, including 932 glioma samples. We then determined the differentially expressed immune-related genes according to IDH mutation status, analyzed separately for LGG and GBM cases, and performed pathway enrichment analysis for functional annotation."
Sequence analysis of the spike gene of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus isolated from South China during 2011-2015,"The spike gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was sequenced from 55 South China field strains isolated from pigs with symptoms of diarrhea. The sequences were compared within the set of field strains as well as with reference strains available in GenBank. Within the 55 South China PEDV field strains, the deduced amino acid sequence identities ranged from 93.8% to 99.9 % and ranged from 90.7% to 99.5% when compared with the foreign reference strains in GenBank. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that 10 of the 55 South China PEDV strains belonged to G1b and 45 belonged to G2b.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major cause of aqueous diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration in pigs. It is transmitted via direct or indirect fecal-oral routes [10, 14] . As other Coronaviridae members, PEDV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a small 28 kb genome. The genomic RNA has a 5′-cap and a 3′-polyadenylated tail and contains at least seven open reading frames that encode four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [9] . Like other coronaviruses, the S protein is a type 1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein comprising 1,383 amino acids and contains 29 predicted glycosylation sites. The S1 and S2 domains of this protein have essential roles in cellular receptor interactions that mediate viral entry and induce neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [13] . The PEDV S protein consists of three domains: a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. There is a region of the S protein that contains the epitope(s), which is capable of inducing PEDV-neutralizing antibodies [1] . Research indicates that phage-displayed peptides, which were panned against 2C10, have antigenic similarities with the PEDV antigen epitope motif ( 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 ) and can show neutralizing activity against PEDV [6] , the CO-26K equivalent (COE) domain (aa positions 99-638), and the epitopes SS2 (aa positions 748-755) and SS6 (aa positions 764-771), which can also induce neutralizing antibodies against PEDV [4, 25] . Recently, the S gene was implicated as an important determinant of the biological properties of PEDV. These properties include genetic relationships between PEDV isolates, the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field, and associations between genetic mutations and virus function [16] ."

This study was undertaken to better understand the magnitude of the problem of nosocomial respiratory viral infections in adult and pediatric patients.,"Respiratory viruses are transmitted in the hospital setting from direct contact with infected visitors and family, infected healthcare workers, other infected patients, indirectly through contact with contaminated fomites, or from patient-to-patient spread due to poor hand hygiene practices among healthcare providers. The frequency of specific respiratory viruses causing nosocomial infections reflects their activity in the community [1] . Few studies have assessed the outcomes of nosocomial respiratory viral infections in noncritically ill, non-immunocompromised adult and pediatric patients. In one study, 1 in 5 children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) due to a respiratory viral infection had acquired the infection in the hospital. These children had an approximately 6-fold increased likelihood of mortality compared with those who had community-acquired respiratory viral infections [2] . In another pediatric study, 49% of nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred in premature infants [3] . One study in adult patients noted that 24% of nonventilated hospital-acquired pneumonias were caused by viruses [4] . These publications suggest that nosocomial respiratory viral infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. We investigated such cases in our adult and pediatric hospitals to better understand the magnitude of the problem and the outcomes of such infections."
The Utility of Acute-Phase Proteins in the Assessment of Treatment Response in Dogs With Bacterial Pneumonia,"Background: Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are sensitive markers of inflammation, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) recently has been shown to be a useful diagnostic marker in dogs with bacterial pneumonia (BP). In humans with community-acquired pneumonia, APPs also have great utility as follow-up markers aiding in the assessment of treatment response.","B acterial pneumonia (BP) is an acquired inflammation of the lower airways and lung parenchyma secondary to bacterial infection. 1 The clinical characteristics and microbiological findings in dogs with BP have been well described. [2] [3] [4] [5] However, information concerning the normalization of clinical and radiographic findings during the recovery process and guidelines on assessing the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in BP still are limited. 1, 6, 7 Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are a group of blood proteins, mainly produced by the liver, which are part of the innate host defense system. 8 The APPs are involved in the protection against infection as well as in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation, especially in the early phases of injury. 9 The major positive APPs in dogs, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), have low serum concentrations in healthy dogs. Serum concentrations of CRP and SAA increase markedly within the first hours after inflammatory stimuli and normalize quickly during the recovery period. 9 The APPs have certain advantages in disease monitoring compared to the CBC. The numbers of blood leukocytes are largely affected by extravasation into the pulmonary parenchyma during acute BP, whereas APPs increase consistently with increasing inflammatory stimuli. 9 Minor and moderate positive APPs, such as haptoglobin (Hp), show a more gradual increase and decrease during the acute-phase response (APR). 8 The production of other plasma proteins, socalled negative APPs (such as albumin and transferrin), decreases during the APR. 8 Being nonspecific biomarkers of inflammation, increased serum concentrations of CRP, SAA, and Hp have been observed in dogs with a variety of infectious, immune-mediated and neoplastic diseases. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Despite the nonspecific nature of APPs, serum CRP can be useful in discriminating disease processes such as BP from other pulmonary diseases. 18 The APPs have been shown to decrease after initiation of successful treatment. 16, [19] [20] [21] Additionally, the increase in serum CRP during long-term follow-up in dogs with leishmaniasis and immune-mediated polyarthritis predicts the relapse of clinical disease. 14, 21 The utilization of CRP and SAA as possible prognostic biomarkers also has been studied in dogs, and most studies concluded that serum CRP or SAA concentrations at presentation could not predict clinical outcome. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] However, persistent increases in serum CRP after 48-72 hours of treatment were correlated with poor outcome. [22] [23] [24] Serum CRP has been widely studied in humans with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and its use as a diagnostic and follow-up biomarker is recommended by current treatment guidelines. 27, 28 Bacterial pneumonia currently is treated with markedly longer antimicrobial courses than is CAP, and effective means to estimate optimal treatment duration are lacking. 1, 6, 7, 29 Biomarker-guided antimicrobial treatment has been studied in humans with CAP by procalcitonin (PCT), a novel inflammatory biomarker, which indicated that PCT-guided antibiotic use decreased the duration of antimicrobial treatment without increasing the incidence of complications. [30] [31] [32] Similar studies assessing CRP-guided antimicrobial use in humans with CAP are lacking, but serum CRP has been shown to be useful in decreasing the duration of antimicrobial treatment in humans with neonatal septicemia without increasing the incidence of complications. 33, 34 The aim of our study was to describe the changes in clinical variables, thoracic radiographs, and APPs during a natural course of BP in dogs as well as comparing these variables between dogs with less severe BP requiring <2 days of hospitalization (lsBP) and more severe BP requiring >2 days of hospitalization (msBP). Additionally, the purpose of our study was to provide information concerning the application of APPs in the assessment of treatment response and to investigate whether serum CRP measurements can aid in the estimation of antimicrobial treatment duration in dogs with BP."
ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES From farm management to bacteriophage therapy: strategies to reduce antibiotic use in animal agriculture,"To reduce the use of antibiotics in animal agriculture, a number of effective or commercially viable alternatives have been implemented by food animal producers or are under development. Perhaps the most well-established strategies are flock and herd management practices to mitigate disease introduction and spread, and, subsequently, reduce the need for antibiotic use. While vaccines in food animal production have been used to prevent both bacterial and viral diseases, but historically, most vaccines have targeted viral diseases. Though vaccines against viral diseases can help reduce the need for antibiotic use by controlling the spread of secondary bacterial infections, more recent vaccines under development specifically target bacteria. New developments in selecting and potentially tailoring bacteriophages provide a promising avenue for controlling pathogenic bacteria without the need for traditional small-molecule antibiotics. In this article we discuss these established and emerging strategies, which are anticipated to reduce the reliance on antibiotics in food animal production and should reduce the prevalence and transmission to humans of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from these systems.","There is general agreement among experts that there should be a reduction in the use of medically important antibiotics in animal agriculture. However, even some nonmedically important antibiotics can lead to coselection of genes that confer broadspectrum resistance to drugs, including medically important antibiotics. As such, the overall use of antibiotics in food animals should be limited to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing animal health and welfare."
Regulated Export of a Secretory Protein from the ER of the Hepatocyte: A Specific Binding Site Retaining C-reactive Protein within the ER Is Downregulated during the Acute Phase Response,"253 protein, C-reactive protein (CRPt), varies markedly under differing physiologic conditions (47). CRP, a homopentamer composed of nonglycosylated 24-kD subunits associated by noncovalent forces (24, 29), is a plasma protein whose rate of synthesis by the hepatocyte increases by several hundredfold or more during the systemic acute phase response to tissue injury (39). In studies of the synthesis and secretion of CRP by rabbit primary hepatocyte cultures prepared from animals stimulated in vivo to undergo the acute phase response, the half-time for secretion of newly synthesized CRP was found to decrease markedly from as much as 18 h in control hepatocytes to as little as 75 min in cells from acute phase animals (47), while the kinetics of albumin secretion determined in the same cultures, were rapid (half-time of 30-45 min) and did not vary during the acute phase response. Results of studies in which a fusion gene consisting of the rabbit CRP gene linked to the mouse metallothionein promoter was transfected into HeLa cells (29) indicated that the default rate of rabbit CRP secretion was rapid and suggested that changes in its transit time were due to its specific retention within unstimulated rabbit hepatocytes, rather than to facilitated export in cells from stimulated animals. However, CRP does not contain carboxy-terminal sequences reported to result in ER retention (29). Further, assembly of CRP does not appear to be rate-limiting, since in control as well as stimulated cells >90% of antigenically detectable CRP labeled in a 10-min pulse is pentameric as judged by its size on gel filtration, its differential reactivity with structure-specific antibodies, and its ability to bind phosphocholine (29, 46, 47, and our unpublished observations).","Abstract. The half-time for secretion of the plasma protein C-reactive protein (CRP) by the hepatocyte decreases markedly in association with its increased synthesis during the acute phase response to tissue injury (Macintyre, S., D. Samols, and I. . J. Biol. Chem. 260:4169-4173) . In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent-dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium bind-ing studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (I~ = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response. p ROTEINS that are cotranslationally inserted into the lumen of the ER during their synthesis have varied destinations, including the plasma membrane, the extracellular space, lysosomes, elements of the Golgi apparatus, and the ER itself. Thus, the need for specific delivery of a diversity of proteins to multiple locations represents a formidable task in protein trafficking. The mechanism by which newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are specifically targeted to lysosomes has been well-characterized (reviewed in 37) . Considerable progress has also been made in elucidating the role of the carboxy-terminal KDEL (reviewed in 57), or homologous (2, 3, 26) , sequence in the continuous retrieval of soluble ER resident proteins from downstream compartments to their proper location within the lumen of the ER (42, 57, 74) . More recently, several reports have begun to identify sequence and/or structural motifs of certain transmembrane proteins which allow for their specific localization to the membranes of the ER (32, 54) and Golgi elements (52, 55, 70) ."
Yeast Kexlp Is a Golgi-associated Membrane Protein: Deletions in a Cytoplasmic Targeting Domain Result in Mislocalization to the Vacuolar Membrane,"We have investigated the localization of Kexlp, a type I transmembrane carboxypeptidase involved in precursor processing within the yeast secretory pathway. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of Kexlp in a punctate organelle resembling the yeast Golgi apparatus as identified by Kex2p and Sec7p (Franzusoff, A., K. Redding, J. Crosby, R. S. Fuller, and R. Schekman. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 112:27-37). Glycosylation studies of Kexlp were consistent with a Golgi location, as Kexlp was progressively N-glycosylated in an MNNl-dependent manner.","S ~.CREa'EO biologically active proteins and peptides are classically produced as precursors which undergo both endo-and exoproteolytic processing to release the mature species while traversing the secretory pathway. The KEX/gene product (Kexlp) is a carboxypeptidase, specific for basic amino acid residues, and is responsible for processing proteins secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Dmochowska et al., 1987; Cooper and Bussey, 1989) . In conjunction with the proteases Kex2p and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A (DPAP A) ~ (Stel3p), Kexlp proteolytically matures proteins such as c~-factor and K1 killer toxin from their precursors (for reviews see Bussey, 1988; Fuller et al., 1988) ."
Fibrinous pericarditis secondary to bacterial infection in a cat,"A three-year-old spayed domestic short-haired cat presented for evaluation of weight loss, cardiomegaly and pleural effusion. Echocardiographic examination demonstrated a thickened pericardium with mild pericardial effusion and a large volume of pleural effusion characterized by exudate. Although the cat was treated with antibiotics, the clinical symptoms did not improve. The cat developed dyspnea and died on day 7. Necropsy revealed a large amount of modified transudates ascites, pleural effusion and markedly dilated pericardium. Histopathological examination revealed severe exudation of fibrin and granulation tissue in a thick layer of the epicardium. The cat was diagnosed with fibrinous pericarditis secondary to bacterial infection.","Pericardial disease is not commonly encountered in cats [6] . Previous studies have reported that the overall incidence of pericardial disease in cats ranges from 1 to 2.3% [6, 22] , with congestive heart failure secondary to cardiomyopathy being the most common cause in cats [9] . Other causes of pericardial disease in cats include neoplasia, trauma, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure and infective pericarditis [9, 27, 29] . Infective pericarditis has rarely been reported in cats, and the reported causes of this disease include dental infection, pneumonia, abscess, peritonitis, pyometra or idiopathic [14, 17, 19, 22] . In these cases, the long-term use of appropriate antibiotics could induce clinical remission [14, 19] . However, fibrinous pericarditis, which is well recognized in cattle, has a poor prognosis [4] and has rarely been reported in cats and dogs [20, 23] ."
Implementation of Quaternary Prevention in the Korean Healthcare System: Lessons From the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Outbreak in the Re- public of Korea,"Quaternary prevention should be implemented to minimize harm to patients because the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and promote health. Primary care physicians have a major responsibility in quaternary prevention, and the establishment of clinical epidemiology as a distinct field of study would create a role charged with minimizing patient harm arising from over-medicalization.","Medicine's ultimate aim is to prevent disease and to promote health. The framework of primary-secondary-tertiary prevention that was proposed by Leavell and Clark [1] in the 1940s has been widely used to assign roles to healthcare workers in charge of various strategies to attain this goal (Table 1). In the healthcare service system of the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea), public health workers are in charge of primary prevention, that is, preventing the occurrence of diseases, while primary care physicians are in charge of secondary prevention through the early detection of diseases that have occurred, and medical specialists are responsible for tertiary prevention through appropriate treatment that is designed to prevent mortality and enable the patient to return pISSN 1975 -8375 eISSN 2233 to the community."
"Use of Padlock Probes and Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) for Rapid Identification of Trichophyton Species, Related to Human and Animal Disorder","The high degree of phenotypic similarity among Trichophyton species makes their identification difficult. Objectives: The current study aims to establish the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) based on internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) as a powerful, simple, and rapid procedure for distinguishing closely related organisms, and specifically to identify Trichophyton species, which cause human and animal disorders. Materials and Methods: A total of sixty-one isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were identified to the species level based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations and their ITS rDNA regions were sequenced. Three specific circular oligonucleotide probes targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were designed to differentiate Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsurans. Results: Of the 61 putative Trichophyton clinical isolates, 52 were identified to the species level. The most common species was T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (31 isolates), followed by T. rubrum (11 isolates), T. tonsurans (9 isolates), and T. violaceum (1 isolates); moreover, 9 isolates were identified as non-Trichophyton species. The RCA method correctly identified four Trichophyton species and was 100% specific for each species. Neither cross-reaction between the examined species of Trichophyton nor false positive or false negative results were observed. Conclusions: Species identification of Trichophyton is crucially important for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation. RCA based on ITS polymorphisms can be used to generate identification barcodes and as an alternative to DNA sequencing; it is a very fast, specific, and economical tool for species identification.","Members of the genus Trichophyton are the most common agents of dermatophytosis in humans and other animals, and are associated with a variety of clinical aspects (1) (2) (3) . The most frequent species of dermatophytes are Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, and T. rubrum, and these species cause a multiplicity of cutaneous disorders. They are keratinophilic fungi that attack keratinized tissue and cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that vary from mild to severe, but infections are not life-threatening. Owing to the high degree of phenotypic similarity among species, identification is difficult. Conventional approaches for species-level identification in the diagnostic laboratory are based on morphological and physiological criteria, require several days or weeks to obtain results, and are frequently unspecific. To overcome these problems, molecular techniques have recently been developed to rapidly and precisely identify species of Trichophyton that potentially cause human infection."
Complete List of Authors Promoting Postgraduate year-1 (PGY 1 ) residents' ACGME six core competencies using a structured clinical teachers' training program: one 2-year study,"Objective: Six core competencies designed by Accreditation council for Graduate medical education (ACGME) is essential for establishing a patient center holistic medical system. Postgraduate year-1 (PGY 1 ) residents are main members to take care of patients in the medical system. In order to train PGY 1 resident, we should construct a training program for clinical teacher to help them familiar with ACGME competencies. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of ""training program of ACGME competencies for clinical teacher"". Methods: During 2009 and 2010 years, we trained 134 clinical teachers to teach and train PGY 1 residents about ACGME competencies. Results: The participants of our training program reported that the most teaching skills that they used in teaching were learnt from circuit and itinerant bedside, physical examination (PE) teaching demonstration, lectures and video watching of ""how to teach ACGME Competencies?"". Participants reported that circuit bedside teaching demonstration mainly train the teaching skills of participants for the interpersonal and communication skills (ICS) domain; itinerant teaching demonstration mainly teach the participants the teaching skills of professionalism (P) domain. Both lectures of training camp and video watching for ""how to teach ACGME competencies?"" increase the familiarity of participants to train and teach PGY 1 resident about ACGME competencies. Participants came from internal medicine departments; longer years as the attending physical and having the experience of PGY 1 clinical teachers applied the most teaching skills learnt from training program on their teaching. Conclusions: Our study suggested that ACGME competencies-based ""training program of ACGME competencies for clinical teacher"" were effectively established the training and teaching skills of clinical teachers for PGY 1 residents.","The outbreak of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003 exposed serious deficiencies in Taiwan's health care and medical education systems. 1 The Department of Health (DOH), Executive Yuan therefore focused effort on implementation of the ""Project of Reforming Taiwan's Medical Care and Public"
Zinc Deficiency-Like Syndrome in Fleckvieh Calves: Clinical and Pathological Findings and Differentiation from Bovine Hereditary Zinc Deficiency,"Background: Zinc deficiency-like (ZDL) syndrome is an inherited defect of Fleckvieh calves, with striking similarity to bovine hereditary zinc deficiency (BHZD). However, the causative mutation in a phospholipase D4 encoding gene (PLD4) shows no connection to zinc metabolism.","I n recent years, Bavarian Fleckvieh calves, displaying marked dyskeratotic dermatitis in combination with a history of recurring episodes of respiratory and enteric diseases, attracted attention. These animals showed a striking clinical similarity to calves affected by bovine hereditary zinc deficiency (BHZD), a keratinization disorder caused by a mutation in the SLC39A4 gene. 1, 2 However, a molecular genetic study we conducted on 7 of the affected Fleckvieh calves excluded SLC39A4 as causative gene for the syndrome. 3 Genome-wide resequencing of 1 affected calf identified a nonsense mutation (p.W215X) in a phospholipase D encoding gene (PLD4), located on bovine chromosome 21, as most likely polymorphism. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. A study on the progeny descending from carriers of the mutation showed a significant reduction of the survival rates (P 5 2.97 3 10 28 ). 3 Because of the phenotypic similarity to BHZD the condition was named zinc deficiency-like (ZDL) syndrome."
Inhibition of novel b coronavirus replication by a combination of interferon-a2b and ribavirin,"The identification of a novel b coronavirus, nCoV, as the causative agent of severe respiratory illness in humans originating in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan has raised concerns about the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic similar to that of SARS-CoV. As a definitive treatment regimen has never been thoroughly evaluated for coronavirus infections, there is an urgent need to rapidly identify potential therapeutics to address future cases of nCoV. To determine an intervention strategy, the effect of interferon-a2b and ribavirin on nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells was evaluated. hCoV-EMC/2012 was sensitive to both interferon-a2b and ribavirin alone in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells, but only at relatively high concentrations; however, when combined, lower concentrations of interferon-a2b and ribavirin achieved comparable endpoints. Thus, a combination of interferon-a2b and ribavirin, which are already commonly used in the clinic, may be useful for patient management in the event of future nCoV infections.","A novel b coronavirus (nCoV), has been identified as the etiological agent of 17 confirmed cases (11 deaths) of a severe respiratory illness with occasional renal failure from patients in Saudi Arabia 1 , Qatar 2 , Jordan and the United Kingdom 3, 4 . Complete genome sequencing 1, 5 determined that this new virus is closely related to two Asian bat betacoronaviruses (HKU4 and HKU5) 6 in lineage C. This makes nCoV the first lineage C betacoronavirus known to infect humans 5 . While human-to-human transmission is assumed to be less extensive as compared to SARS-CoV, three of the cases in Saudi Arabia were within one family and several healthcare workers who cared for two of the cases in Jordan have been classified as probable cases 5 . Moreover, in the most recent cluster of cases 7 , two of the three cases did not have a history of travel to the Middle East, but are suspected to have resulted from human-to-human transmission within the UK from a family member with a travel history to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. This would suggest that human-to-human transmission can occur in close contact settings. Presumably, the sporadic nature of the apparently unlinked index cases in three different, albeit geographically proximal countries, and the close relationship to Asian bat coronaviruses, suggests that the source of nCoV is zoonotic 8 ."
Requirement of CRTC1 coactivator for hepatitis B virus transcription,"Transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) template is essential for its replication. Suppressing the level and transcriptional activity of cccDNA might have anti-HBV effect. Although cellular transcription factors, such as CREB, which mediate HBV transcription, have been well described, transcriptional coactivators that facilitate this process are incompletely understood. In this study we showed that CREBregulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) is required for HBV transcription and replication. The steady-state levels of CRTC1 protein were elevated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and liver tissues. Ectopic expression of CRTC1 or its homolog CRTC2 or CRTC3 in hepatoma cells stimulated the activity of the preS2/S promoter of HBV, whereas overexpression of a dominant inactive form of CRTC1 inhibited HBV transcription. CRTC1 interacts with CREB and they are mutually required for the recruitment to the preS2/S promoter on cccDNA and for the activation of HBV transcription. Accumulation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and cccDNA was observed when CRTC1 or its homologs were overexpressed, whereas the levels of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were diminished when CRTC1 was compromised. In addition, HBV transactivator protein HBx stabilized CRTC1 and promoted its activity on HBV transcription. Our work reveals an essential role of CRTC1 coactivator in facilitating and supporting HBV transcription and replication.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member in the family of Hepadnaviridae, has a DNA genome 3.2 kb in size which is partially double stranded. Over 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV worldwide, including ∼10% of the population in Hong Kong and China, 15-40% of whom will terminally develop severe liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1) . Although multiple factors are involved in the development of HCC in HBV carriers, high level of HBV DNA has been identified as a major risk (2) ."
Small synthetic molecule-stabilized RNA pseudoknot as an activator for -1 ribosomal frameshifting,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1PRF) is a recoding mechanism to make alternative proteins from a single mRNA transcript. −1PRF is stimulated by cis-acting signals in mRNA, a seven-nucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream secondary structure element, which is often a pseudoknot. In this study we engineered the frameshifting pseudoknot from the mouse mammary tumor virus to respond to a rationally designed small molecule naphthyridine carbamate tetramer (NCTn). We demonstrate that NCTn can stabilize the pseudoknot structure in mRNA and activate -1PRF both in vitro and in human cells. The results illustrate how NCTninducible -1PRF may serve as an important component of the synthetic biology toolbox for the precise control of gene expression using small synthetic molecules.","The discovery of functional non-coding RNAs has led to a paradigm shift in molecular biology over the past decade, highlighting the important role of RNA in regulation of biological processes, the role that was previously allotted to proteins. It is now apparent that RNA not only carries the genetic information for protein production, but also participates in the regulation of transcription and translation processes (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . These regulatory functions of RNA often depend on its secondary and tertiary structure, which is most clearly illustrated by naturally occurring metabolite sensors, the riboswitches (6) (7) (8) (9) . Riboswitches, which are structured non-coding mRNA elements, bind small-molecule metabolites with high affinity and specificity and regulate the tran-scription or translation of the downstream gene. The discovery of riboswitches has facilitated the development of new strategies for RNA manipulation by small molecules including both natural and synthetic compounds (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Natural riboswitches and in vitro-selected aptamers have been utilized to construct small-molecule responsive RNA devices to control gene expression and cellular phenotypes in bacteria (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) and yeast (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . It would be highly desirable to develop such small molecule-responsive RNA devices for the mammalian system. However so far, there has been only limited success (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) , and thus regulation of gene expression by targeting RNA with synthetic small molecules in a mammalian system is still a challenge for the state-of-the-art synthetic biology."
CASE REPORT Interstitial Pneumonia Associated with the Influenza Vaccine: A Report of Two Cases,"Although the influenza vaccine is relatively safe and effective, serious complications can develop in rare cases. We encountered two cases of interstitial pneumonia that developed after vaccination during the 2014-2015 influenza season. Overall, nine cases, including the two presented here, have been recorded in PubMed and the Cochrane library; eight patients were treated with corticosteroids, and all nine survived, suggesting a good prognosis. Interstitial pneumonia is rare; however, we found an increase in its incidence after 2009. Therefore, clinicians must be aware of the possibility of this complication and duly educate all patients in advance.","Individuals worldwide receive the influenza vaccine because it decreases the incidence of influenza and the risk of more serious influenza-related complications (1, 2) . Although the safety and efficacy of this vaccine is well known, interstitial pneumonia can occasionally occur as a complication. We herein describe two cases of interstitial pneumonia secondary to the 2014-2015 seasonal influenza vaccine, which contained the A(H1N1)pdm09-like antigen, and present a review of similar reported cases."
Respiratory Tract Infections Due to Human Metapneumovirus in Immunocompromised Children,"Background. The clinical presentation and management of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections in immunocompromised children is not well understood. Methods. We performed a retrospective evaluation of pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections and underlying hematologic malignancy, solid tumors, solid organ transplant, rheumatologic disease, and/or receipt of chronic immunosuppressants. Data were analyzed using t tests and Fisher's exact tests. Results. Overall, 55 patients (median age: 5 years; range: 5 months-19 years) with hMPV infection documented between 2006 and 2010 were identified, including 24 (44%) with hematologic malignancy, 9 (16%) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 9 (16%) with solid tumors, and 8 (15%) with solid organ transplants. Three (5%) presented with fever alone, 35 (64%) presented with upper respiratory tract infections, and 16 (29%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Twelve (23%) patients required intensive care unit admission and/or supplemental oxygen 28% FiO 2 . Those with severe disease were more likely to be neutropenic (P = .02), but otherwise did not differ by age (P = .27), hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient status (P = .19), or presence of lymphopenia (P = .09). Nine (16%) patients received treatment with ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or both. Three children (5%) died of hMPV pneumonia. Conclusions. Immunocompromised pediatric patients with hMPV infection have high rates of LRTI and mortality. The benefits of treatment with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin in this patient population require further evaluation.","Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus first identified in 2001 as a pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [1] . Seroprevalence studies show that almost all children acquire infection by 5 years of age, and that frequent reinfections occur through life [2, 3] . The prevalence of hMPV infection among hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection or fever is similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Clinical disease most closely resembles that associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), a related paramyxovirus [4] . A prospective cohort study of hMPV revealed a 9.4% seroprevalence in children hospitalized with respiratory tract infections, with 63% of patients requiring supplemental oxygen and 3% requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission [5] . Lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTI) caused by hMPV includes bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup. hMPV is also associated with acute otitis media, as well as more rarely conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and rash [6, 7] . In adults with hematologic malignancy, hMPV is associated with high rates of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract disease and substantial mortality [8, 9] ."
Delivery of steric block morpholino oligomers by (R-X-R) 4 peptides: structure-activity studies,"Redirecting the splicing machinery through the hybridization of high affinity, RNase H-incompetent oligonucleotide analogs such as phosphoramidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO) might lead to important clinical applications. Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R) 4 (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequencespecific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R) 4 -PMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. Structureactivity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs.","Protein transduction domains as penetratin or Tat 48-60 and synthetic cell penetrating peptides (CPP) as oligoarginine have generated a large interest for their seemingly unique mechanism of membrane translocation and for their capacity to transport various biomolecules across biological membranes (1) . Both assumptions have had to be re-visited since cellular uptake does involve endocytosis (2) and transport of biomolecules does not occur as efficiently as anticipated at least at low concentrations. In a series of experiments carried out independently by several groups, CPPs mentioned above turned out inefficient in transporting uncharged splice correcting oligonucleotide (ON) analogs as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) for a large part because CPP-conjugated material remained entrapped in endocytic vesicles (3) . Accordingly, peptides or drugs (such as chloroquine) leading to endosome destabilization did significantly increase splicing correction."
Epidemiological and clinical profile of Korean travelers receiving international medical repatriation,The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of medical transportation of Korean travelers who suffered accidents abroad and then transferred home by our aeromedical team.,"As a result of socioeconomic development and growing interest in travel, the number of South Koreans traveling abroad has increased markedly over the past 10 years. Between 2008 and 2018 the number of international travelling tripled from 9.5 million to 29 million in Korea, [1] and this upward trend is expected to be continued. With this increase in international travel, more people are thus exposed to a variety of health risks such as injuries and infectious diseases while traveling abroad. For example, the 2015 Korea outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, which resulted in 186 cases including 38 fatalities was initiated from a returning traveler from the Middle East. [2, 3] Generally, travel is associated with unfamiliar environments such as sudden changes in temperature, traffic rules, food culture, and exposure to a variety of infectious diseases that can result in hospitalization abroad. Nevertheless, many people often travel without travel insurance that protects them, including financially, in case of medical emergencies overseas, [4] [5] [6] assuming ""it will not happen to me"". Hospitalization abroad may involve considerable medical costs accrued within a short time, and communication may also be a problem. Most patients wish to return home quickly, but it can be delayed due to poor transportation systems and/or lack of specialized escort teams. [7] Despite increasing number of Korean travelers hospitalized abroad and transferred home by aeromedical team, there have been no studies investigating the medical transportation of Korean travelers from foreign countries. In this study, we analyzed the transportation experiences of Korean travelers who suffered accidents abroad and were then transferred home by our aeromedical team."
"The Membrane Protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Functions as a Novel Cytosolic Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern To Promote Beta Interferon Induction via a Toll- Like-Receptor-Related TRAF3-Independent Mechanism The driving force for M-mediated IFN-␤ production is most likely generated from inside the cells. M-mediated IFN-␤ induction was confirmed at the viral infection level since a point mutation at the V68 residue of M markedly inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirally induced IFN-␤ production. Thus, the results in- dicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate IFN-␤ production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade","Most of the intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) reside in either the endolysosome or the cytoplasm to sense pathogen-derived RNAs, DNAs, or synthetic analogs of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), such as poly(I:C). However, it remains elusive whether or not a pathogen-derived protein can function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this study, we demonstrate that delivering the membrane gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into HEK293T, HEK293ET, and immobilized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage (J2-M) cells significantly upregulates beta interferon (IFN-␤) production. Both NF-B and TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascades are activated by M gene products. M protein rather than M mRNA is responsible for M-mediated IFN-␤ induction that is preferentially associated with the activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not the RIG-I signaling cascade.","In addition to the TLR, which can be defined as a membraneassociated PRR, another set of PRRs is localized at the cytoplasm and mainly includes RIG-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) to sense viral dsRNAs and bacterial cell wall components, respectively (2, 7) . The RLRs consist of at least three members, including RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I recognizes 5=-triphosphate RNA and short dsRNA (4, 8) , while MDA5 senses long dsRNA (9) . An adaptor protein, MAVS, is required for the activation of the RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway. The association of viral nucleic acids with MAVS promotes the aggregation of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane (10) . The ""ligation"" of TRAF3 with the aggregated MAVS may promote the phosphorylation of IRF3 that is required for IFN-␤ production (11) . A recent study also shows that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived adaptor protein, STING, could also function downstream of MAVS to promote IRF3 phosphorylation and the subsequent IFN-␤ response (12) ."
A Novel Construction of Genome Space with Biological Geometry,"A genome space is a moduli space of genomes. In this space, each point corresponds to a genome. The natural distance between two points in the genome space reflects the biological distance between these two genomes. Currently, there is no method to represent genomes by a point in a space without losing biological information. Here, we propose a new graphical representation for DNA sequences. The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method and prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. Using these moment vectors, we have constructed a novel genome space as a subspace in R N . It allows us to show that the SARS-CoV is most closely related to a coronavirus from the palm civet not from a bird as initially suspected, and the newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 is more closely related to SARS than to any other known member of group 2 coronavirus. Furthermore, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree for 34 lentiviruses (including human immunodeficiency virus) based on their whole genome sequences. Our genome space will provide a new powerful tool for analyzing the classification of genomes and their phylogenetic relationships.","Comparative genomics at the sequence level has existed for 20 years, since the time genome sequencing started in earnest. Already there have been many proposals to compare genomes. Boore and Brown 1 used gene order to study the evolutionary relationships of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Snel et al. 2 later constructed the phylogenetic tree for completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes based on gene content. In Snel et al.'s method, the similarity between two genomes is defined as the number of genes that they have in common divided by their total number of genes. However, such techniques are time-consuming as they must first identify all the genes in one genome. These approaches, together with G þ C content, edit distance, and reversal and rearrangement distances, 3 -5 compare genomes using only partial genomic information. Thus, these results are usually controversial because single-gene sequences generally do not contain enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms."
The Use of Ebola Convalescent Plasma to Treat Ebola Virus Disease in Resource-Constrained Settings: A Perspective From the Field,"The clinical evaluation of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the current outbreak, predominantly affecting Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, was prioritized by the World Health Organization in September 2014. In each of these countries, nonrandomized comparative clinical trials were initiated. The Ebola-Tx trial in Conakry, Guinea, enrolled 102 patients by 7 July 2015; no severe adverse reactions were noted. The Ebola-CP trial in Sierra Leone and the EVD001 trial in Liberia have included few patients. Although no efficacy data are available yet, current field experience supports the safety, acceptability, and feasibility of CP as EVD treatment. Longer-term follow-up as well as data from nontrial settings and evidence on the scalability of the intervention are required. CP sourced from within the outbreak is the most readily available source of anti-EVD antibodies. Until the advent of effective antivirals or monoclonal antibodies, CP merits further evaluation.","Convalescent blood or plasma transfusion has been used in clinical settings for >100 years [1] . Until the advent of antibiotic therapy, it was widely used for a range of bacterial and viral diseases. A recent meta-analysis suggests that it could have contributed to an absolute reduction in mortality of around 20% during the 1918 influenza epidemic [2] . At present, hyperimmune globulin, manufactured from convalescent donors' plasma, is still employed as prophylaxis or treatment for certain infectious diseases (eg, measles, diphtheria, polio, hepatitis A and B) [3] . Passive antibody therapy is not a new intervention but a widely tested, safe, and proven prophylactic and therapeutic intervention."

Successful Rechallenge with Imatinib in a Patient with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Who Previously Experienced Imatinib Mesylate Induced Pneumonitis,"Imatinib mesylate is a targeted therapy that acts by inhibiting tyrosine kinase of the bcr-abl fusion oncoprotein, which is specific to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and the c-transmembrane receptor, which is specific to gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare adverse event of imatinib therapy. It is clinically difficult to distinguish from infectious pneumonia, which can frequently occur due to the underlying disease. The standard treatment for imatinib-induced pneumonitis is to discontinue the medication and optionally administer corticosteroids. However, there are a few cases of successful retrial with imatinib. We describe a case of successful rechallenge of imatinib in a patient with imatinib-induced interstitial pneumonitis and CML without a recurrence of the underlying disease after 3 months of follow-up.",Imatinib is a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts on the bcr-abl gene of the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

NOTE Immunohistochemical studies on meningoencephalitis in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP),"The present study describes the association between inflammatory cell types and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) antigen in the brain of 4 cats diagnosed as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Immunohistochemically, FIPV antigens were detected in the inflammatory foci of the leptomeninges, choroid plexus and ventricles in 3 of the 4 cats. In 3 cases, inflammatory foci mainly consisted of CD204-and Iba1-positive macrophages, and the FIPV antigens were found in the macrophages. In the other case which was negative for FIPV antigen, severe inflammation predominantly consisting of CD20-positive B lymphocytes was observed in the leptomeninges and subventricles, accompanied with diffuse proliferation of gemistocytic astrocytes. The difference in histopathology may reflect the inflammatory process or the strain variation of FIP virus.","FIP). For case Nos. 3 and 4, the antibody titer of FCoV was elevated (FIP: >100)."
Imatinib-induced irreversible interstitial lung disease A case report,"Rationale: Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a classic tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Although it is well tolerated by most patients and helps in the achievement of complete remission, a few rare imatinib-associated adverse effects such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis have been reported. Because of its rareity, the clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain unclear.","Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome and abnormal cloning of hematopoietic cells. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib, STI571) is the first approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for the frontline treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML. Commonly reported side effects of all clinically used TKIs include lung injury and repair, loss of stem cells from epithelial surfaces, and drug-associated cell injury. However, these adverse reactions depend on individual susceptibility. Imatinib is generally tolerated well by most patients, although its use at high doses can cause grade 3 and 4 nonhematological toxicities and severe pulmonary adverse events in the early chronic phase of CML. [1] Imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare occurrence with unclear clinical features. Here we report a rare case involving a 49-year-old man with CML who developed acute and irreversible interstitial pneumonitis after 9 months of treatment with imatinib."
Current Status of Infection Prevention and Control Programs for Emergency Medical Personnel in the Republic of Korea,"Objectives: Emergency medical personnel (EMPs) are pre-hospital emergency responders who are at risk of exposure to infections and may also serve as a source for the transmission of infections. However, few studies of infection control have specifically addressed EMPs in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea). The goal of this study was to assess the current status of infection prevention and control programs (IPCPs) for EMPs in Korea.","During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) from May to July 2015, two emergency medical personnel were infected with MERS, among a total of 39 healthcare workers who developed MERS occupationally [1] ."
SEARCH STRATEGY PubMed databases were searched for studies on MERS cases during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea. The search terms used were combinations of 'Middle East respiratory syndrome' in all fields and 'Korea' in all,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia in 2012. The 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV involved 186 cases, including 38 fatalities. A total of 83% of transmission events were due to five superspreaders, and 44% of the 186 MERS cases were the patients who had been exposed in nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals. The epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government quarantined 16,993 individuals for 14 days to control the outbreak. This outbreak provides a unique opportunity to fill the gap in our knowledge of MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in this paper, we review the literature on epidemiology, virology, clinical features, and prevention of MERS-CoV, which were acquired from the 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia in September 2012 [1] . Since then, as of 31 January 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 2,143 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 750 deaths, from 27 countries (Fig. 1) [2] . Most of MERS-CoV human infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia reported 1,783 cases, including 726 deaths (fatality rate, 40.7%) [3] . A recent article summarized the current knowledge on the epidemiology, virology, human pathogenesis, clinical management, and prevention of MERS-CoV infection [4] . Another comprehensive review article on risk factors and determinants of transmission of MERS-CoV from human to human in the community and hospital settings has been published recently [5] . Public Health England also published an extensive review of literature for clinical decision-making support for treatment of MERS-CoV patients [6] ."
SCIENCE BENTHAM,"Aspirin is the oldest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and it sometimes causes asthma-like symptoms known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which can be serious. Unwanted effects of aspirin (aspirin intolerance) are also observed in patients with food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, a type I allergy disease, and aspirin-induced urticaria (AIU). However the target and the mechanism of the aspirin intolerance are still unknown. There is no animal or cellular model of AERD, because its pathophysiological mechanism is still unknown, but it is thought that inhibition of cyclooxygenase by causative agents leads to an increase of free arachidonic acid, which is metabolized into cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) that provoke airway smooth muscle constriction and asthma symptoms. As the bed-tobench approach, to confirm the clinical discussion in experimental cellular models, we have tried to develop a cellular model of AERD using activated RBL-2H3 cells, a rat mast cell like cell line. Indomethacin (another NSAID and also causes AERD), enhances in vitro cysLTs production by RBL-2H3 cells, while there is no induction of cysLTs production in the absence of inflammatory activation. Since this suggests that all inflammatory cells with activation of prostaglandin and cysLT metabolism should respond to NSAIDs, and then I have concluded that aspirin intolerance should be separated from subsequent bronchoconstriction. Evidence about the cellular mechanisms of NSAIDs may be employed for development of in vitro AERD models as the approach from bench-to-bed.","According to the asthma guideline of the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 21% of adult asthma patients and 5% of pediatric asthma patients have AERD [8] , while the Japanese asthma guideline [9] states that 5-10% of adult asthma patients and 3.6-7.8% of pediatric asthma patients have AERD. According to both guidelines, the majority of AERD patients are adults."
Impact of a Hypothetical Infectious Disease Outbreak on US Exports and Export-Based Jobs,"We estimated the impact on the US export economy of an illustrative infectious disease outbreak scenario in Southeast Asia that has 3 stages starting in 1 country and, if uncontained, spreads to 9 countries. We used 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic-related World Bank estimates of 3.3% and 16.1% reductions in gross domestic product (GDP). We also used US Department of Commerce job data to calculate export-related jobs at risk to any outbreak-related disruption in US exports. Assuming a direct correlation between GDP reductions and reduced demand for US exports, we estimated that the illustrative outbreak would cost from approximately $13 million to approximately $64 million (1 country) to $8 billion to $41 billion (9 countries) and place 1,500 to almost 1.4 million export-related US jobs at risk. Our analysis illustrates how global health security is enhanced, and the US economy is protected, when public health threats are rapidly detected and contained at their source.","We cannot consider West Africa's Ebola epidemic an unlikely-to-be-repeated event. The risk of pandemic events is a constant, if not increasing, threat. 1 Illustrating the economic risks associated with pandemics, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future determined that a conservatively low estimate of the annual economic costs of a global pandemic comparable to that of the 20th century influenza pandemics (ie, 1918 1 Such reductions in economic activity are likely to reduce the demand for imported goods and services in the affected countries. Thus, the economic problems triggered by a large-scale outbreak in 1 country can have adverse impacts on the export economies of other countries. 1 In 2015, the estimated value of all US exports was approximately $2.2 trillion, representing 13% of US gross domestic product (GDP). These exports supported approximately 11.5 million US jobs, or 8% of all US employment. [4] [5] [6] Consequently, even if an outbreak of an infectious disease does not reach the United States, an outbreak in a foreign country or region could cause a disruption in the US export economy worth several hundred million dollars and jeopardize tens of thousands of US export-related jobs."
"Veterinary Science pISSN 1229-845X, eISSN 1976-555X","To obtain a more sensitive and convenient diagnosis of the disease, we prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for the FeLV p27 to develop a rapid diagnostic test with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Among these antibodies, we identified two clones (hybridomas 8F8B5 and 8G7D1) that specifically bound to FeLV and were very suitable for a diagnostic kit. The affinity constants for 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 were 0.35 × 10 9 and 0.86 × 10 9 , respectively. To investigate the diagnostic abilities of the rapid kit using these antibodies, we performed several clinical studies. Assessment of analytical sensitivity revealed that the detection threshold of the rapid diagnostic test was 2 ng/mL for recombinant p27 and 12.5 × 10 4 IU/mL for FeLV. When evaluating 252 cat sera samples, the kit was found to have a kappa value of 0.88 compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating a significant correlation between data from the rapid diagnostic test and PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of the kit were 95.2% (20/21) and 98.5% (257/261), respectively. Our results demonstrated that the rapid diagnostic test would be a suitable diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of FeLV infection in cats.","Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is one of the most important infectious pathogens that causes death in cats and is broadly spread worldwide [12, 17, 24] . FeLV was discovered among cats that lived in a cluster-household where several animals had developed lymphosarcoma [19] . The virus is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA retrovirus. Cats are usually infected by direct contact with infected cats [12, 31, 33] , mostly via oronasal exposure to saliva and nasal secretions containing high levels of the virus especially through mutual grooming and sharing food dishes or water bowls [11, 12, 17] . Vertical transmission occasionally occurs [35] but is of secondary importance. FeLV-associated diseases include a variety of neoplastic disorders, anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, neurological disorders, reproductive failure in female cats, and numerous secondary infections caused by FeLV-induced immunosuppression [12, 34] . Although the period of disease progression is highly variable, 83% of FeLV-infected cats die within 3 years [29] . Given these findings, the accurate diagnosis of FeLV infection is very important to break the cycle of horizontal and vertical transmission in feline populations. Several diagnostic tools have been introduced in veterinary clinics: the passive hemagglutination test [37] , complement fixation test [36] , immunofluorescent assay [13] , enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [25] [26] [27] [28] , saliva test [10] , and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) [7] . The RDT, also 92 Won-Shik Kim et al. known as the lateral flow rapid test, has several advantages such as quick turnaround, cost-effectiveness, and usability in locations far removed from laboratories. Consequently, the RDT has been widely used in clinics and elsewhere [30, 39] . In this report, we describe the preparation of monoclonal antibodies specific for the p27 of FeLV. We also provide details about the development of an RDT system using these antibodies and clinical characteristics of the assay. "
Suppression of Drug Resistance in Dengue Virus,"Dengue virus is a major human pathogen responsible for 400 million infections yearly. As with other RNA viruses, daunting challenges to antiviral design exist due to the high error rates of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Indeed, treatment of dengue virus infection with a nucleoside analog resulted in the expected genetic selection of resistant viruses in tissue culture and in mice. However, when the function of the oligomeric core protein was inhibited, no detectable selection of drug resistance in tissue culture or in mice was detected, despite the presence of drug-resistant variants in the population. Suppressed selection of drug-resistant virus correlated with cooligomerization of the targeted drug-susceptible and drug-resistant core proteins. The concept of ""dominant drug targets,"" in which inhibition of oligomeric viral assemblages leads to the formation of drugsusceptible chimeras, can therefore be used to prevent the outgrowth of drug resistance during dengue virus infection. IMPORTANCE Drug resistance is a major hurdle in the development of effective antivirals, especially those directed at RNA viruses. We have found that one can use the concept of the genetic dominance of defective subunits to ""turn cousins into enemies,"" i.e., to thwart the outgrowth of drug-resistant viral genomes as soon as they are generated. This requires deliberate targeting of larger assemblages, which would otherwise rarely be considered by antiviral researchers.","F or the positive-strand RNA viruses that are considered priority pathogens (dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Chikungunya virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, hepatitis A virus and the causative agents of several viral encephalopathies), no antiviral pharmaceuticals exist. Among negative-strand RNA viruses, the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the threat of new influenza virus pandemics further highlight the importance of developing effective vaccines and therapeutics that target any of these highly adaptable, genetically labile RNA viruses (1) . Dengue virus, originally confined to tropical and subtropical areas, has begun to spread outside its former geographic limitations due to the changing ecology of mosquito populations in the face of urbanization and global warming. Previously dengue-free countries are now at risk: Japan, with no reported cases of dengue fever in 70 years, suffered a disease outbreak in 2014 (2) . Due to the expanded range of each of the four dengue virus serotypes, it is now more likely for individuals who have been infected previously with one serotype to become infected with another. Antibodies from the first infection that do not neutralize the newly infecting serotype can enhance its symptoms, increasing the probability of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe and often fatal form of the disease (3) . Given the demographics of infection by dengue virus and other emerging pathogens, it is highly desirable to reduce the complexity and expense of vaccines and treatments."
Pathogenesis of oral type I feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection: Antibody- dependent enhancement infection of cats with type I FIPV via the oral route,"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes a severe, immune-mediated disease called FIP in domestic and wild cats. It is unclear whether FIP transmits from cat to cat through the oral route of FIPV infection, and the reason for this includes that FIP is caused by oral inoculation with some FIPV strains (e.g., type II FIPV WSU 79-1146), but is not caused by other FIPV (e.g., type I FIPV KU-2 strain: FIPV-I KU-2). In this study, when cats passively immunized with anti-FIPV-I KU-2 antibodies were orally inoculated with FIPV-I KU-2, FIP was caused at a 50% probability, i.e., FIPV not causing FIP through oral infection caused FIP by inducing antibody-dependent enhancement. Many strains of type I FIPV do not cause FIP by inoculation through the oral route in cats. Based on the findings of this study, type I FIPV which orally infected cats may cause FIP depending on the condition.","Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae [7] . FCoV is classified into two serotypes (I and II), based on differences in the amino acid (aa) sequence of Spike (S) protein and antibody neutralization. Furthermore, FCoV exists as two different biotypes: Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV: avirulent FCoV) and Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV: virulent FCoV) [21] . Antibodies against virus enhance viral load and disease severity in some viral infections including FIP. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection [14] . ADE of FIPV infection can be induced by the presence of sub-neutralizing levels of anti-FIPV S antibodies [6] . Unlike dengue virus infection, ADE was induced by re-infection with the identical serotype virus in FIPV infection [17] ."
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Superspreading Event Involving 81 Persons, Korea 2015","Since the first imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was reported on May 20, 2015 in Korea, there have been 186 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with 36 fatalities.

Viral Respiratory Tract Infection During the First Postoperative Year Is a Risk Factor for Chronic Rejection After Lung Transplantation,"Background. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the major limiting factor for long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. Method. Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. Results. Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. Conclusions. This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with longterm CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.","Background.

The yearly number of procedures has increased, but long-term survival has not improved markedly over the years. 1 The main limiting factor for long-term survival is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), commonly in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). 1 In recent years, restrictive allograft syndrome has also gained recognition. 2 The underlying pathophysiology of CLAD development is multifactorial and infections are a major risk factor. 3 Other risk factors include acute rejection (AR), antibody-mediated rejection, gastroesophageal reflux, and air pollution exposure. 4 The importance of viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) for CLAD development and graft loss has been highlighted. [5] [6] [7] [8] However, a meta-analysis of 34 articles was unable to establish an association between VRTI and CLAD or graft loss, 9 possibly due to differences in diagnostic methods between the included studies. More recently, the development of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods has promoted a more sensitive and a standardized detection of respiratory viral agents. 10 We previously showed an association between detection of viral pathogens in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples taken during the first year after LTx and the development of BOS. 11 Others have recently reported an increased risk of CLAD after VRTI, 12, 13 but the long-term effects of early VRTI as well as the importance of VRTI compared with other risk factors remain unclear."
Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis,"Introduction: The aim of the study was to demonstrate interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions. Material and methods: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. Interleukin-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of 2 months of treatment. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. Results: Of all 16 studied patients, significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001). Conclusions: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.","Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition which is the result of persistent stimulation of T cells by antigens of epidermal origin [1] . This persistent stimulation of T cells is the result of interaction between T cells, antigen-presenting cells, i.e. Langerhans cells, and antigens, and comprises the following steps: primary signals (signal 1) including T-cell receptor stimulation by peptide antigen, costimulation (so-called accessory signals) (signal 2) and T helper type 1 (Th1) differentiation and proliferation [2] ."
Protein Domain Boundary Predictions: A Structural Biology Perspective,"One of the important fields to apply computational tools for domain boundaries prediction is structural biology. They can be used to design protein constructs that must be expressed in a stable and functional form and must produce diffraction-quality crystals. However, prediction of protein domain boundaries on the basis of amino acid sequences is still very problematical. In present study the performance of several computational approaches are compared. It is observed that the statistical significance of most of the predictions is rather poor. Nevertheless, when the right number of domains is correctly predicted, domain boundaries are predicted within very few residues from their real location. It can be concluded that prediction methods cannot be used yet as routine tools in structural biology, though some of them are rather promising.","Computational/mathematical approaches, such as structural bioinformatics [1] , structural class prediction [2, 3] , molecular docking [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , molecular packing [10, 11] , pharmacophore modelling [12] , Mote Carlo simulated annealing approach [13] , diffusion-controlled reaction simulation [14] , graph/diagram approach [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , bio-macromolecular internal collective motion simulation [22] , QSAR [23] [24] [25] , protein subcellular location prediction [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , protein structural class prediction [31, 32] , identification of membrane proteins and their types [33] , identification of enzymes and their functional classes [34] , identification of proteases and their types [35] , protein cleavage site prediction [36] [37] [38] , and signal peptide prediction [39, 40] can timely provide very useful information and insights for both basic research and drug design and hence are widely welcome by science community."
PGHN The Relationships between Respiratory Virus Infection and Aminotransferase in Children,"We sought to examine the relationship between the clinical manifestations of nonspecific reactive hepatitis and respiratory virus infection in pediatric patients. Methods: Patients admitted to the pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital for lower respiratory tract disease between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 and who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests were examined. The patients were divided into those with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and those with normal ALT or AST levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with patients in the normal group, and the blood test results were compared according to the type of respiratory virus. Results: Patients with increased ALT or AST levels had one more day of hospital stay, on average, compared with patients in the normal group (5.3±3.1 days vs. 4.4±3.0 days, p=0.019). Patients in the increased ALT level group were younger and had a longer mean hospital stay, compared with patients in the normal group (p=0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The incidences of increased ALT or AST were the highest in adenovirus infections (6/24, 25.0%), followed by enterovirus (2/11, 18.2%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (21/131, 16.0%) infections. Conclusion: Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is more common among patients with adenovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection, as well as among those infected at a younger age. Compared with AST levels, ALT levels are better indicators of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.","Aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase are the common indicators used for assess-ing the state (or condition) of the liver. In particular, increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicate acute hepatocellular injury, such as viral in-Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr fection, toxic injury, hypoxia, and hypoperfusion, where ALT and AST levels can rise by thousands of times the levels in the normal range. While ALT is relatively liver specific, AST levels can increase because of damage to other organs [1] . In addition, there are cases where non-hepatic respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections lead to increased levels of ALT and AST without hepatic failure, and such conditions are referred to as nonspecific reactive hepatitis [2, 3] ."
"Travel, migration and emerging infectious diseases","Emerging infectious diseases (EID) threaten public health and are sustained by increasing global commerce, travel and disruption of ecological systems. Travelers could play a role in importing EIDs and could be a sentinel of major epidemics. In connection with the extension of poverty, urbanization, extensive livestock rearing and globalization, we could be exposed to a third epidemiological transition characterized by zoonotic diseases and infections with multidrugresistant bacteria. The risk appears low for emerging infectious diseases, or very low for high-risk emerging infectious diseases, but higher for multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae carriage with possibly limited consequences. The role played by migrants is weaker than imagined. Immigrants don't play the role of sentinel epidemic so far. They could play a role in importing multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae, but it is poorly evaluated.","Emerging infectious diseases (EID) threaten public health and are sustained by increasing global commerce, travel and disruption of ecological systems.

Viral Infections and Associated Factors That Promote Acute Exacerbations of Asthma Viral Infection and Asthma Exacerbation Viral Infection and Asthma Exacerbation Viral Infection and Asthma Exacerbation,"This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","In the past few decades, highly sensitive and specific tests for virus detection have been developed, resulting in accurate detection of a long list of viruses associated with wheezing in early life, the risk for developing asthma, and exacerbation of established disease. Human rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) top the list, but recently discovered or re-emerging viruses (e.g., human metapneumovirus [HMPV] coronaviruses and enterovirus [EV]-D68) also contribute to acute wheezing in infancy and virus-mediated exacerbations. However, most viral infections are not associated with acute exacerations, and cofactors, including allergic inflammation and airway bacteria, have been described that increase the severity of infection and the probability of exacerbation. 1,2 Detection of both viruses and airway bacteria are associated with acute wheezing illnesses; specifically, co-infections of respiratory viruses and Moraxella catarrhalis, Hemophilus influenza, and/or Streptococcus pneumonia increases the risk for more severe respiratory illnesses and exacerbations of asthma. 3 The addition of antibiotics to treatment regimens for asthma exacerbation could materialize in the near future."

Key stakeholder perspectives were sought of the managerial processes associated with perceived success and lessons for future outbreaks.,"This work can serve as a tool to guide organizational actions in the control of rare infectious outbreaks in an advanced health care setting. Although this research was conducted by independent researchers, it has included a selected group of participants, whose perspectives may or may not differ from the broader population. Moreover, staff perspectives may have been influenced by the time duration since the outbreak was curtailed. Finally, decision-makers, who are very well informed about the outbreak management, have shared in the interviews, and we cannot rule out a possible conflict of interest. Effort was made to eliminate these limitations through strong methodological rigors. The lessons learned from this work can be summarized as:"
The fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) tool: development and general psychometric properties †,"background: To develop the first international instrument to measure fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) in men and women experiencing fertility problems, to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of this new tool and to translate FertiQoL into multiple languages. method: We conducted a survey, both online and in fertility clinics in USA, Australia/New Zealand, Canada and UK. A total of 1414 people with fertility problems participated. The main outcome measure was the FertiQoL tool.","'Quality of life' (QoL) was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an ' . . . individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns . . . ' (WHOQOL, 1995) . The WHOQOL measures QoL broadly according to 29 facets (e.g. self-esteem, mobility and safety). QoL measurement is important to identify aspects of fertility problems associated with poor QoL and advance research in health service-evaluation, patient satisfaction and policy-making through the use of a standard measurement tool (Saxena et al., 2001) ."
Molecular Epidemiology of Paramyxoviruses in Frugivorous Eidolon helvum Bats in Zambia,"In this study, we describe the detection of novel paramyxoviruses from the Eidolon helvum species of fruit bats. We extracted RNA from 312 spleen samples from bats captured in Zambia over a period of 4 years (2008)(2009)(2010)(2011). Semi-nested RT-PCR detected a total of 25 (8%) positive samples for paramyxoviruses which were then directly sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic analysis. Among the positive samples, seven novel paramyxoviruses were detected. Five viruses were closely related to the genus Henipavirus, while two viruses were related to the unclassified Bat paramyxoviruses from Ghana and Congo Brazzaville. Our study identified novel Henipavirus-related and unrelated viruses using RT-PCR in fruit bats from Kansaka National Park and indicated the presence of similar Bat paramyxoviruses originating from wide geographic areas, suggesting the ability of bats to harbor and transmit viruses. The presence of these viruses in fruit bats might pose a public health risk.","In the past 10 years, a lot of attention has been given to bats as reservoirs of emerging zoonotic viruses. This has been as a result of the high detection rate of previously unknown viral sequences in bats coupled with the emergence of pathogens, such as Hendra, Nipah, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Corona, Ebola and Marburg viruses, all of which are highly virulent and pose a great zoonotic risk [2, 3, 8, 9, 17] . Bats, being the only flying mammals with ancient evolutionary origins and long life span, are capable of covering great distances during migrations, rendering them suitable hosts and reservoirs for various viruses. Paramyxoviruses from the family Paramyxoviridae have been implicated in several human epidemics and mortalities [6, 10, 19] . Several studies have indicated bats as potential natural reservoirs of Paramyxoviruses, such as Henipavirus-, Respirovirus-and Morbillivirus-related viruses [1, 4] . This undoubtedly presents a threat to the health of the hu-man population in areas where human beings live in close proximity to fruit bat species [7] . In Zambia, straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) annually converge in Kasanka National Park (KNP)."
NS5A Domain 1 and Polyprotein Cleavage Kinetics Are Critical for Induction of Double-Membrane Vesicles Associated with Hepatitis C Virus Replication,"Induction of membrane rearrangements in the cytoplasm of infected cells is a hallmark of positive-strand RNA viruses. These altered membranes serve as scaffolds for the assembly of viral replication factories (RFs). We have recently shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) representing the major constituent of the RF within the infected cell. RF formation requires the concerted action of nonstructural action of nonstructural protein (NS)3, -4A, protein (NS)3 -4A, -4B, -5A, and -5B. Although the sole expression of NS5A is sufficient to induce DMV formation, its efficiency is very low. In this study, we dissected the determinants within NS5A responsible for DMV formation and found that RNA-binding domain 1 (D1) and the amino-terminal membrane anchor are indispensable for this process. In contrast, deletion of NS5A D2 or D3 did not affect DMV formation but disrupted RNA replication and virus assembly, respectively. To identify cis-and trans-acting factors of DMV formation, we established a trans cleavage assay. We found that induction of DMVs requires full-length NS3, whereas a helicase-lacking mutant was unable to trigger DMV formation in spite of efficient polyprotein cleavage. Importantly, a mutation accelerating cleavage kinetics at the NS4B-5A site diminished DMV formation, while the insertion of an internal ribosome entry site mimicking constitutive cleavage at this boundary completely abolished this process. These results identify key determinants governing the biogenesis of the HCV RF with possible implications for our understanding of how RFs are formed in other positive-strand RNA viruses.","velope protein 1 (E1) and E2 that build up the virus particle. The viroporin p7 and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) are accessory factors required for the assembly of infectious HCV particles (reviewed in reference 10). The minimal HCV replicase comprises the remaining nonstructural proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (11) . NS3 is composed of two domains comprising an N-terminal serine protease that is activated by interaction with NS4A and responsible for proteolytic maturation of the replicase proteins and an NTPase/RNA helicase domain formed by the C-terminal two-thirds of NS3 (reviewed in reference 12). Highly hydrophobic NS4B is believed to build the scaffold of the viral replication complex and forms oligomeric complexes that are important for the formation of DMVs (13) (14) (15) (16) . NS5A is an RNAbinding phosphoprotein containing an N-terminal amphipathic ␣-helix (AH) that stably tethers the protein to intracellular membranes (17, 18) (reviewed in reference 19) . NS5A is composed of three domains (D1 to D3) that are separated by low-complexity sequence I (LCSI) and LCSII. D1 is the main determinant of RNA replication, whereas D3 plays a major role in the assembly of infectious virus particles, probably by interacting with the core protein (20) (21) (22) (23) . In fact, major parts of D3 can be deleted without affecting RNA replication and D3 tolerates in-frame insertion of heterologous proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) (24) . The exact role of D2 remains to be determined, since a large segment within this domain can be deleted with no significant effect on RNA replication and virus production in cell culture (20) ; however, a recent study has demonstrated that D2 is required to suppress the activation of the interferon response (25) . NS5B is a tail-anchored RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8) ."
Evaluation of serological assays available in a biosafety level 2 laboratory and their application for survey of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus among livestock in Ethiopia,"A serological survey of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was conducted among dromedary camels and herbivorous animals sharing the same pasturage in Ethiopia. The pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus coated with the spike protein of MERS-CoV was used in virus neutralization (VN) tests performed in a biosafety level (BSL)-2 laboratory. The results were similar to those obtained from the VN test using live MERS-CoV and were more sensitive than the ELISA performed using synthetic MERS S1 fragment as the antigen as well as the competitive ELISA performed using a monoclonal antibody against MERS-CoV. According to the comprehensive results of the four types of serodiagnosis methods, positive antibodies were detected only in dromedary camels and the remaining herbivorous animals were not infected with the virus. Moreover, using the present procedure, serological tests for MERS-CoV can be conducted even in BSL 2 laboratory.","Pseudovirus VSV-MERS/GFP, a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype, integrated with the GFP gene and coated with the spike protein of MERS-CoV was used in the neutralization test [8] . The infectivity of VSV-MERS/GFP was detected based on GFP expression observed using fluorescence microscopy. GFP-expressing cells in photographic images were counted using VH analyzer. The VSV-MERS/GFP titers were then expressed as focus forming units (FFU) per ml."
Compartmentation of the Golgi Complex: Brefeldin-A Distinguishes trans-Golgi Cisternae from the trans-Golgi Network,"The Golgi complex is composed of at least four distinct compartments, termed the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi cisternae and the trans-Golgi network","(TGN). It has recently been reported that the organization of the Golgi complex is disrupted in cells treated with the fungal metabolite, brefeldin-A. Under these conditions, it was shown that resident enzymes of the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi return to the ER. We report here that 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors, when pulse-labeled within the ER of brefeldin-Atreated cells, acquired numerous N-linked galactose residues with a half time of approximately 2 h, as measured by their ability to bind to RCA-I lectin affinity columns. In contrast, Limax flavus lectin chromatography revealed that <10% of these receptors acquired sialic acid after 8 h in brefeldin-A. Two lines of evidence suggested that proteins within and beyond the TGN did not return to the ER in the presence of brefeldin-A. First, the majority of 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the TGN and endosomes did not return to the ER after up to 6 h in brefeldin-A, as determined by their failure to contact galactosyltransferase that had relocated there. Moreover, although marmose 6-phosphate receptors did not acquire sialic acid when present in the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, they were readily sialylated when labeled at the cell surface and transported to the TGN. These experiments indicate that galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme, returns to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin-A, while the bulk of sialyltransferase, a resident of the TGN, does not. Our findings support the proposal that the TGN is a distinct, fourth compartment of the Golgi apparatus that is insensitive to brefeldin-A."
Co-infections with Respiratory Viruses in Dogs with Bacterial Pneumonia,Background: Bacterial pneumonia (BP) is an inflammation of the lower airways and lung parenchyma secondary to bacterial infection. The pathogenesis of BP in dogs is complex and the role of canine respiratory viruses has not been fully evaluated.,"B acterial pneumonia (BP) is an acquired inflammation of the lower airways and lung parenchyma secondary to bacterial infection. 1 Because BP is difficult to induce experimentally in healthy animals, the pathogenesis is considered complex and involves several underlying mechanisms. 2 Possible predisposing factors for the development of BP, such as diseases leading to aspiration, decreased ciliary function, or immunodeficiency, have been described in Dogs. 3 However, the role of canine respiratory viruses in the development of BP and the possible connection between canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) and BP have not yet been fully evaluated."

Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of A549 Cells Infected with Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus* □ S,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract disease to which there is no vaccine or efficacious chemotherapeutic strategy. Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSVhost cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Addition-ally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.","Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) 1 is an enveloped RNA virus and a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, which includes common respiratory viruses such as those causing mumps and measles. HRSV is a leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children (1) and causes repeated infections throughout life. The severity of illness varies from bronchiolitis and pneumonia to common coldlike symptoms. Particular individuals at higher risk of disease include preterm infants, the immunocompromised, and elderly patients. One of the pathologies of the disease is an innate inflammatory response to infection in the lung, which could explain possible links between HRSV and asthma (2, 3) . The pathogenesis of HRSV is not well understood, and to date, the development of a vaccine has been unsuccessful (4) . Understanding the interaction for HRSV in particular, and for other viruses in general, with the host cell proteome, will aid in the design of effective antivirals and the development of possible vaccine strategies (5) ."
Neutralizing antibody responses to enterovirus and adenovirus in healthy adults in China,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an important public health problem that has emerged over the past several years. HFMD predominantly infects children under seven years old and occasionally causes severe disease in adults. Among the enteroviruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16) are the major causative agents of HFMD. In addition, adenovirus cocirculates with enterovirus and has become a possible additional pathogenic factor for HFMD in some cases. Here, we have investigated the neutralizing antibody responses to both enterovirus and adenovirus in adults, with the aim of exploring the prevalence trends of these viruses and the nature of protective immunity in humans to these viral infections. Sera from 391 healthy adults from 21 provinces and cities in China were tested for the presence of antibodies against EV71, CA16, adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 (AdC7) using neutralization tests. High seroprevalence rates of EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 were found in the population (85.7%, 58.8% and 74.2%, respectively). The coseropositivity rate of these three viruses was 39.4% (154 of 391), with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80, 40 and 640, respectively, and the neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 was found to be correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5. AdC7 was found to be a rare adenovirus serotype in the human population, with a seropositivity rate of 11.8%, suggesting that it could be a good choice for a vaccine carrier that could be used in vaccine development.","The enterovirus genus of single-stranded RNA viruses includes poliovirus, coxsackie A virus, coxsackie B virus, echoviruses and other viruses that affects millions of people worldwide each year. Over 100 human enterovirus serotypes have been identified based on antibody neutralization tests, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16), the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which has emerged as an important public health problem in recent years, especially in Asia and Pacific regions. EV71 and CA16 usually infect infants and children under seven years old and present with a papulovesicular rash. 1 A few children suffer complications such as myocarditis, pulmonary edema and aseptic meningoencephalitis, which can be fatal. Occasionally, HFMD is observed in adults. 2, 3 The major pathogens responsible for HFMD differ across countries. In China, HFMD is primarily associated with EV71, which caused the outbreaks of HFMD in Anhui province in 2008, in Guangdong province in 2009 and in Jiangsu province in 2012. [4] [5] [6] However, in other countries, HFMD is mostly associated with CA16. 7 The seroprevalence trends of these two viruses are changing over time. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Although immunoglobulins and the antiviral agent ribavirin are commonly used, their efficacy remains uncertain. 8 Thus, the development of effective vaccines to prevent HFMD is critical. Knowing the seroprevalence of EV71 and CA16 is necessary to generate a suitable and effective vaccine. The seroprevalence of EV71 and CA16 has been investigated in children and pregnant women, 6, [9] [10] [11] but little is known about the seroprevalence of these viruses in healthy adults, despite the fact that adults do suffer from HFMD and can present with serious symptoms. 2, 3 However, efforts to investigate the seroprevalence of these viruses in adults are increasing and may reflect the continued spread of these viruses."
Magnetic nanoparticle based purification and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibody against enrofloxacin,"Monoclonal anti-enrofloxacin antibody was prepared for a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and purification system using monoclonal antibody (mAb) coupled magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The IC50 values of the developed mAb for enrofloxacin (ENR), ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, sarafloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin were 5.0, 8.3, 9.7, 21.7, 36.0, and 63.7 ng/mL, respectively. The lowest detectable level of ENR was 0.7 ng/mL in the prepared ELISA system. To validate the developed ELISA in the food matrix, known amounts of ENR were spiked in meat and egg samples at 10, 20 and 30 ng/mL. Recoveries for ENR ranged from 72.9 to 113.16% with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.42 to 10.11%. The applicability of the mAb-MNP system was verified by testing the recoveries for ENR residue in three different matrices. Recoveries for ENR ranged from 75.16 to 86.36%, while the CV ranged from 5.08 to 11.53%. Overall, ENR-specific monoclonal antibody was prepared and developed for use in competitive to ELISAs for the detection of ENR in animal meat samples. Furthermore, we suggest that a purification system for ENR using mAb-coupled MNPs could be useful for determination of ENR residue in food.","Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been widely used as human and veterinary drugs, especially for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases in domestic animals, poultry, and fish [21] . FQs act through inhibition of DNA-gyrase, abolishing activity by interfering with the DNA rejoining reaction [3, 14] . The widespread use of FQs has led to contaminating residues in foodstuffs derived from treated animals, which can induce unwanted reactions such as erythema, burning, and itching in humans and animals [25] . Furthermore, antibiotics released into the natural ecosystem can modify the local environmental microbiota by changing the composition or activity [1, 23] . Many regulatory agencies have established a maximum residue limit for FQs in milk, meat, and other foods [5, 6] .

Ad Hoc Influenza Vaccination During Years of Significant Antigenic Drift in a Tropical City With 2 Seasonal Peaks A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Health Care Practitioners,We evaluated the acceptability of an additional ad hoc influenza vaccination among the health care professionals following seasons with significant antigenic drift.,"G lobally, influenza is a highly contagious and serious respiratory disease that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Its annual attack rate is estimated at 5% to 10% in adults and 20% to 30% in children, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness with an annual death toll of 250,000 to 500,000. 1 Influenza vaccination may reduce the number of hospital admissions by 25% to 39%, and has been shown to reduce overall mortality by 39% to 75%. 2 The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified priority at-risk groups for influenza immunization, which include pregnant women, children aged between 6 months and 5 years, persons older than 65 years, patients with chronic medical conditions, and health care workers. 3 To achieve the best possible match between vaccine and circulating strains, the WHO Collaborating Centres for the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System regularly performs antigenic and genetic analyses, 4 and make recommendations for vaccine strains twice a year for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively."
Delicate structural coordination of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus Nsp13 upon ATP hydrolysis,"To date, an effective therapeutic treatment that confers strong attenuation toward coronaviruses (CoVs) remains elusive. Of all the potential drug targets, the helicase of CoVs is considered to be one of the most important. Here, we first present the structure of the full-length Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV (SARS-Nsp13) and investigate the structural coordination of its five domains and how these contribute to its translocation and unwinding activity. A translocation model is proposed for the Upf1like helicase members according to three different structural conditions in solution characterized through H/D exchange assay, including substrate state (SARS-Nsp13-dsDNA bound with AMPPNP), transition state (bound with ADP-AlF 4 − ) and product state (bound with ADP). We observed that the ␤19-␤20 loop on the 1A domain is involved in unwinding process directly. Furthermore, we have shown that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), SARS-Nsp12, can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 through interacting with it directly. The interacting regions were identified and can be considered common across CoVs, which provides new insights into the Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC) of CoVs.","The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 was the first opportunity to allow investigation of a coronavirus (CoV) that was a severe human pathogen. A decade later, a similar coronavirus termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged, but alarmingly this virus has higher case-fatality rates than SARS-CoV. Thus, there is a refocussing of the world's attention onto CoVs. The fact that no therapeutic treatments are available for CoVs is a serious concern (1,2). It is therefore necessary to study the life cycle of CoVs to develop new ideas for effective vaccines or drugs."

Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells from Mice with an Altered Microbiota Provide Interleukin 17A-Dependent Protection against Entamoeba histolytica Colitis,"There is an emerging paradigm that the human microbiome is central to many aspects of health and may have a role in preventing enteric infection. Entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of amebic diarrhea in developing countries. It colonizes the colon lumen in close proximity to the gut microbiota. Interestingly, not all individuals are equally susceptible to E. histolytica infection. Therefore, as the microbiota is highly variable within individuals, we sought to determine if a component of the microbiota could regulate susceptibility to infection. In studies utilizing a murine model, we demonstrated that colonization of the gut with the commensal Clostridia-related bacteria known as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) is protective during E. histolytica infection. SFB colonization in this model was associated with elevated cecal levels of interleukin 17A (IL-17A), dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from SFB-colonized mice had higher levels of IL-23 production in response to stimulation with trophozoites. Adoptive transfer of BMDCs from an SFB ؉ to an SFB ؊ mouse was sufficient to provide protection against E. histolytica. IL-17A induction during BMDC transfer was necessary for this protection.","port neutrophil infiltration in inflammatory-disease models (10) (11) (12) (13) . Neutrophils play a central role in cell-mediated clearance of parasites and may be important in clearance of E. histolytica (14) . IgA was also implicated in protection against E. histolytica infection in a childhood cohort and thus may be involved in immunity against the parasite (15) . Given that IL-17A and downstream mediators are important in immunity to E. histolytica, components of the intestinal microbiota that elicit exogenous IL-17A in the absence of intestinal pathology might prove to be protective during amebiasis."

Competitive Fitness in Coronaviruses Is Not Correlated with Size or Number of Double-Membrane Vesicles under Reduced-Temperature Growth Conditions,"Positive-stranded viruses synthesize their RNA in membrane-bound organelles, but it is not clear how this benefits the virus or the host. For coronaviruses, these organelles take the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) interconnected by a convoluted membrane network. We used electron microscopy to identify murine coronaviruses with mutations in nsp3 and nsp14 that replicated normally while producing only half the normal amount of DMVs under low-temperature growth conditions. Viruses with mutations in nsp5 and nsp16 produced small DMVs but also replicated normally. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed that the most strongly affected of these, the nsp3 mutant, produced more viral RNA than wild-type virus. Competitive growth assays were carried out in both continuous and primary cells to better understand the contribution of DMVs to viral fitness. Surprisingly, several viruses that produced fewer or smaller DMVs showed a higher fitness than wild-type virus at the reduced temperature, suggesting that larger and more numerous DMVs do not necessarily confer a competitive advantage in primary or continuous cell culture. For the first time, this directly demonstrates that replication and organelle formation may be, at least in part, studied separately during infection with positive-stranded RNA virus.","essential processing by proteinases located in nsp3 (18) and nsp5 (19) . Electron microscopy suggests that nsp3 induces membrane proliferation (17) . nsp3 and nsp4 localize predominantly to the CM in DMV clusters (4, 9, 20) and are sufficient to induce structures resembling CMs in the absence of other viral proteins (17) . Mutations in nsp4 have been linked to formation of aberrant DMVs with apparent defects in membrane pairing (21) . nsp6 from several coronaviruses causes single-membrane LC3containing vesicles (22) to accumulate around microtubule organization centers (17) , although it is not clear how this is connected to the formation of DMV clusters."

The objective of this study was to perform a direct comparison of three multiplex RT-PCR assays for the detection of respiratory viruses.","available faster than those of viral cultures. Speed to result allows medical professionals to prescribe antiviral agents and perform appropriate infection control more rapidly. Lastly, NAAT does not need a strict transportation protocol for maintaining viability of RV. 3 In addition, the application of multiplexing technology in NAAT allows better detection than classical methods of a broad range of viruses. For all of these reasons NAAT has replaced classical methods."
2009 H1N1 Influenza and Experience in Three Critical Care Units,"We describe futures of ICU admission, demographic characteristics, treatment and outcome for critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed and suspected infection with the H1N1 virus admitted to the three different critical care departments in Turkey. Methods: Retrospective study of critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) at ICU. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes were collected using a case report form. Results: Critical illness occurred in 61 patients admitted to an ICU with confirmed (n=45) or probable and suspected 2009 influenza A(H1N1). Patients were young (mean, 41.5 years), were female (54%). Fifty-six patients, required mechanical ventilation (14 invasive, 27 noninvasive, 15 both) during the course of ICU. On admission, mean APACHE II score was 18.7±6.3 and median PaO 2 /FIO 2 was 127.9±70.4. 31 patients (50.8%) was die. There were no significant differences in baseline PaO 2 /FIO 2 and ventilation strategies between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who survived were more likely to have NIMV use at the time of admission to the ICU. Conclusion: Critical illness from 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in ICU predominantly affects young patients with little major comorbidity and had a high case-fatality rate. NIMV could be used in 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related hypoxemic respiratory failure.","In 2009, cases of influenza like illness were first reported in Mexico on March 18; the outbreak was subsequently confirmed as H1N1 influenza.

Oligomerization of a Membrane Protein Correlates with Its Retention in the Golgi Complex,"The first membrane-spanning domain (ml) of the M glycoprotein of avian coronavirus (formerly called El) is sufficient to retain this protein in the cis-Golgi. When the membrane-spanning domain of a protein which is efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane (VSV G protein) is replaced with ml, the resulting chimera (Gml) is retained in the Golgi (Swift, A. M., and C. E. Machamer. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115:19-30). When assayed in sucrose gradients, we observed that Gml formed a large oligomer, and that much of this oligomer was SDS resistant and stayed near the top of the stacking gel of an SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The unusual stability of the oligomer allowed it to be detected easily. Gml mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the ml domain that were retained in the Golgi complex formed SDS-resistant oligomers, whereas mutants that were rapidly released to the plasma membrane did not. Oligomerization was not detected immediately after synthesis of Gml, but occurred gradually with a lag of ,',,10 rain, suggesting that it is not merely aggregation of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, oligomer-1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-cldorophenylhydrazone; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus.","ization did not occur under several conditions that block ER to Golgi transport. The lumenal domain was not required for oligomerization since another chimera (otmlG), where the lumenal domain of Gml was replaced by the o~ subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, also formed an SDS-resistant oligomer, and was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gml as revealed by coprecipitation experiments. SDS resistance was conferred by the cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, because proteolytic digestion of the tail in microsomes containing Gml oligomers resulted in loss of SDS resistance, although the protease-treated material continued to migrate as a large oligomer on sucrose gradients. Interestingly, treatment of cells with cytochalasin D blocked formation of SDS-resistant (but not SDS-sensitive) oligomers. Our data suggest that SDS-resistant oligomers form as newly synthesized molecules of Gml arrive at the Golgi complex and may interact (directly or indirectly) with an actinbased cytoskeletal matrix. The oligomerization of Gml and other resident proteins could serve as a mechanism for their retention in the Golgi complex."
Practical use of povidone-iodine antiseptic in the maintenance of oral health and in the prevention and treatment of common oropharyngeal infections,"Aims: To better inform medical practitioners on the role of antiseptics in oropharyngeal health and disease, this article focuses on povidone-iodine (PVP-I), an established and widely-available antiseptic agent. Methodology: Review of the anti-infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP-I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo-pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). Results: Antiseptics with broad-spectrum anti-infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence-base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. Conclusion: The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large-scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control.","The status of the oral and oropharyngeal cavities, which includes the mouth and throat, is inextricably linked to the general health and well-being of an individual (1) . Colonisation by pathogenic micro-organisms or an imbalance of the physiological microbiome in the oral cavity can play an essential role in the development and perpetuation of disease (2, 3) . Indeed, viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa can give rise to many common oral and oropharyngeal conditions, as diverse as dental caries, periodontal disease, gingivitis, as well as upper respiratory tract infections such as sore throat, common cold and influenza (2) . In the hospital setting, colonisation of pathogens in the oropharyngeal region can result in more serious sequelae in intubated patients, where their spread into the lower respiratory tract can result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (4) . This underscores the importance of exercising good mouth and throat hygiene as a means of minimising risk in the development of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections."

Binding of the 5 0 -untranslated region of coronavirus RNA to zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 enhances viral replication and transcription,"Coronaviruses RNA synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm and is regulated by host cell proteins. In a screen based on a yeast three-hybrid system using the 5 0 -untranslated region (5 0 -UTR) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA as bait against a human cDNA library derived from HeLa cells, we found a positive candidate cellular protein, zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (MADP1), to be able to interact with this region of the SARS-CoV genome. This interaction was subsequently confirmed in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The specificity of the interaction between MADP1 and the 5 0 -UTR of IBV was investigated and confirmed by using an RNA pull-down assay. The RNA-binding domain was mapped to the N-terminal region of MADP1 and the protein binding sequence to stem-loop I of IBV 5 0 -UTR. MADP1 was found to be translocated to the cytoplasm and partially co-localized with the viral replicase/transcriptase complexes (RTCs) in IBVinfected cells, deviating from its usual nuclear localization in a normal cell using indirect immunofluorescence. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MADP1, defective viral RNA synthesis was observed in the knockdown cells, therefore indicating the importance of the protein in coronaviral RNA synthesis.","During the replication of mammalian viruses, it is inevitable for host proteins to be involved in the viral life cycles. In fact, coronaviruses require host proteins to aid in the stages from virus entry to progeny release. Entry of the virus particle into a host cell requires the recognition of specific cell surface proteins, which act as receptors for the virus spike (S) protein (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Upon entry into host cells, the ribonucleocapsid uncoats and releases the 5 0 -capped viral genome, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The genomic RNA ranges from 27 to 32 kb in length, is the largest known of its kind and is structurally similar to host mRNA (7) . The replicase gene, which spans the 5 0 two-thirds of the genome, is translated by host ribosomes into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab via a frameshift event (8) (9) (10) . The polyproteins are autoproteolytically processed into a maximum of 16 nonstructural proteins (8, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , which are assembled into replicationtranscription complexes, including the main enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) (17, 18) . This complex is required for generating new full-length virus RNA in replication as well as subgenome-length RNAs to be used for translation of virus structural and accessory proteins. In addition to their role in RNA synthesis, these nonstructural proteins may have multiple functions, such as the suppression of host mRNA translation as well as mRNA degradation by nsp1 of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV; [19] [20] [21] , which may play a role in the suppression of immune response mounted by the host upon infection."
Sorting Signals in the MHC Class II Invariant Chain Cytoplasmic Taft and Transmembrane Region Determine Trafficking to an Endocytic Processing Compartment,"Targeting of MHC class II molecules to the endocytic compartment where they encounter processed antigen is determined by the invariant chain 0i). By analysis of Ii-transferrin receptor (TR) chimera trafficking, we have identified sorting signals in the Ii cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region that mediate this process. Two non-tyrosine-based sorting signals in the Ii cytoplasmic tail were identified that mediate localization to plasma membrane clathrincoated pits and promote rapid endocytosis. Leu 7 and Ile s were required for the activity of the signal most distal to the cell membrane whereas pro15 Met16 L~ul7 were important for the membrane-proximal signal.","Ii-TR chimera containing the Ii cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region is delivered directly to the endocytic pathway by an intracellular route, implying that the Ii sorting signals are efficiently recognized by sorting machinery located in the trans-Golgi. M AJOR histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 class 1I molecules are polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins expressed primarily on specialized antigenpresenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes. They bind peptides derived from exogenous proteins and present them to CD4 + helper T cells as part of the mechanism for recognizing foreign antigens and stimulating an immune response. MHC class II molecules displayed on the cell surface are ct/3 heterodimers, but during their intracellular transport to the cell surface, they are transiently associated with a third nonpolymorphic polypeptide, the invariant chain (Ii) . Ii is a type II membrane protein with different isoforms that arise from alternative splicing of one exon and the use of two translation initiation sites (Strubin et al., 1986; O'Sullivan et al., 1987; Koch et al., 1987) ."
,"MBoC | ARTICLE In wound repair vimentin mediates the transition of mesenchymal leader cells to a myofibroblast phenotype ABSTRACT Following injury, mesenchymal repair cells are activated to function as leader cells that modulate wound healing. These cells have the potential to differentiate to myofibroblasts, resulting in fibrosis and scarring. The signals underlying these differing pathways are complex and incompletely understood. The ex vivo mock cataract surgery cultures are an attractive model with which to address this question. With this model we study, concurrently, the mechanisms that control mesenchymal leader cell function in injury repair within their native microenvironment and the signals that induce this same cell population to acquire a myofibroblast phenotype when these cells encounter the environment of the adjacent tissue culture platform. Here we show that on injury, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is released into the extracellular space, binds to the cell surface of the mesenchymal leader cells located at the wound edge in the native matrix environment, and supports wound closure. In profibrotic environments, the extracellular vimentin pool also links specifically to the mesenchymal leader cells and has an essential role in signaling their fate change to a myofibroblast. These findings suggest a novel role for extracellular, cell-surface-associated vimentin in mediating repair-cell function in wound repair and in transitioning these cells to a myofibroblast phenotype.","In the normal repair process, mesenchymal cell populations restore tissue function in response to tissue insult or injury; however, their susceptibility to becoming myofibroblasts results in a response that promotes and sustains the fibrotic disease process. Fibrosis is a devastating progressive disease, its pathology characterized by the excessive production of extracellular matrix proteins like collagen I, with myofibroblasts being a major producer of this fibrosis-causing matrix. Fibrosis affects almost every organ of the body, causing irreparable damage wherever it occurs (Carver and Goldsmith, 2013) ."
A Microarray Based Approach for the Identification of Common Foodborne Viruses,"An oligonucleotide array (microarray) incorporating 13,000 elements representing selected strains of hepatitis A virus (HAV), human coxsackieviruses A and B (CVA and CVB), genogroups I and II of Norovirus (NV), and human rotavirus (RV) gene segments 3,4,10, and 11 was designed based on the principle of tiling. Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5 th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy3-labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target. The results obtained with HAV and CV indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains. This represents a significant improvement over current methods for virus identification using PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing.","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled to reverse transcription (RT) represents the most significant improvement in the area of RNA virus detection over classical cell culture based methods. In the classical culture based method, the principal mode of virus identification uses growth of the virus in permissive cells and observation of the morphological changes brought about by virus replication in the host cell [1] . Although it is possible to differentiate between cytopathic and non-cytopathic hepatitis A virus (HAV) strains due to a difference in the morphology of infected cells [2] , in practice such morphological identification is of limited value because the morphological effects are cell-line specific, and many viruses in the same genus (e.g. Enterovirus) produce rapid and similar cytopathic changes in many of the celllines normally used for virus detection. Moreover, using multiple cell-lines for virus detection is also labor intensive and time consuming, and further confirmation and identification often requires the use of additional techniques such as serotyping [1] ."
Clinical Progression and Cytokine Profiles of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection,"Clinical progression over time and cytokine profiles have not been well defined in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. We included 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in serial serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients presented with fever. The median time to defervescence was 18 days. Nine patients required oxygen supplementation and classified into severe group. In the severe group, chest infiltrates suddenly began to worsen around day 7 of illness, and dyspnea developed at the end of the first week and became apparent in the second week. Median time from symptom onset to oxygen supplementation was 8 days. The severe group had higher neutrophil counts during week 1 than the mild group (4,500 vs. 2,200/µL, P = 0.026). In the second week of illness, the severe group had higher serum levels of IL-6 (54 vs. 4 pg/mL, P = 0.006) and CXCL-10 (2,642 vs. 382 pg/mL, P < 0.001). IFN-α response was not observed in mild cases. Our data shows that clinical condition may suddenly deteriorate around 7 days of illness and the serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL-10 was significantly elevated in MERS-CoV patients who developed severe diseases.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is a highly lethal respiratory disease that has recently emerged in the Middle East region.

"Drug Design, Development and Therapy Dovepress Virtual screening for potential inhibitors of Mcl-1 conformations sampled by normal modes, molecular dynamics, and nuclear magnetic resonance","Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is often overexpressed in human cancer and is an important target for developing antineoplastic drugs. In this study, a data set containing 2.3 million lead-like molecules and a data set of all the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs are virtually screened for potential Mcl-1 ligands using Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2MHS. The potential Mcl-1 ligands are evaluated and computationally docked on to three conformation ensembles generated by normal mode analysis (NMA), molecular dynamics (MD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), respectively. The evaluated potential Mcl-1 ligands are then compared with their clinical use. Remarkably, half of the top 30 potential drugs are used clinically to treat cancer, thus partially validating our virtual screen. The partial validation also favors the idea that the other half of the top 30 potential drugs could be used in the treatment of cancer. The normal mode-, MD-, and NMR-based conformation greatly expand the conformational sampling used herein for in silico identification of potential Mcl-1 inhibitors.","Apoptosis is a highly conserved and regulated process for eliminating damaged and surplus cells, such as those generated during normal embryonic development and abnormal cancer. 1 Important regulators of this process are the B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins, which include pro-and anti-apoptotic members. Antiapoptotic (ie, pro-survival) members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), whereas pro-apoptotic members include Bax-like proteins, such as Bax, Bak, and Bok, and BH3-only proteins, such as Bad, Bim, Bmf, Bik, Hrk, Bid, Puma, and Noxa. 2 The interaction of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins with regulators is a key element of cell survival and death."
Distinctive clinical features of HPeV-3 infection in 2 neonates with a sepsis-like illness,"We report a human parechovirus-3 (HPeV-3) infection in 2 neonates who had prolonged fever (>5 days) with palmar-plantar erythema. This distinctive rash was observed 4-5 days after fever onset, just before defervescence. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels were characteristic laboratory findings in the 2 cases, suggesting tissue damage caused by hypercytokinemia. Case 1 was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, considering the possibility of severe systemic inflammatory responses. The initial ferritin level was 385 ng/mL (range, 0-400 ng/mL); however, the level increased to 2,581 ng/dL on day 5 after fever onset. Case 2 presented with milder clinical symptoms, and the patient recovered spontaneously. HPeV-3 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood samples, but no other causative agents were detected. The findings from our cases, in accordance with recent studies, suggest that clinical features such as palmarplantar erythema and/or hyperferritinemia might be indicators of HPeV-3 infection in neonates with sepsis-like illness. In clinical practice, where virology testing is not easily accessible, clinical features such as palmar-plantar erythema and/or hyperferritinemia might be helpful to diagnose HPeV-3 infection.","Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are newly recognized single-stranded RNA viruses that were formerly classified in the Enterovirus genus 1) . Among 16 HPeV serotypes, HPeV-3 infection occurs most frequently among infants below the age of 3 months 2) . Since HPeV-3 was first isolated in Japan in 1999 1) , the HPeV serotype has been increasingly identified as an important pathogen of sepsis-like illness and central nervous system infections in neonates and young infants 3) . Life-threatening illnesses such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis have been reported in neonatal HPeV-3 infection 4) . However, the major clinical features displayed by patients with HPeV-3 infection are also common in those suffering from severe infectious diseases caused by other pathogens 5) . Thus, the diagnosis of HPeV-3 infection is difficult based only on clinical signs."
Supplementary Information,"The de novo and ancestral genes can be identified with the greatest reliability under three conditions: a) the de novo gene is restricted to a monophyletic clade (the focal clade), whereas the ancestral gene is found throughout this clade but also in an outgroup clade; b) all the de novo genes within the focal clade share significant sequence similarity; c) the overlapping regions of the ancestral genes share significant sequence similarity within the focal clade but also with the outgroup taxa. These conditions were met for most the overlaps used in our analysis. We explain below our approach to identify the de novo and ancestral genes in overlaps where these conditions were not met.","are the results of two independent origins, is less parsimonious. Because the black gene has no significant sequence similarity with the other genes in the clade, we did not use it for calculations of relative divergence and selective constraint. This scenario corresponds to taxa (4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) in which one (taxa 4, 8, and 9) or two (taxa 5 and 6) de novo genes within a monophyletic clade have no sequence similarity."
current Review Rhinitis in children less than 6 years of age: current knowledge and challenges,"Rhinitis is a disease of the upper airway characterized by runny and/or blocked nose and/or sneezing. Though not viewed as a life threatening condition, it is also recognized to impose significant burden to the quality of life of sufferers and their caretakers and imposes an economic cost to society. Through a PubMed online search of the literature from 2006 to September 2011, this paper aims to review the published literature on rhinitis in young children below the age of 6 years. It is apparent from epidemiology studies that rhinitis in this age group is a relatively common problem. The condition has a heterogenous etiology with classification into allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Respiratory viral infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of long standing rhinitis, but definitive studies are still lacking. Treatment guidelines for management are lacking for this age group, and is a significant unmet need. Although the consensus is that co-morbidities including otitis media with effusion, adenoidal hypertrophy and asthma, are important considerations of management of these children. Pharmacotherapy is limited for young children especially for those below the age of 2 years. This review underscores the lack of understanding of rhinitis in early childhood and therefore the need for further research in this area.

The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guideline classifies rhinitis into allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) based on the presence and absence of allergic sensitization. AR arises due to IgE-mediated mechanisms and is usually characterized with additional symptoms of itchy eyes (conjunctivitis). NAR has multiple possible triggers including infectious, hormonal, occupational, and idiopathic (previously termed as vasomotor rhinitis) [2] . It could well be that rhinitis in young children would involve both components of AR and NAR."
Capital District Health Authority Nova Scotia,Background. Seasonal influenza epidemics occur frequently. Rapid characterization of seasonal dynamics and forecasting of epidemic peaks and final sizes could help support real-time decision-making related to vaccination and other control measures. Real-time forecasting remains challenging.,"Seasonal epidemics of influenza A and B viruses occur frequently. These viruses infect the respiratory tract and typically cause fever, cough, and muscle and joint pain [1] . In some individuals, particularly young children and the elderly, influenza infection may lead to severe illness or death [1] [2] [3] . Seasonal influenza also places a strain on economic productivity due to employee absenteeism [4] and exhaustion of healthcare resources due to increased hospitalization [5] ."
The rOX-stars of inflammation: links between the inflammasome and mitochondrial meltdown,"The nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome drives inflammation in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. As metabolic powerhouses with prokaryotic ancestry, mitochondria are a cache for danger-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular pattern-like molecules that elicit potent innate immune responses. Persistent mitochondrial damage caused by infection, or genetic or environmental factors, can lead to inappropriate or sustained inflammasome signalling. Here, we review the features of mitochondria that drive inflammatory signalling, with a particular focus on mitochondrial activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Given that mitochondrial network dynamics, metabolic activity and redox state are all intricately linked to each other and to NLRP3 inflammasome activity, we highlight the importance of a holistic approach to investigations of NLRP3 activation by dysfunctional mitochondria.","Mitochondria are hubs for metabolic activity, where they produce ATP required for cellular functions. Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles, as they are ancestrally derived from a bacterial endosymbiont that integrated with an early eukaryote precursor. 1 Many components of mitochondria have their origins in the mitochondrion's bacterial ancestry, such as CpG-rich mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the matrix and cardiolipin in the inner membrane. Such bacterially derived mitochondrial molecules can induce important immunomodulatory mechanisms. 2 Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are at the interface between mitochondria and innate immunity. PRRs have evolved to recognise and respond to foreign agents (pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs) and specific 'self' molecules whose mislocalisation or modification indicates cell stress or infection (danger-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs). Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) is a cytosolic PRR activated by a wide range of PAMPs (bacterial toxins, fungal and viral components) and DAMPs (e.g. extracellular ATP, lysosomal-disrupting crystals), including those of mitochondrial origin. While NLRP3 signalling is generally host-protective, inappropriate or sustained NLRP3 activation drives hereditary autoinflammatory (e.g. cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes) and acquired (e.g. gouty arthritis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) diseases. 3 Nod-like receptor protein 3 signals by forming a caspase-1-activating complex called the NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon activation, NLRP3 selfassociates and engages with the signal adaptor, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which then interacts with caspase-1 to form the inflammasome. 4 Active caspase-1 then cleaves various substrates to induce inflammatory signalling, including the cytokines IL-1b and IL-18, and the cell executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD), which induces a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis. 5 The subcellular location of NLRP3 activation remains controversial, with various reports locating active NLRP3 at cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane, the attachment points between the mitochondria and ER, 6 or the dispersed trans-Golgi network. 7 In murine in vitro systems, NLRP3 activation generally follows a 2-step model. 8 Signal 1 is usually a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist. Signal 1 activates the nuclear factor jlight-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-jB) pathway to transcriptionally upregulate NLRP3 and pro-IL-1b, and induce NLRP3 posttranslational modifications that poise NLRP3 for signalling. A plethora of PAMPs and DAMPs can provide the 2nd signal, which is the 'trigger' for NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. These PAMPs and DAMPs induce one or more key features of disrupted cytosolic homoeostasis -K + efflux, lysosomal rupture or the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)to induce NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and signalling."
Performance of TEM-PCR vs Culture for Bacterial Identification in Pediatric Musculoskeletal Infections,"Improved diagnostics are needed for children with musculoskeletal infections (MSKIs). We assessed the performance of target-enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (TEM-PCR) in children with MSKI. TEM-PCR was concordant with culture in pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing, while increasing the overall yield of pathogen detection. This technology has the potential to inform judicious antimicrobial use early in the disease course.","Musculoskeletal infections (MSKIs; osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and pyomyositis) require prompt diagnosis and treatment due to the risk of local tissue damage and metastatic bacterial spread. Currently, pathogen identification requires culture from a sterile site (eg, blood, bone, or joint fluid); however, nearly half of all MSKIs in children remain culture-negative [1] [2] [3] . The absence of pathogen identification has important implications for the treatment of children with MSKI as the prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) often justifies broad empiric antibiotic regimens. Additionally, resistance to commonly used antistaphylococcal antibiotics continues to increase across multiple antibiotic classes and among both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains [4] [5] [6] . Taken together, it has become increasingly difficult to select empiric antimicrobial regimens with sufficient breadth and safety."
"Emerging Microbes and Infections (2012) 1, e31","Patrick Manson, a clinician-scientist serving in China (1866±1889), discovered that many tropical infectious diseases require a vector peculiar to warm climate for person to person transmission. He demonstrated the nocturnal periodicity of microfilariae in the blood of patients with elephantiasis. These microfilariae undergo metamorphosis when ingested by the mosquito acting as the vector for the completion of their life cycle. Furthermore, he demonstrated the linkage between the lung fluke and endemic haemoptysis by finding operculated eggs in patients' sputa. He predicted that the miracidium from hatched eggs uses crustaceans, such as fresh-water snails found at tropical conditions, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle of many trematodes. His vector hypothesis leads to vector control which is now the cornerstone for the World Health Organization's programme for the elimination/control of lymphatic filariasis, dracunculiasis and malaria. Before leaving China, he established the Alice Memorial Hospital, the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (the forerunner of the University of Hong Kong), and the Hong Kong Medical Society for medical service and education. He also incepted the Hong Kong Dairy Farm for supplying hygienic milk affordable by pregnant women, children and patients.","Manson started as a clinician whose initial involvement in the Far East partly resulted from the colonialistic needs of the British Empire in Asia; however, his work proved to be more than advancing the understanding of exotic diseases by Europeans. His research finding is lifesaving. His clinical service changed the perception of the Chinese people to Western medicine. He laid the foundations for medical education in Hong Kong for the centuries to come. We trace the footsteps of Manson who adventured into the tropics, also known as white men's grave in those days, and how he became the indisputable founder of modern tropical medicine."
Highly dynamic animal contact network and implications on disease transmission,"Contact patterns among hosts are considered as one of the most critical factors contributing to unequal pathogen transmission. Consequently, networks have been widely applied in infectious disease modeling. However most studies assume static network structure due to lack of accurate observation and appropriate analytic tools. In this study we used high temporal and spatial resolution animal position data to construct a high-resolution contact network relevant to infectious disease transmission. The animal contact network aggregated at hourly level was highly variable and dynamic within and between days, for both network structure (network degree distribution) and individual rank of degree distribution in the network (degree order). We integrated network degree distribution and degree order heterogeneities with a commonly used contact-based, directly transmitted disease model to quantify the effect of these two sources of heterogeneity on the infectious disease dynamics. Four conditions were simulated based on the combination of these two heterogeneities. Simulation results indicated that disease dynamics and individual contribution to new infections varied substantially among these four conditions under both parameter settings. Changes in the contact network had a greater effect on disease dynamics for pathogens with smaller basic reproduction number (i.e. R 0 , 2).","I nfectious individuals can contribute differently to new infections, and variation in contacts among hosts is one of the most important factors contributing to unequal pathogen transmission 1, 2 . Contact rates vary because of differences in individual traits, including individual behavior, as well as changes in the overall contact patterns along time and across space. Network theory has been extensively applied to understand and model contact patterns, and epidemiology is one of the most active areas in which network theory is applied 3 . Networks have been used extensively to describe the underlying contact patterns for sexually transmitted diseases and other directly transmitted diseases across large spatial scales. Recently, characterization of contact networks within community settings such as hospitals, schools, or households has been recognized as necessary to accurately predict transmission dynamics and identify interventions for diseases that require close contacts. Confined environments may have spatial ''hotspots'' for disease transmission, and defining the contact network is integral for effective control programs. Transmission in hospitals contributed approximately 50% of all secondary infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong in 2003 4 , and transmission within schools fueled the fall 2009 wave of pandemic influenza H1N1 in the United States 5 . Technology advances, such as proximity loggers and radio-frequency identification devices, have facilitated the construction of high-resolution contact networks relevant to infectious diseases that require close contacts among hosts [6] [7] [8] . Analysis of generated contact networks have confirmed high contact rates in community settings, and provided insights into the network structure in these types of settings and their implication for disease transmission [6] [7] [8] [9] ."
Positive-sense RNA viruses reveal the complexity and dynamics of the cellular and viral epitranscriptomes during infection,"More than 140 post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) are known to decorate cellular RNAs, but their incidence, identity and significance in viral RNA are still largely unknown. We have developed an agnostic analytical approach to comprehensively survey PTMs on viral and cellular RNAs. Specifically, we used mass spectrometry to analyze PTMs on total RNA isolated from cells infected with Zika virus, Dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. All five RNA viruses significantly altered global PTM landscapes. Examination of PTM profiles of individual viral genomes isolated by affinity capture revealed a plethora of PTMs on viral RNAs, which far exceeds the handful of well-characterized modifications. Direct comparison of viral epitranscriptomes identified common and virus-specific PTMs. In particular, specific dimethylcytosine modifications were only present in total RNA from virus-infected cells, and in intracellular HCV RNA, and viral RNA from Zika and HCV virions. Moreover, dimethylcytosine abundance during viral infection was modulated by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6. By opening the Pandora's box on viral PTMs, this report presents numerous questions and hypotheses on PTM function and strongly supports PTMs as a new tier of regulation by which RNA viruses subvert the host and evade cellular surveillance systems.","Enzymatic modification of RNA is rapidly emerging as a general mechanism for modulating the function of RNA (1) (2) (3) . To date, ∼140 post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) of the canonical ribonucleotides have been discovered (4, 5) , which contribute to the extraordinary structural diversity of natural RNA (6, 7) . At the molecular level, PTMs can affect the stability of individual base pairs and establish different hydrogen-bonding patterns to redefine the higher order structure of RNA (8, 9) . Moreover, PTMs influence intermolecular interactions involved in protein recruiting, DNA binding and recognition of other RNA. For instance, the absence of specific pseudouridines in rRNA of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae undermines the stability of the entire fold, which leads to disruption of ribosome assembly (10, 11) . Unmodified tRNAs are not loaded efficiently with their respective aminoacyl groups, and some modifications prevent incorrect loading altogether (12) . Hypermodified nucleotides in the tRNA anticodon loop can affect codon-anticodon interactions, which may impair the accuracy of RNA-RNA recognition and foster translational recoding (13) . Last, methylation of the terminal nucleotide protects siRNAs and microRNAs from 3 -uridylation that promotes nuclease binding and degradation (14) . The discovery of specific enzymes responsible for introducing, removing and interpreting PTMs (i.e. writers, erasers and readers, listed in the MODOMICS database) (15, 16) accounts for the dynamic nature of PTMs and sensitivity to the general health, epigenetic, and metabolic state of the cell."
Hydrocortisone therapy in a cat with vasopressor-refractory septic shock and suspected critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency Key Clinical Message,"A 27-month-old female cat was presented with septic peritonitis secondary to a ruptured pyometra and subsequent pyothorax. Vasopressor-refractory septic shock led to a suspicion of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, successfully treated with intravenous hydrocortisone. Previous megestrol acetate administration may have played a role in the development of adrenocortical dysfunction.","The syndrome of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI), previously known as relative adrenal insufficiency, is defined as an endocrinological dysfunction in critically ill patients, resulting in inadequate cortisol activity for the existing severity of illness and leading to fluid-and vasopressor-refractory shock [1] [2] [3] . It may result from alterations in one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and glucocorticoid metabolism pathways or from decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and tissue response to corticosteroids [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, its multifactorial pathophysiology is only partially understood, and there is no absolute consensus regarding criteria for the diagnosis of CIRCI in either human or veterinary medicine. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends considering a patient to be affected by CIRCI if vasopressor-resistant shock is responsive to supplementation with hydrocortisone [9] ."
CoVDB: a comprehensive database for comparative analysis of coronavirus genes and genomes,"The recent SARS epidemic has boosted interest in the discovery of novel human and animal coronaviruses. By July 2007, more than 3000 coronavirus sequence records, including 264 complete genomes, are available in GenBank. The number of coronavirus species with complete genomes available has increased from 9 in 2003 to 25 in 2007, of which six, including coronavirus HKU1, bat SARS coronavirus, group 1 bat coronavirus HKU2, groups 2c and 2d coronaviruses, were sequenced by our laboratory. To overcome the problems we encountered in the existing databases during comparative sequence analysis, we built a comprehensive database, CoVDB (http://covdb.microbiology. hku.hk), of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes. CoVDB provides a convenient platform for rapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval, the cornerstone and bottleneck for comparative gene or genome analysis. Sequences can be directly downloaded from the website in FASTA format. CoVDB also provides detailed annotation of all coronavirus sequences using a standardized nomenclature system, and overcomes the problems of duplicated and identical sequences in other databases. For complete genomes, a single representative sequence for each species is available for comparative analysis such as phylogenetic studies. With the annotated sequences in CoVDB, more specific blast search results can be generated for efficient downstream analysis.","Coronaviruses are found in a wide variety of animals and are associated with respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity. Based on genotypic and serological characterization, coronaviruses were divided into three distinct groups (1) (2) (3) . As a result of the unique mechanism of viral replication, coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination (2, 4) ."

& Carbohydrates On-Chip Screening of aG lycomimetic Library with C-Type Lectins Reveals Structural Features Responsible for Preferential Binding of Dectin-2 overD C-SIGN/R and Langerin,"Al ibrary of mannose-and fucose-based glycomimetics was synthesizeda nd screened in am icroarray format againstaset of C-typel ectin receptors (CLRs) that included DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, langerin, andd ectin-2. Glycomimetic li-gandsa ble to interact with dectin-2w ere identified for the first time. Comparative analysiso fb inding profiles allowed their selectivity against other CLRs to be probed.","Lectins are sugar-bindingp roteins that engage in interactions with endogenousa nd exogenousg lycans. The interactions between lectins and carbohydratesa re involved in many fundamental biological events, from cell adhesiont oa ntigen recognition and internalization, inflammation, or quality control in protein folding. The most abundant class of animal lectins are the C-typel ectin receptors (CLRs) serving ab road range of functions. They are involved in pathogen recognition and in prevention of autoimmunity by contributing to the immune system's ability to identify carbohydrate-based pathogen-asso-ciated molecular patterns (PAMP) and damaged-self-associated molecular patterns (DAMP).They take part in signal transduction, cell trafficking, and in the induction of T-cell differentiation. Their name,C -type lectins, indicates the presence of a Ca 2 + ion in their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). This ion is the primary site of carbohydrate interaction and typically coordinates two vicinal hydroxyl groups on as ugar ring. Many C-typel ectin receptors arey et to be exploreda nd described in detailw ith regard to their CRD structure, carbohydrate binding specificities, and the molecular factors governing the interaction with glycans. However,i ti sk nown that the CRDs of CLRs feature evolutionarily conserved groups of residues that coordinatet he Ca 2 + ion and determine the monosaccharide binding specificity of the CLR.S o, aG lu-Pro-Asn (EPN) motif results in ap reference for mannose( Man), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), fucose (Fuc), or glucose (Glc) residues,w hereas a Gln-Pro-Asp (QPD) sequence leads to recognition of galactose (Gal) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). [1] Available data also suggestst hat the extended binding sites of CLRs often display ah igher affinity towardsl arger glycans tructures, thanks to additional interactions occurring in the vicinity of the primary Ca 2 + site. [2] Thus, complex glycanse xposing the same monosaccharide can bind to CLRs with very different affinities, depending on the accessibility of the recognition elementa nd on additional features of the lectin bindings ites. Structural studiesa lso demonstrate that secondary binding sites can alter the affinity and specificity of the CLR towardsl igands. As an example, langerin, [3] at ransmembrane CLR expressedo nL angerhans-cells, and the dendritic-cell specific intercellulara dhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), aC LR expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) [4] shares imilar primary binding sites with similars pecificity for oligomannosides, but langerin has an additional calcium-independent sugar-binding site and binds to large sulfatedg lycosamino glycans, whereas DC-SIGN does not. [5] Given the key role played by lectins in biological systems, many research groups have turned their attention towards the development of glycomimetic molecules to be used as selective probesf or the study of sugar-protein interactions and/or for medicinal chemistryp urposes. [6] Glycomimetics present several advantages as drug candidates over natural glycans, since they can be made metabolically more stable, more bioavailable, and possibly morea ctive and selectivethan natural oligosaccharides. Our previous studies have focused on inhibiting the dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN, aC LR implicated in viral and bacterial infections. [7] The primary binding site of DC-SIGN CRD recognizes mannoseo ligosaccharides, l-fucose residues in Lewis-type blood antigens, [4] and biantennary N-glycans with terminal GlcNAcm oieties. [8] Additional druggable sites on the lectin have been described recently. [9] DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion to dendritic cells is the first step of severalv iral infections, notably by HIV and Ebola viruses. [10] Glycomimetic antagonists of DC-SIGN have mainly been designed startingf rom high mannoseg lycans, like Man 9 (Man) 9 (GlcNAc) 2 (1,F igure 1), or from Le X (Fuca1,3-(Galb1,4-)-GlcNAc) (2)-type structures. In particular,p seudo-di and tri-mannoside fragments (3-6)w ere synthesized [11] as mimics of the D2 and D3 arms of Man 9 ( Figure 1 ). When used in multivalent constructs, they were found to block DC-SIGN-mediatedi nfection with activities up to the nanomolar level both in HIV and Ebola infection models. [12] Notably,t he bisbenzylamide derivatives 6a [11c] and 6b [11d] also exhibited strong selectivity towards DC-SIGNa nd did not bind to langerin, aCLR that shares with DC-SIGN asimilar set of ligandsbut, rather than spreading the infection,f acilitates HIV eradication. [13] These results suggested that, with appropriate modifications, the structure of 6 could represent a general template to generate ad iverse library of glycomimetics containing one natural monosaccharide as the lectin-targeting element andatuning unit, which could providea dditional functional elements for interaction witht he lectin in the proximity of the primary binding site. As mentioned above, the structure of 6 derives from mimicryo ft he Mana1-2Man disaccharide, the terminal unit of the D1-D3a rms of Man 9 and a common disaccharide ligand for DC-SIGN (PDB:2 IT6) and for other CLRs of the immune system with similar specificity,s uch as DC-SIGNR, [14] langerin (PDB:3 P5F), [15] and dectin-2 (PDB: 5VYB).

,"Purpose: Several markers for eosinophilic inflammation have been proposed to predict response to asthma treatment. However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions have not yet been established. We investigate a potentially useful relatively non-invasive biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), to predict favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast, common treatment for children with asthma. Methods: Young children (1 to 6 years old) were enrolled in this randomized, parallel, 2-group, open-label trial. Criteria for eligibility included: 1) being symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) having a serum EDN (sEDN) level ≥ 53 ng/mL, with positive specific immunoglobulin E to house dust mite. Eligible patients were randomly placed into 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily; the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily. Ineligible patients were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily (OBS group). Treatment period was 12 weeks. Results: Asthma control days increased significantly in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000) over the 12-week study period. There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group but there was a significant decrease in the MONT group (P < 0.000). Patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels (> 53 ng/mL) showed a significant decrease due to MONT treatment (P = 0.023). Rescue medication usage significantly decreased in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000). Conclusions: EDN is a useful relatively non-invasive biomarker for predicting responses to montelukast and budesonide treatment of preschool children with beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze (Trial registry at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000008335).","Chronic airway inflammation is a hallmark of asthma 1 ; consequently, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the main treatment. 2 Although leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) also have anti-inflammatory properties 3 and are often administered, especially to young children, guidelines clearly state ICSs are the preferred option for long-term control of asthma. 2 This preference is based mainly on evidence from clinical trials comparing mean responses between treatment and control groups. However, other trials have demonstrated that there is considerable inter-individual variability in treatment response to ICSs versus LTRAs. [4] [5] [6] It is important for a clinician to collect information that better guides them in selecting medication most likely to achieve a favorable response in each patient (i.e., tailor-made treatment regimens)."

The imperative to develop a human vaccine for the Hendra virus in Australia,"The Hendra virus (HeV) poses a significant challenge to public health in Australia. Expanding migratory patterns observed among bats and the mutation of the virus to seek and successfully infect new hosts is a significant departure from the generalized epidemiological trend. The recent discovery of equine-related infections and deaths in addition to a canine infection demonstrates the inadequacy of the current equine vaccine developed in 2012. Traditional models for controlling the spread of the vector are futile given the rapid pace at which bats' habitats are eroded. Recent ongoing zoonotic epidemics, for example, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, demonstrate that human-to-human transmission is a distinct reality rather than an obscure possibility. The development of a human HeV vaccine is essential for the biosecurity of Australia, as part of a multipronged strategy to control HeV in Australia.","T he Hendra virus (HeV) is an emerging zoonotic infection in Queensland, Australia (1Á3). First identified in 1994, it is associated with a human fatality rate of 60% (4) . Traditionally infecting fruit bats, recent host amplification of HeV in infected equines is purported to underlie the spate of fatal outbreaks of HeV infection among exposed humans in Queensland, Australia (5). To prevent further outbreaks, Biosecurity Australia (the chief health surveillance agency in Australia) commissioned the successful and rapid development of an equine vaccine against HeV to preclude the incidence of additional human cases (6) ."
ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 induces innate immune responses in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages,"Avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause lifelong infection and can escape from the host immune defenses in chickens. Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1β (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-β (IFN-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.","Avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an alpharetrovirus that causes immunosuppression and can induce tumors in infected chickens (Payne and Nair, 2012) . There is no available vaccine to prevent ALV-J infection and new virus strains are often isolated in China and other parts of the world (Dong et al., 2015; Malhotra et al., 2015) . ALV-J has an uncertain length of latency and replicates at variable rates during the course of a persistent, lifelong infection. Previ-C The Author 2016.

Endogenous ribosomal frameshift signals operate as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast,"Although first discovered in viruses, previous studies have identified operational À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 RF) signals in eukaryotic genomic sequences, and suggested a role in mRNA stability. Here, four yeast À1 RF signals are shown to promote significant mRNA destabilization through the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD), and genetic evidence is presented suggesting that they may also operate through the no-go decay pathway (NGD) as well. Yeast EST2 mRNA is highly unstable and contains up to five À1 RF signals. Ablation of the À1 RF signals or of NMD stabilizes this mRNA, and changes in À1 RF efficiency have opposing effects on the steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA. These results demonstrate that endogenous À1 RF signals function as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast. Consistent with current evolutionary theory, phylogenetic analyses suggest that À1 RF signals are rapidly evolving cis-acting regulatory elements. Identification of high confidence À1 RF signals in $10% of genes in all eukaryotic genomes surveyed suggests that À1 RF is a broadly used post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression.","Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is has historically been associated with the study of viruses. PRF signals stochastically redirect ribosomes into new reading frames and viral PRF promotes synthesis of C-terminally extended fusion proteins. The most well defined PRF signals direct ribosomes to slip by one nucleotide in the 5 0 (À1) direction. À1 PRF signals typically contain three elements: a 'slippery site' composed of seven nucleotides (X XXY YYZ, incoming zero-frame indicated by spaces) where shifting occurs; a short spacer sequence and a downstream stimulatory structure, typically an mRNA pseudoknot (1) (2) (3) . Current models posit that the pseudoknot directs ribosomes to pause with their aminoacyl-(aa-) and peptidyl-tRNAs positioned over the slippery sequence, where re-pairing of the non-wobble bases of both tRNAs with the À1 frame codons occurs (4) (5) (6) (7) ."
Development of a novel detection system for microbes from bovine diarrhea by real-time PCR,"Diarrhea in cattle is one of the most economically costly disorders, decreasing milk production and weight gain. In the present study, we established a novel simultaneous detection system using TaqMan real-time PCR designed as a system for detection of microbes from bovine diarrhea using real-time PCR (referred to as Dembo-PCR). Dembo-PCR simultaneously detects a total of 19 diarrhea-causing pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Specific primer-probe sets were newly designed for 7 pathogens and were synthesized on the basis of previous reports for 12 pathogens. Assays were optimized to react under the same reaction conditions. The PCR efficiency and correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of standard curves for each assay were more than 80% and 0.9766, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of Dembo-PCR in fecal sample analysis was measured with feces spiked with target pathogens or synthesized DNA that included specific nucleotide target regions. The resulting limits of detection (LOD) for virus-spiked samples, bacteria and DNA fragments were 0.16-1.6 TCID 50 (PFU/reaction), 1.3-13 CFU/reaction and 10-100 copies/reaction, respectively. All reactions showed high sensitivity in pathogen detection. A total of 8 fecal samples, collected from 6 diarrheic cattle, 1 diarrheic calf and 1 healthy cow, were tested using Dembo-PCR to validate the assay's clinical performance. The results revealed that bovine coronavirus had infected all diarrheic adult cattle and that bovine torovirus had infected the diarrheic calf. These results suggest that Dembo-PCR may be a powerful tool for diagnosing infectious agents in cattle diarrhea.","Diarrhea in cattle is a disorder that causes economic loss by decreasing fertility and productivity, including milk production and weight gain [11, 20] . In particular, young calves are strongly affected by diarrhea and may die from malnutrition and dehydration depending on the situations [25] . The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that 57% of deaths of weaning calves in the US were because of diarrhea (http:// nahms.aphis.usda.gov/dairy/index.htm). Although the cattle industry has taken measures to prevent diarrhea, such as improvements in hygiene and feeding management, it still occurs throughout the world [5] ."
Estimation of the reproductive number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: A data-driven analysis,"Backgrounds: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied ""earlyR"" package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied ""projections"" package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. Conclusion: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.","A novel coronavirus , which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to 25 countries worldwide. Up to February 16, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases were 70548 in China (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020) and 683 in other countries (World Health Organization, 2020) . The whole world, especially China, has taken extraordinary measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, and the effects were already present."
Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis,Introduction: The aim of the study was to demonstrate Interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions. Material and methods: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using realtime quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months' treatment course. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. Results: Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and P = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and P = 0.001). Conclusions: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept which views psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition which is the result of persistent stimulation of T cells by antigens of epidermal origin [1] . This persistent stimulation of T cells is the result of an interaction between T cells, antigen-presenting cells, i.e. Langerhans cells, and antigens, and comprises the following steps: primary signals (signal 1) including T-cell receptor stimulation by peptide antigen, co-stimulation (so-called accessory signals) (signal 2), and T helper type 1 (Th 1) differentiation and proliferation [2] ."
Specific Plasma Autoantibody Reactivity in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,"Increased autoantibody reactivity in plasma from Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) patients may provide novel disease signatures, and possible early detection. In a two-stage study we investigated Immunoglobulin G reactivity in plasma from MDS, Acute Myeloid Leukemia post MDS patients, and a healthy cohort. In exploratory Stage I we utilized high-throughput protein arrays to identify 35 high-interest proteins showing increased reactivity in patient subgroups compared to healthy controls. In validation Stage II we designed new arrays focusing on 25 of the proteins identified in Stage I and expanded the initial cohort. We validated increased antibody reactivity against AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B in patients, which enabled sample classification into stable MDS and healthy individuals. We also detected elevated AKT3 protein levels in MDS patient plasma. The discovery of increased specific autoantibody reactivity in MDS patients, provides molecular signatures for classification, supplementing existing risk categorizations, and may enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for MDS.","M yelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) encompass a diverse range of hematological disorders, with variable clinical outcomes resulting from individual patients' clinical and biological features 1, 2 . MDS pathogenesis involves multifaceted factors, related to intrinsic hematopoietic precursor cell abnormalities. The prevalent shared pathogenesis causing the ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS involves varying degrees of apoptosis of the hematopoietic cell linage [3] [4] [5] . Recent genomic approaches have concentrated on the effects of specific gene mutations and their associated signaling pathways, and their role in MDS development and outcome, including the tendency of transitioning to more aggressive disease stages 6, 7 . Currently, the prognosis of patient outcomes is greatly facilitated by the establishment of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS 8 , recently revised as IPSS-R 9 ). The IPSS takes into account multiple clinical markers to classify lower risk patients (Low, Intermediate 1) as having improved prognoses compared to those with higher risk features (Intermediate 2 and High)."

Iranian Emergency Medical Service Response in Disaster; Report of three Earthquakes,"Introduction: The earthquake is one of the most natural catastrophic crises that can cause a lot of casualties. Considering an earthquake-prone country, Iran is ranked as one of the world's most dangerous countries Objective: In this article, we describe the actions taken by emergency medical service (EMS) after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Bam and compared the strengths and weaknesses of the emergency response program and the limitations and challenges of this system in dealing with these major crises. Method: This study is a cross-sectional study that compares some of the information and findings related to three earthquakes that occurred in Iran, including Bam, Varzaghan and Sarpol-e-Zahab earthquakes. The data reported in the present article is descriptive and is based on various independent sources such as National Emergency Operation Center, Local Emergency Operations Center (EOC), the EMS of the country, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the statistics website, the Forensic Data website, the International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering, conferences and personal interviews. To ensure the credibility of the information, the authors reported data that had been verified by two or more sources. Results: The characteristics of the geographic area of the 3 earthquakes has been described. Post-earthquake response activities were described in details in subheadings including rapid warning and response, surge capacity plan, rapid response teams, emergency medical teams, increasing the capacity of health facilities, increasing transfer capacity, and handling, transportation and distribution of injuries. Conclusion: In the recent earthquake, had been occurred in Sarpol-e-Zahab, the health response of the country was largely satisfactory. The existence of structures such as EOC at various levels, the unified incident command system, emergency operations plan, and Medical Care Monitoring Center are among the most important reasons for satisfactory performance.

Adv J Emerg Med. 2019;3(2): e13.","Over the past 10 years, natural disasters have killed 760000 people, injured 2 million people and affected more than 2 billion people worldwide (1) . The earthquake is one of the most natural catastrophic crises that can cause a lot of casualties (2) . Considering an earthquake-prone country, Iran is ranked as one of the world's most dangerous countries. The occurrence of 23 earthquakes with an intensity of more than 5 magnitudes has been recorded in Iran since 2000 (3, 4) . In the past, Iran has experienced several earthquakes in different areas, causing severe economic damage and heavy casualties, and the record number of people killed in the earthquakes in the last century has been over 73,000, which the actual number is likely to be more than that (5) (6) (7) . After an earthquake, various components of the health system and treatment centers are encountered with a large number of patients (2) . Emergency medical service (EMS) is an important component of the health care system in this situation (8) . The main goal of EMS in responding to a crisis is coordination and management of the health system services, as well as the continuation of medical services through triage, life-saving activities on the scene, rapid diagnosis and treatment, or the transfer of the injured to emergency departments (9) . It has been proven that timely emergency services will improve the outcome of patients, especially the time-sensitive ones (10) . Although there is a structured approach to the response of the EMS system to crises, recent studies indicate that more activities are still needed to improve (11, 12) . One of the last earthquakes recorded in Iran occurred on November 12, 2017, near the town of Sarpol-e-Zahab, Kermanshah province. Iranian Seismological Center reported this earthquake 7.3 magnitudes and a depth of 18.1 kilometers. The earthquake had three foreshocks: 1.9, 2.3, and 4.4 magnitudes one hour before the main earthquake and hundreds of aftershocks. This big event was felt across a large area in all directions with a maximum intensity in the eight focal areas of the earthquake. According to the statistics, 620 people lost their lives and thousands of structures suffered serious damage, and the two major cities of Ezgeleh (10 km north of the earthquake center) and Sarpol-e-Zahab (36 km south-east of the earthquake center) collapsed completely. Despite the great challenges that existed in responding to this major crisis, the responses of local and national organizations to address this crisis were significant, and the EMS as the first responder in the health system was responsible for coordinating and managing health services in this incident. Earlier, other earthquakes like the one occurred in Bam of magnitude 6.6 in 2003, as well as in Varzaghan of magnitude 3.6 in 2012, resulted in significant casualties. The experience of large events can have a positive impact on the awareness of organizations and direct their policies to the conduct of incident management activities (13) . In this article, we describe the actions taken by EMS after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Bam and compared the strengths and weaknesses of the emergency response program and the limitations and challenges of this system in dealing with these major crises."

Mutation of the S and 3c genes in genomes of feline coronaviruses,"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is classified into two biotypes based on its pathogenicity in cats: a feline enteric coronavirus of low pathogenicity and a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus. It has been suspected that FCoV alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome. The S and 3c genes of FCoV have been considered the candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion. In the present study, FCoVs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the S and 3c genes from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces, effusions, and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals. Our results indicated that approximately 95% FCoVs in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes. However, 80% FCoVs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the S and 3c genes with remainder displaying a mutation in the S or 3c gene. It was also suggested that mutational analysis of the 3c gene could be useful for studying the horizontal transmission of FCoVs in multi-cat environments.","same owner and referred to a veterinary hospital.

Mental health of nurses after the Fukushima complex disaster: a narrative review,"Work-related mental health impairment is recognized as a real problem in the context of helping responders, including health professionals, due to adverse health outcomes after a severe disaster. The Great East-Japan Earthquake, which occurred on 11 March 2011, was an unprecedented complex disaster that caused a nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). In addition to disaster stress and daily work, medical and health-care professionals, particularly nurses, provided counseling services to residents concerned about radiation health risks or mental health issues. This review focuses on the psychological aspects of the complex nuclear disaster, which was a combined artificial nuclear accident and natural disaster, and we investigated the psychological effects on hospital nurses associated with their experiences during the disaster. We looked at several investigations into the mental health of nurses after a nuclear disaster and in other situations. It was shown that mental health of nurses is impacted, not only after nuclear disasters but also in other circumstances. Furthermore, we noted the effects of extended periods of a heavy workload and daily life. Regarding anxiety about radiation exposure, nurses who had more knowledge of radiation tended to have better mental health, suggesting that education about the health risks of radiation exposure is important for health-care professionals. In summary, it is essential that nurses are provided with education about radiation exposure and its associated health risks, and also that there is a comprehensive approach to mental health care for nurses during the chronic phase of a disaster.","Exposure to disasters is common worldwide, and individuals severely exposed to disasters, particularly artificial disasters, may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental disorders [1, 2] . Certain occupational factors and certain disaster characteristics are strongly associated with psychological distress among disaster responders [3] [4] [5] . The Great East-Japan Earthquake, accompanied by a huge Tsunami on 11 March 2011, was an unprecedented complex disaster that caused more than 18 000 deaths and missing people and was followed by the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP [6] . The nuclear accident had a large negative impact, and rebuilding of the community of Fukushima has been notably slow over the past 6 years. Although it has been reported that the level of additional external and internal radiation exposure from this nuclear accident was much lower than the minimum dose level that causes direct negative health effects [7] ,the residents' anxiety regarding radiation exposure and health risks is yet to be resolved [5] . A survey of public perception of radiation in Fukushima city conducted in May 2014 revealed that 70-80% of residents had experienced anxiety regarding the health risks of radiation exposure to themselves or their families following the nuclear accident [8] . It has been documented that the Three Mile Island NPP accident in the USA in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the former Soviet Union in 1986 significantly influenced the residents mentally [9] . The decommissioning work at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP is expected to continue for a long time, and, as for the Three Mile Island and the Chernobyl accidents, health-care workers, especially public health nurses and hospital nurses, are often asked by the residents about the health risks of the radiation exposure after the disaster [10] . At the same time, the health-care workers are also residents who have their own concerns regarding radiation exposure and the health risks to themselves and their families, which tends to be a mental burden for them. Although the role of nurses in providing mental health care for disaster victims has been extensively studied, the mental health of the nurses themselves in a disaster area has not been sufficiently considered [11] [12] [13] . As shown in Table 1 , there are a few studies focusing on the mental health of nurses in disaster zones [3, [13] [14] [15] . In this review, we looked at the factors affecting mental health and the narrative stories describing resilience in nurses working in the face of disaster, also reviewing the mental health-related findings for residents who experienced the Fukushima disaster or similar disasters, such as atomic bomb."
"R E V I E W Functional aspects, phenotypic heterogeneity, and tissue immune response of macrophages in infectious diseases","Macrophages are a functionally heterogeneous group of cells with specialized functions depending not only on their subgroup but also on the function of the organ or tissue in which the cells are located. The concept of macrophage phenotypic heterogeneity has been investigated since the 1980s, and more recent studies have identified a diverse spectrum of phenotypic subpopulations. Several types of macrophages play a central role in the response to infectious agents and, along with other components of the immune system, determine the clinical outcome of major infectious diseases. Here, we review the functions of various macrophage phenotypic subpopulations, the concept of macrophage polarization, and the influence of these cells on the evolution of infections. In addition, we emphasize their role in the immune response in vivo and in situ, as well as the molecular effectors and signaling mechanisms used by these cells. Furthermore, we highlight the mechanisms of immune evasion triggered by infectious agents to counter the actions of macrophages and their consequences. Our aim here is to provide an overview of the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of critical transmissible diseases and discuss how elucidation of this relationship could enhance our understanding of the host-pathogen association in organ-specific immune responses.","The primary function of the immune system has traditionally been defined as protection against microorganisms, although it plays an equally crucial role in protecting the host against invasion by foreign agents and eliminating affected cells that might compromise organic homeostasis. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The immune system functions through mechanisms involving both humoral and cellular immunity, which generally act in the early and late inborn phases of the response to antigens, respectively. [2] [3] [4] [5] In this context, the concept of organ-specific tissue immunity, which is related to the functional specificity of each organ mostly arose from the research of Engwerda and Kaye. 1 Particularly, in their study in 2000, the authors discussed the immunological mechanisms triggered in response to hepatic infection by parasites of the genus Leishmania. 1 This work helped focus attention on the concept of tissue immunity and prompted investigations into its mechanisms in various organs because of the close relationship between the induction routes of the cellular lesions involved in distinct organs in infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic diseases. 1 the skin, macrophages might be present as Langerhans cells or histiocytes, which primarily function in phagocytosis as well as antigen capture, processing, and presentation. 13, [21] [22] [23] [31] [32] [33] "
"Caspase cleavage of viral proteins, another way for viruses to make the best of apoptosis","Viral infection constitutes an unwanted intrusion that needs to be eradicated by host cells. On one hand, one of the first protective barriers set up to prevent viral replication, spread or persistence involves the induction of apoptotic cell death that aims to limit the availability of the cellular components for viral amplification. On the other hand, while they completely depend on the host molecular machinery, viruses also need to evade the cellular responses that are meant to destroy them. The existence of numerous antiapoptotic products within the viral kingdom proves that apoptosis constitutes a major threat that should better be bypassed. Among the different strategies developed to deal with apoptosis, one is based on what viruses do best: backfiring the cell on itself. Several unrelated viruses have been described to take advantage of apoptosis induction by expressing proteins targeted by caspases, the key effectors of apoptotic cell death. Caspase cleavage of these proteins results in various consequences, from logical apoptosis inhibition to more surprising enhancement or attenuation of viral replication. The present review aims at discussing the characterization and relevance of this post-translational modification that adds a new complexity in the already intricate host-apoptosis-virus triangle.","When a viral infection threatens cells, one of the first measures they take is to induce apoptosis to restrict viral replication and spread. [1] [2] [3] Dying this way, host cells are likely to generate specific signals aiming at triggering the immune system with innate and/or adaptative responses allowing the eradication of the invader. 4, 5 On the other hand, viruses have evolved a huge arsenal of strategies meant to either counteract or deal with this destructive process to ensure their survival. [6] [7] [8] Apoptotic cell death is accompanied by characteristic morphological changes (cellular rounding-up and volume reduction, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbingy) and at a molecular level by the activation of first initiator and then effector cysteinyl aspartate proteinases or caspases. 9,10 Activated caspases act through a catalytic Cys that hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the substrate, with a stringent specificity for Asp residue at P1 position (the nature of residues at positions P2, P3 and P4 depending on the caspase). Caspase substrates include a large number and variety of cellular proteins that participate through their cleavage to the strong apoptosisrelated morphological changes, as well as other physiological processes. Interestingly, viral proteins are also likely to be cleaved by caspases but until 2004, only four of them were reported as such and suggested as advantaging the associated viruses through their cleavage. 11 Since, their number has greatly increased and at least 16 viruses are now known to express proteins that undergo caspase cleavage. Here, we aim at updating these cleavages and discussing their biological relevance. From apoptosis inhibition to the improvement or attenuation of viral amplification, caspase cleavage of VPs highlights a potential new fascinating viral strategy to handle apoptosis induction."
"Coronaviruses induce entry-independent, continuous macropinocytosis","Macropinocytosis is exploited by many pathogens for entry into cells. Coronaviruses (CoVs) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV are important human pathogens; however, macropinocytosis during CoV infection has not been investigated. We demonstrate that the CoVs SARS CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) induce macropinocytosis, which occurs late during infection, is continuous, and is not associated with virus entry.","ratory infections (1) , have demonstrated the capacity to cause severe and deadly zoonotic diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2, 3) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (4). However, virus-host interactions that allow for CoV adaptation and survival are not well understood. CoVs are a family of enveloped RNA viruses with large positive-strand genomes of 26 to 32 kb (5) . The CoV life cycle is initiated by binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to a cellular receptor, followed by entry by direct fusion at the plasma membrane or by endosomal uptake (6) . CoV replicase proteins extensively modify intracellular membranes to form sites of viral RNA synthesis, followed by virus assembly and maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), with release by nonlytic secretory mechanisms (5, 7, 8) ."
Direct visualization of Ebola virus fusion triggering in the endocytic pathway,"Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion-triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing-by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7 ؉ ) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.","occurs primarily through a macropinocytosis-like process, and the virus traffics through the endocytic pathway (16) (17) (18) . Proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by a class of low-pH-activated proteases, cysteine cathepsins, removes the C-terminal glycan cap and mucin domain sequences (19) to reveal a receptor-binding domain. This newly exposed GP1 domain interacts with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which serves as an obligate intracellular receptor for filoviruses (20, 21) . While cathepsin cleavage and subsequent NPC1 binding are indispensable for infection, they are themselves insufficient to mediate release of the viral genome to the cytoplasm (22) . A final trigger for fusion of viral and endosomal membranes by GP2 has been postulated but not demonstrated (23, 24) , and which precise endosomal compartment actually supports fusion is unknown."
Structural complexity of Dengue virus untranslated regions: cis-acting RNA motifs and pseudoknot interactions modulating functionality of the viral genome,"The Dengue virus (DENV) genome contains multiple cis-acting elements required for translation and replication. Previous studies indicated that a 719-nt subgenomic minigenome (DENV-MINI) is an efficient template for translation and (À) strand RNA synthesis in vitro. We performed a detailed structural analysis of DENV-MINI RNA, combining chemical acylation techniques, Pb 2+ ion-induced hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight protein-independent 5 0 -3 0 terminal interactions involving hybridization between recognized cisacting motifs. Probing analyses identified tandem dumbbell structures (DBs) within the 3 0 terminus spaced by single-stranded regions, internal loops and hairpins with embedded GNRA-like motifs. Analysis of conserved motifs and top loops (TLs) of these dumbbells, and their proposed interactions with downstream pseudoknot (PK) regions, predicted an H-type pseudoknot involving TL1 of the 5 0 DB and the complementary region, PK2. As disrupting the TL1/PK2 interaction, via 'flipping' mutations of PK2, previously attenuated DENV replication, this pseudoknot may participate in regulation of RNA synthesis. Computer modeling implied that this motif might function as autonomous structural/regulatory element. In addition, our studies targeting elements of the 3 0 DB and its complementary region PK1 indicated that communication between 5 0 -3 0 terminal regions strongly depends on structure and sequence composition of the 5 0 cyclization region.","Unlike cellular mRNAs, which only contain translational regulatory motifs, viral RNA genomes have evolved functional regions, which act at different stages of their life cycle. These specific structures, their interactions and association with host proteins and ligands, together orchestrate the multifunctionality of viral RNA genomes. Often, RNA-RNA interactions spanning significant distances (1,2) bring regulatory motifs into proximity, changing our view of a functional viral RNA genome from that of a linear molecule to one whose 3D structure is an important contributor during the life cycle (3, 4) ."
"Reply to ""Statins may decrease the Fatality Rate of MERS Infection""","Citation Totura AL, Baric RS. 2015. Reply to ""Statins may decrease the fatality rate of MERS infection."" mBio 6(5):e01303-15.","S ince the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, there has been a steady stream of MERS cases geographically focused in the Middle East, indicating that either zoonotic transmission from camel to human or person-to-person transmission likely takes place on a frequent basis (1) . As reaffirmed by the recent MERS outbreak in South Korea, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are capable of causing epidemics affecting hundreds of individuals as a result of sustained person-to-person transmission in nosocomial settings that can be linked to a single traveler who became an index patient (2) . Currently, the best public health strategy to circumvent sustained coronavirus transmission in an outbreak situation is to quarantine individuals who have a history of contact with confirmed cases of MERS. In the most recent outbreak in South Korea, this led to the isolation and monitoring of more than 16,000 individuals, a feat that may not be economically or logistically feasible in future outbreaks (2) . Due to the diversity and presence of prepandemic zoonotic coronaviruses in bat populations, we may expect the continual reemergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses related to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), or other CoV strains to be a future risk to global public health (3, 4) . There is clearly a need for coronavirus-specific medical countermeasure strategies against these respiratory pathogens, as studies indicate that general antiviral medications like interferon and ribavirin are ineffective in MERS or SARS patients (5, 6) ."
Primary Sequence Domains Required for the Retention of Rotavirus VP7 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum,"Rotavirus VP7 is a membrane-associated protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is the product of rotavirus gene 9 which potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids that contains two amino terminal hydrophobic domains, hl and h2, each preceded by an initiation codon. Comparison of the size of products derived from altered genes containing coding sequences for both hl and h2 with those lacking the hl sequence ('dhl' mutants), indicates that initiation takes place at M30 immediately preceding h2 (residues F32 to 1-,48) and that h2 is cleaved, confirming the studies of others (Stirzaker, S. C., P. L. Whitfeld, D. L. Christie, A. R. Bellamy, and G. W. Both. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:2897-2903). Our previous work had shown that deletions in the carboxy end of h2, extending to amino acid 61 in the open reading frame, resulted in secretion of VP7. The region from amino acid number 51-61, present in wild-type VP7 but missing in the secreted mutant A47-61, was thus implicated to have a role in ER retention. To test this, a series of chimeric genes were constructed by fusing the first 63 codons of wild-type VP7, Al-14 or A51-61/ dhl, to the mouse salivary ~t-amylase gene, a secretory protein, such that the fusion junction was located at the exact mature terminus of amylase. The chimeric proteins VP763/amylase, Al-14Jamylase and A51-6163/dhl/amylase were secreted when expressed in cells and the h2 domain was cleaved when mRNA was translated in vitro. These results imply that the sequence 51-61 is necessary but not sufficient for ER retention. When a second series of VP7/amylase chimera were constructed extending the VP7 contribution to amino acid 111, the product expressed by AI-14HI/ amylase was not secreted whereas that of A47-61 ttl/ amylase was. Significantly, the intracellular Al-14m/amylase product exhibited an amylase enzymatic specific activity that was similar to that of the wild-type amylase product. We conclude that two regions of VP7 mediate its retention in the ER, the first lies within the sequence 51-61 and the second within the sequence 62-111, which contains the glycosylation site for VP7. Both regions are necessary for retention, though neither is sufficient alone.","p ROTEINS are targeted to various intracellular organelles with a high degree of specificity determined in part by primary sequence information in proteins of mitochondria (32) , the nucleus (14) , or those translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ~ (3) . For several lumenal ER proteins, the sequence 'KDEL' at the carboxy terminus is necessary for their ER retention (4, 20, 24, 25) whereas ER specific retention sequence(s) have not been demonstrated for ER membrane-associated proteins. Viral protein expression systems have been useful for elucidating targeting behavior of proteins to the plasma membrane (1, 7, 9) or Golgi apparatus (21) . Rotavirus provides a similarly useful model system for investigating membrane-associated proteins targeted to the ER. During the maturation of rotavirus, virus cores assemble in cytoplasmic viroplasm structures, subsequently bud through the membranes of the rough ER or nuclear envelope and acquire a transient membrane envelope (8, 28, 29) . The mature double-capsid nonenveloped virions accumulate in the ER lumen. The structural glycoprotein and major neutralizing antigen VP7, is initially a membrane-associated protein with a lumenal orientation (13) . VP7 exhibits only a high-mannose tbrm of carbohydrate (13) consistent with its location solely in the ER (28, 29) . It is not known how VP7 assembles into virus particles nor by what mechanism the membrane elements are removed during virus maturation."
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-How Worried Should We Be? A NOVEL VIRUS IS IDENTIFIED IN SAUDI ARABIA,"Ten years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been identified as the cause of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travelers from this region. Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus. It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection. However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients. Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not. Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV ""a threat to the entire world."" This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered.","M iddle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially isolated in September 2012 from a patient in Saudi Arabia who had developed a lethal infection characterized by pneumonia and renal failure (1) . A nearly identical virus was then isolated from a second Saudi Arabian patient with respiratory disease who had been flown to London for therapy. In retrospect, the first cases of MERS occurred in an extended family in Zarqa, Jordan, in April 2012. Virus was detected in two patients in that outbreak, but several other family members and health care workers developed respiratory disease. Virus was not isolated from these individuals. Renal failure was noted in some of the early reports, but it is not yet clear whether it was virus induced or occurred as a consequence of respiratory failure. Since those early days, several other clusters of infection have been identified, indicating that human-to-human transmission occurred, although spread may not be efficient (2) . The incubation time for patients with confirmed disease was 5.2 days (confidence interval, 1.9 to 14.7 days), according to one study (3) ."
Structural and functional analyses reveal promiscuous and species specific use of ephrin receptors by Cedar virus,"Cedar virus (CedV) is a bat-borne henipavirus related to Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), zoonotic agents of fatal human disease. CedV receptor-binding protein (G) shares only ∼30% sequence identity with those of NiV and HeV, although they can all use ephrin-B2 as an entry receptor. We demonstrate that CedV also enters cells through additional B-and A-class ephrins (ephrin-B1, ephrin-A2, and ephrin-A5) and report the crystal structure of the CedV G ectodomain alone and in complex with ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2. The CedV G receptor-binding site is structurally distinct from other henipaviruses, underlying its capability to accommodate additional ephrin receptors. We also show that CedV can enter cells through mouse ephrin-A1 but not human ephrin-A1, which differ by 1 residue in the key contact region. This is evidence of species specific ephrin receptor usage by a henipavirus, and implicates additional ephrin receptors in potential zoonotic transmission.","totypical zoonotic henipaviruses, and they exhibit a broad mammalian host range with evidence of natural infection of humans, bats, horses, pigs, cattle, goats, and dogs as well as experimental infection of ferrets, hamsters, mice, cats, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates (1, 2) . HeV and NiV infection spillover events into domestic animals and humans cause severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease. These viruses are biosafety level-4-restricted pathogens (3) , and both NiV and HeV remain threats to economically important livestock throughout South Asia and Australia (4) . NiV and henipaviral diseases have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an epidemic threat needing urgent research and development action, and are included in the WHO R&D Blueprint list of priority pathogens with epidemic potential (5) . The genus Henipavirus also includes Cedar virus (CedV) and 2 candidate sequences, those of Ghana virus (GhV) and Mòji ang virus (MojV). CedV has several notable characteristics that separate it from HeV and NiV, including a nonpathogenic phenotype in mammalian disease models (6, 7) ."
Prevention of respiratory outbreaks in the rehabilitation setting,"Background Respiratory viral (RV) outbreaks in rehabilitation facilities can jeopardise patient safety, interfere with patient rehabilitation goals and cause unit closures that impede patient flow in referring facilities. Problem Despite education about infection prevention practices, frequent RV outbreaks were declared each year at our rehabilitation facility. Methods Before and after study design. The primary outcome was the number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days. Process measures included delays in initiation of transmission-based precautions, RV testing and reporting of staff to occupational health and safety (OHS). Balancing measures included the number of isolation days and staff missed work hours.","Nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses (RVs) can lead to unanticipated complications for patients during their contact with the healthcare system. In rehabilitation facilities, these outbreaks jeopardise patient safety, interfere with patient rehabilitation goals and cause unit closures that impede patient flow in referring facilities. 1 2 Multicomponent infection prevention and control (IPAC) strategies including hand hygiene, early symptom identification, transmission-based precautions, use of personal protective equipment by healthcare personnel and environmental cleaning, can be successful in preventing nosocomial transmission of RVs. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Despite this, adherence to these best practices is frequently suboptimal and RV outbreaks in healthcare remain a common yet preventable occurrence. At our rehabilitation institution in Toronto, Canada, we experienced frequent RV outbreaks every season despite continued efforts to educate healthcare providers about best IPAC practices."
"Influence of Breed Size, Age, Fecal Quality, and Enteropathogen Shedding on Fecal Calprotectin and Immunoglobulin A Concentrations in Puppies During the Weaning Period",Background: Fecal calprotectin and immunoglobulin A (IgA) are markers of intestinal inflammation and immunity in adult dogs.,"I n dogs, gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases are the third most frequent problem reported by owners in United States and Australia. 1 In the United Kingdom, a survey based on client questionnaires reported that up to 15% of dogs experienced mild diarrhea over a 2-week period. 2 Another study observed that, among sick animals presented for veterinary consultation, 7% of visits were related to diarrhea. 3 Diarrhea is even more frequent in young dogs <6 months of age than in adult dogs, with 25% of puppies having abnormal feces during the weaning period. 4, 5 Diarrhea during this period is a major problem as it can decrease daily weight gain and increase the risk of death. 6 As in other species, diarrhea is multifactorial, involving factors intrinsic to the dog (eg, breed size and age), nutritional factors (eg, diet change without transition, food type and quality), infectious diseases, and also lifestyle and environmental stressors. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Major enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in weanling puppies are canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2), 12 the Cystoisospora ohioensis-complex, Cystoisospora canis, 13 and Giardia duodenalis. 14 Co-infections by these enteropathogens are frequently reported in puppies. 4, 5 Several diagnostic tests (such as PCR, antigen testing by ELISA, and fecal examination) must be combined for accurate diagnosis in cases of diarrhea in weanling puppies. However, the use of such routine testing can be difficult and expensive."
-throughput Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Animal Specimens by Nanoscale PCR,"Nanoliter scale real-time PCR uses spatial multiplexing to allow multiple assays to be run in parallel on a single plate without the typical drawbacks of combining reactions together. We designed and evaluated a panel based on this principle to rapidly identify the presence of common disease agents in dogs and horses with acute respiratory illness. This manuscript describes a nanoscale diagnostic PCR workflow for sample preparation, amplification, and analysis of target pathogen sequences, focusing on procedures that are different from microliter scale reactions. In the respiratory panel presented, 18 assays were each set up in triplicate, accommodating up to 48 samples per plate. A universal extraction and pre-amplification workflow was optimized for high-throughput sample preparation to accommodate multiple matrices and DNA and RNA based pathogens. Representative data are presented for one RNA target (influenza A matrix) and one DNA target (equine herpesvirus 1). The ability to quickly and accurately test for a comprehensive, syndrome-based group of pathogens is a valuable tool for improving efficiency and ergonomics of diagnostic testing and for acute respiratory disease diagnosis and management.","With the demand for rapid and comprehensive detection of multiple agents in clinical diagnostics for humans and animals, single-organism molecular diagnostic methods for pathogen detection are burdensome unless used for large numbers of samples being tested for a single disease. In the veterinary context, high-throughput diagnostic methodologies are particularly important due to the additional need for covering pathogens from a wide variety of species. OneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include a number of bacteria, viruses (DNA or RNA based), parasites, and fungi. The challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together (multiplexing) in order to improve testing efficiency is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays."
H7N9 not only endanger human health but also hit stock marketing,Objective-This study aims to discuss the correlation between daily reported H7N9 cases and stock price indices in China.,"New or reemerging infectious diseases with the potential to cause severe epidemics or pandemics are increasingly prevalent [1, 2] . The emergence of new infectious diseases are not only a threaten to human health, but also cause large economic loss [3] . For example, according to Kumar, Fan and Melzer-Lange, in East and Southeast Asia under two SARS outbreaks, losses amounted to between US$12.3billion and US$28.4 billion [4] . The novel avian influenza A (H7N9), a new emergency infectious disease with a high fatality rate in humans [5] and initially reported in China in March, 2013 has had large economic impacts of H7N9 including over $6.5 billion lost in the agriculture sector due to changes in prices, consumer confidence and trade volumes [6] . The stock market is sensitive to economic indicators and is widely used as a proxy for economic performance [7] . Thus, huge economic losses attributed to H7N9 could be expected to be spontaneously reflected in stock markets in effects."

"Lack of detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in mild and severe respiratory infections in Catalonia, northeastern Spain","Surveillance of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was conducted to explore the possible introduction and circulation of this novel virus in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. Five hundred and sixty-three samples from mild and severe respiratory infections collected between January 2012 and April 2013 were screened using real-time RT-PCR. All samples were negative, suggesting that MERS-CoV is not circulating silently in Catalonia.","In June 2012, a patient with a severe respiratory infection was admitted to a hospital in Saudi Arabia. Known respiratory pathogens were ruled out as aetiological agents of the syndrome and the patient died of progressive respiratory and renal failure. Respiratory samples were further analysed, which resulted in the identification of a novel betacoronavirus: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1] . As of 12 September 2013, a total of 114 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 54 deaths, have been reported (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_09_07/en/ index.html). MERS-CoV is related to bat coronaviruses [2] , although the animal reservoir has not been identified and the virus has been only isolated in humans. The severity of the infections and the ability of the virus to be transmitted person to person [3, 4] raised international concerns about the possible spread and potential impact of the novel virus on human health. Asymptomatic or mild cases of MERS-CoV have been described [3, 5] , as well as cases of co-infection by MERS-CoV with other respiratory pathogens (http://www. who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_investi gation_guideline_Jul13.pdf). Two recent studies assessed the transmission potential of the virus by mathematical modelling using currently existing data. Although the estimation of the inter-human transmissibility suggests that the virus is currently unlikely to cause a pandemic [6] , it was also indicated that more than half of the symptomatic human cases would remain undetected [7] ."

Detection and Identification of Common Food-Borne Viruses with a Tiling Microarray,"Microarray hybridization based identification of viral genotypes is increasingly assuming importance due to outbreaks of multiple pathogenic viruses affecting humans causing wide-spread morbidity and mortality. Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment.","Food related illnesses in the world are currently estimated at 1.5 billion annually, including 76 million in the United States [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . About one-third of these cases are due to viruses and bacteria, the remainder are attributed to chemical toxins [1, 2] . Enteric viruses are the principal agents for outbreaks of food related illness outbreaks world-wide and are responsible for an estimated 40-50 million illnesses each year in the United States [3] [4] [5] . Particularly vulnerable populations are children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, particularly among an older population [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . About 40 million (80%) of the illnesses are due to food-borne viruses that include noroviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses, adenovirus (types 41 and 42), rotavirus, as well as other RNA viruses groups thus far surpassing food-borne illnesses due to non-viral microbial pathogens [2, 3] . Mortality rate due to food-borne bacterial pathogens, mainly enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella enteritidis are marginally higher [7] ."
Seasonal distribution of active systemic lupus erythematosus and its correlation with meteorological factors,OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of seasonal distribution of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the influences of meteorological factors including temperature and humidity on active systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) is a common autoimmune disease. The pathogenesis of SLE and the induced factors of active SLE are not completely clear, but it is generally considered that SLE is caused by both hereditary and environmental factors that ultimately lead to an abnormal immune response. Sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) rays have been considered to be the most important environmental factors in the induction of SLE. 1 Based on this, a high incidence of SLE should occur in summer and autumn when there is stronger sunlight and more intense UV rays. However, in clinical practice, we have found that more patients with SLE visit hospital at the end of autumn and at the end of winter, as well as at the beginning of winter and the beginning of spring, while in the summer and the autumn, less patients with SLE visit hospital. In order to confirm that high incidences of SLE should occur in summer and autumn when sunlight and UV rays are strong, we retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of seasonal distribution of active SLE and its correlation with meteorological factors in 640 patients, who live in the city of Zhanjiang, China and had active SLE between January 1997 and December 2006."

In a recent study of dogs with acute diarrhea in the United Kingdom, the most common treatments were dietary modification (66% of cases) and antimicrobial treatment (63% of cases). 1 Previous studies have reported that up to 71% of dogs with acute diarrhea are treated with antimicrobials 3 despite emerging evidence that antimicrobial treatment is not effective in dogs with hemorrhagic or uncomplicated acute diarrhea. 6, 7 Consequently, acute diarrhea represents a considerable portion of antimicrobial usage in veterinary practice."
"In Vitro Membrane Assembly of a Polytopic, Transmembrane Protein Results in an Enzymatically Active Conformation","In vitro integration of the polytopic, transmembrane lactose permease into membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli is demonstrated. To this end the enzyme was synthesized in a homologous, cell-free transcription-translation system. In this system, synthesis occurred in an essentially membrane-free environment leading to the formation of lactose permease aggregates, which were resistant to protease digestion and detergent solubilization. However, if inverted membrane vesicles from E. coli were included in the synthesis reaction, most de novo-synthesized lactose permease could be recovered from a membranecontaining subfraction (enriched in leader [signal] peptidase activity). This membrane association of lactose permease was Na2CO3 resistant, detergent sensitive, and yielded a distinct pattern of proteolytic cleavage peptides. Moreover, membrane vesicles when present cotranslationally during synthesis of lactose permease, acquired the capability to accumulate lactose, strongly suggesting a correct in vitro assembly of the enzyme.","Abstract.

Impact of Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak on the use of emergency medical resources in febrile patients,Objective Outbreaks of transmissible respiratory infection are suspected to have significant effects on the health of pediatric and geriatric patients. The objective was to assess the impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak on the use of emergency resources.,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by MERSassociated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a family of viruses that infect mammals such as camels, is an airborne disease. 1 The animal source and mode of transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is not well known. However, transmission is enhanced in the healthcare setting and 42% of all cases of transmission were found to be healthcare-associated. 2 An epidemic outbreak of MERS occurred in the Republic of Korea between May and July 2015, causing the second largest number of confirmed MERS cases since 2012, following the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 3 The outbreak of MERS in Korea can be characterized by intra-hospital transmission and hospital-to-hospital spread, due to easy hospital accessibility and the lack of restrictions on inter-hospital transfers or referrals. In most cases, transmission of MERS-CoV occurred in crowded tertiary emergency centers and due to vector patients moving across the country. 4 For several decades, emergency department (ED) crowding has been extensively discussed and various interventions to reduce the ED crowding were suggested. 5 Overcrowding in EDs occurs when the number of patients exceeds the physical or staffing capacity of the department. Overcrowding occurs in developed countries and has been well documented over the past decade. 6 Although the causative agent and mode of transmission of MERS have been examined in detail, the effects of the epidemic outbreak of an acute transmittable respiratory illness on the operation of the emergency services and the crowding of emergency centers have not been evaluated. We performed a large retrospective observational study comparing the demographic and What is already known It has been suggested that emergency department (ED) crowding is associated with adverse outcomes such as increased mortality rates. Previous studies have reported the adverse impact of Ebola on the health system in Sierra Leone, with a strong decrease in the use of healthcare facilities among pediatric and maternity patients. Preventive actions for increased uses of emergency resources such as pre-hospital emergency counseling service, diversion of ambulance transportation, and hospital admission, are needed promptly after disease outbreaks in the ED."

The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains remodel membranes in multiple cellular pathways. Based on studies of isolated BAR domains in vitro, the current paradigm is that BAR domain-containing proteins polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules. But in nature, proteins that contain BAR domains often also contain large intrinsically disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domain-containing proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data suggest that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is a key driver of membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain-containing proteins.","Cellular membranes must undergo dynamic remodeling to facilitate essential cellular processes, including formation of trafficking vesicles (Conner and Schmid, 2003) , viral egress (Hurley et al., 2010) , and cytokinesis (Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014) . Since membranes resist deformation (Helfrich, 1973) , cells employ specialized protein machines to drive membrane remodeling (Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006) . For example, the crescent-shaped, dimeric bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains Simunovic et al., 2015) polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces, forcing the underlying membrane to adopt the tubular geometry of the scaffold (Frost et al., 2008; Adam et al., 2015) . This rigid scaffold has been hypothesized to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing their division into separate membrane compartments through the process of membrane fission (Boucrot et al., 2012) . Notably, this perspective comes primarily from studies performed in vitro. In living cells, BAR scaffolds are thought to assemble into more limited scaffolds that shape membranes in concert with other proteins, including the dynamin fission machine and the actin cytoskeleton (Itoh et al., 2005; Ferguson et al., 2009; Renard et al., 2015) . Importantly, many in vitro studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed. Examples include the N-terminal amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin (Peter et al., 2004) , the FCH BAR (F-BAR) domain of FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2007 (Henne et al., , 2010 , the F-BAR domain of the neuronal migration protein srGAP2 (Guerrier et al., 2009) , the F-BAR domains of the cytokinesis proteins Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) and Cdc15 (McDonald et al., 2015) , and the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domains of MIM and ABBA (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ), among others. These results have provided critical insight into the detailed geometry of BAR domain arrangement at membrane surfaces, helping to elucidate their mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and induction. However, BAR domains do not typically exist in isolation in the cell, but rather as part of large, multi-domain proteins that also frequently contain long, intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domains of several hundred amino acids (Miele et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2007; Henne et al., 2010; Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) . How might these disordered domains influence the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains?"
"Drug Design, Development and Therapy Dovepress Design of an epitope-based peptide vaccine against spike protein of human coronavirus: an in silico approach","Human coronavirus (HCoV), a member of Coronaviridae family, is the causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections and ""atypical pneumonia"". Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions and lack of antiviral drug, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for HCoV. In this study, a computational approach was adopted to identify a multiepitope vaccine candidate against this virus that could be suitable to trigger a significant immune response. Sequences of the spike proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool, to identify the most immunogenic protein.","Human coronavirus (HCoV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family (alphacoronavirus 1) and comprises a large group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded polyadenylated RNA virus. 1, 2 It consists of the largest known viral RNA genomes, ranging from 27.6 to 31.6 kb. Usually, coronaviruses are classified into three groups (group I to III), based on their serological cross-reactivity. 3 Their classification is also supported by evolutionary analysis. 1 The group I viruses are animal pathogens, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. The group II viruses are responsible for domestic animal pathogenic infections, and the final group III viruses are responsible for avian species infection. 4 However both the group I and group II viruses are considered HCoV. The protein molecules that usually contribute the structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). HCoV is usually the causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections and also the causative agent of ""atypical pneumonia"", which was first identified in the People's Republic of China. 5 As nowadays, submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com"
Next-Generation Sequencing of Small RNAs from HIV-Infected Cells Identifies Phased microRNA Expression Patterns and Candidate Novel microRNAs Differentially Expressed upon Infection,"HIV infection of CD4 ؉ T cells induces a range of host transcriptional changes in mRNAs as well as microRNAs that may coordinate changes in mRNAs. To survey these dynamic changes, we applied next-generation sequencing, analyzing the small RNA fraction of HIV-infected cells at 5, 12, and 24 h postinfection (RNA-Seq). These time points afforded a view of the transcriptomic changes occurring both before and during viral replication. In the resulting small RNA-Seq data set, we detected a phased pattern of microRNA expression. Largely distinct sets of microRNAs were found to be suppressed at 5 and 12 h postinfection, and both sets of changes rebounded later in infection. A larger set of microRNA changes was observed at 24 h postinfection. When integrated with mRNA expression data, the small RNA-Seq data indicated a role for microRNAs in transcriptional regulation, T cell activation, and cell cycle during HIV infection. As a unique benefit of next-generation sequencing, we also detected candidate novel host microRNAs differentially expressed during infection, including one whose downregulation at 24 h postinfection may allow full replication of HIV to proceed. Collectively, our data provide a uniquely comprehensive view of the changes in host microRNAs induced by HIV during cellular infection.","During periods of active viral replication, these changes occur in multiple classes of molecules, including mRNAs and proteins (1, 2) . Infected cells exhibit decreased basic functionality, e.g., in cell signaling (3) , culminating in the eventual death of the cell. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we recently profiled the transcriptome of HIV-infected lymphoblastoid cells and found that over half of the detectable polyadenylated RNA species were differentially expressed (DE) during infection (1) . These changes corroborated clinical results. For example, in CD4 ϩ T cells isolated from HIV ϩ individuals, a distinct expression profile was observed comprising 260 genes whose expression correlated with viral load; these genes were involved in a variety of functions, including inflammatory signaling, cell cycle, and antigen presentation (4) ."
Electronic) A periodical of the Network for the Veterinarians of,"Objective: Parasitic infestation is a major cause of losses in livestock production in tropical regions. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Gastro-intestinal (GI) parasites of dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and fat-tailed sheep (dhumba), and the prevalence of hemoparasites in camel from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: A total of 87 fecal samples (32 dhumba and 55 camel) and 55 camel blood samples were collected during September-October 2015. Fecal samples were examined by direct smear, sedimentation method, flotation technique, and McMaster technique for GI parasite. Giemsa stained blood smears were examined under microscope for hemoparasite detection. Results: 62% camel (n = 34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 47.7-74.6) were infected with at least one genus of parasite. 15% camel were harboring more than one genus of parasite. The prevalence of GI parasite and hemoparasite in camel were recorded as Trichuris spp. (n = 16; 29%; 95% CI: 17.6-42.9), Balantidium coli (n = 12; 22%; 95% CI: 11.8-35.0), Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 7; 13%; 95% CI: 5.3-24.5), Strongyloides spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.0-20.0), Anaplasma spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.02-20.0), Paragonimus spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), Schistosoma spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), Hymenolepis spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), Moniezia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7), and Babesia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05-9.7). Mean EPG feces of camel was 291.76 ± 42.03 with a range of 0-1,400. Total 59.4% dhumba (n = 19; 95% CI: 41-76) were positive for GI parasite, including Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 10; 31.3%; 95% CI: 16.1-50), Strongyloides spp. (n = 9; 28%; 95% CI: 13.8-46.8), B. coli (n = 5; 15.6%; 95% CI: 5.3-32.8), and Trichuris spp. (n = 4; 12.5%; 95% CI: 3.5-28.9). Conclusions: High percentage of parasitic infestation in camel and dhumba in the present study refers to the necessity of use of anthelmintic for health and production improvement and to prevent zoonotic parasite transmission to animal handler and workers.","Single humped camel (Camelus dromedarius; Dromedary) and fat-tailed sheep (Dhumba) are well-known livestock species, reared mainly for meat or milk, skin, and wool. They are mostly reared in desert areas of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia [1] . 94% of the world's camel populations are found in the Horn region of Africa. Dhumba comprises 25% of the world's sheep population; some well-known dhumba breeds are Afrikaner, Damara, Persian Black Head, Tswana, Pedi, Sabi, Karakul, Awassi, Balkhi, etc [2] . Camel and dhumba are not usual animals for Bangladesh. But these species are of high economic value during religious festival in our country. Only one established camel farm is found in Bangladesh, which excels in camel farming as well as dhumba farming [3] . The farm was established with six imported camel from India in 2006. Since then, the farmer was able to do successful breeding of camel and the number of animal is increasing."
Viral Fitness Correlates with the Magnitude and Direction of the Perturbation Induced in the Host's Transcriptome: The Tobacco Etch Potyvirus-Tobacco Case Study,"Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a complex property that captures, in a single figure, differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. To what extent does viral fitness result from specific molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes in functional classes whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with the virus' fitness. Differentially expressed genes which were positively correlated with viral fitness activate hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. In contrast, those that were negatively correlated with fitness affect metabolism, reducing growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.","Fitness is a complex parameter often used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists to quantitatively describe the reproductive ability and evolutionary potential of an organism in a particular environment (Linnen and Hoekstra 2009; Orr 2009) . Despite this apparently simple definition, measuring fitness is difficult and most studies only measure one or more fitness components (e.g., survival to maturity, fecundity, number of mates, or number of offspring produced) as proxies to total fitness (Linnen and Hoekstra 2009; Orr 2009 ). In the field of virology, it has become standard to measure fitness by growth-competition experiments in mixed infections with a reference strain (Holland et al. 1991; Wargo and Kurath 2012) . With this experimental set up, fitness is just the relative ability of a viral strain to produce stable infectious progeny in a given host (cell type, organ, individual, or species) when resources have to be shared with a competitor (Domingo and Holland 1997) . Regardless its limitations, this approach provides a metric for ranking viral strains according to their performance in a particular environment/host. Such a fitness measure has been pivotal for quantitatively understanding many virus evolution processes: the effect of genetic bottlenecks and accumulation of deleterious mutations (Chao 1990; Duarte et al. 1992; De la Iglesia and Elena 2007) , the rates and dynamics of adaptive evolution into novel hosts , the pleiotropic cost of host range expansion (Novella, Clarke, et al. 1995; Turner and Elena 2000; Lali c et al. 2011) , the cost of genome complexity (Pesko et al. 2015; Willemsen et al. 2016) , the cost of antiviral escape mutations (Novella et al. 2005; Westerhout et al. 2005; Mart ınez-Picado and Mart ınez 2008) , the topography of adaptive fitness landscapes (Da Silva and Wyatt 2014; Lali c and Elena 2015; Cervera et al. 2016) , and the role of robustness in virus evolution (Codoñer et al. 2006; Sanju an et al. 2007; Novella et al. 2013) ."
Monitoring for airborne respiratory viruses in a general pediatric ward in Singapore,"There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that transmission of respiratory viruses occurs through the inhalation of virus-laden particles. Our study describes the use of an aerosol sampling system to monitor the prevalence of airborne viruses in a hospital setting. Using SKC AirCheck Touch pumps, with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) bioaerosol samplers and SKC filter cassette blanks, 28 aerosol samples were collected in a hospital ward in Singapore. Following DNA/RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR/PCR was used for the detection of influenza A, B and D viruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. Airborne virus was detected in nine (32%) of 28 samples. Among the nine positive samples, eight were PCR-positive for adenovirus and one for influenza A virus. Our data suggest that bioaerosol sampling could be valuable in monitoring for airborne respiratory viruses in clinical environments to better understand the risk of infection during a hospital visit.","Despite efforts to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections by measures such as practicing good hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment, hospital-acquired infections are still frequent. Two of the largest hospitals in Singapore report that on average, one in seven hospitalized patients acquire a nosocomial infection, 1 with immunocompromised children at greatest risk. Little is known regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses in clinical environments. Theoretically, influenza and other respiratory viruses are transmitted through contact with contagious persons and contaminated fomites. However, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the concept of transmis-sion through the inhalation of virus-laden particles. Specifically, airborne virus-laden particles ≤4μm are thought to play a significant role in respiratory virus transmission as they can remain in the air for prolonged periods of time and are inhaled deep into the lungs. 2"
Positional clustering improves computational binding site detection and identifies novel cis-regulatory sites in mammalian GABA A receptor subunit genes,"Understanding transcription factor (TF) mediated control of gene expression remains a major challenge at the interface of computational and experimental biology. Computational techniques predicting TF-binding site specificity are frequently unreliable. On the other hand, comprehensive experimental validation is difficult and time consuming. We introduce a simple strategy that dramatically improves robustness and accuracy of computational binding site prediction. First, we evaluate the rate of recurrence of computational TFBS predictions by commonly used sampling procedures. We find that the vast majority of results are biologically meaningless. However clustering results based on nucleotide position improves predictive power. Additionally, we find that positional clustering increases robustness to long or imperfectly selected input sequences. Positional clustering can also be used as a mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling approaches for improvements in accuracy over each one alone. Finally, we predict and validate regulatory sequences partially responsible for transcriptional control of the mammalian type A g-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA A R) subunit genes. Positional clustering is useful for improving computational binding site predictions, with potential application to improving our understanding of mammalian gene expression. In particular, predicted regulatory mechanisms in the mammalian GABA A R subunit gene family may open new avenues of research towards understanding this pharmacologically important neurotransmitter receptor system.","Understanding transcription factor (TF) mediated control of gene expression remains a major challenge at the interface of computational and experimental biology.

A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China,"Background: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities.","Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China. 1, 2 This region, considered a 'hotspot' for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified humananimal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases. 3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms, 4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source. 5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common. 6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife-livestockhuman interface for zoonotic disease emergence. 7 In recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system. 1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001. 8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world. 9, 10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and its closest relative is a virus identified in a Rhinolophus affinis bat from Yunnan. 10, 11 Environmental samples positive for 2019-nCoV were found in an urban market in Wuhan where some of the earliest known human cases originated. 12, 13 This likely index site sold predominantly seafood, but is also thought to sell live wildlife at the market, and a temporary ban on the wildlife trade for food has been put in place across China. These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reactiondriven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks. 14 However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes. 15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation."
More than efficacy revealed by single-cell analysis of antiviral therapeutics,"Because many aspects of viral infection dynamics and inhibition are governed by stochastic processes, single-cell analysis should provide more information than approaches using population averaging. We have developed a microfluidic device composed of ~6000 wells, with each well containing a microstructure to capture single, infected cells replicating an enterovirus expressing a fluorescent reporter protein. We have used this system to characterize enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. Single-cell analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can be distinguished by principal component analysis. Single-cell analysis of antiviral candidates not only reveals efficacy but also facilitates clustering of drugs with the same mechanism of action and provides some indication of the ease with which resistance will develop.","Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed outbreaks of myriad RNA viruses, including West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and, most recently, the poliovirus (PV)-related viruses: enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Unfortunately, viral emergence has outpaced the discovery and development of compounds capable of treating these pathogens. Because sporadic outbreaks come, go, and may never come again, development of broad-spectrum therapeutics exhibiting high barriers to resistance would have the greatest value. Unbiased screening of chemical libraries for antiviral agents using cell-based assays has no problem identifying active compounds of high potency. However, identifying the target and predicting the likelihood for evolution of resistance generally take years of effort following compound discovery."
Real time detection of farm-level swine mycobacteriosis outbreak using time series modeling of the number of condemned intestines in abattoirs,"Mycobacteriosis in swine is a common zoonosis found in abattoirs during meat inspections, and the veterinary authority is expected to inform the producer for corrective actions when an outbreak is detected. The expected value of the number of condemned carcasses due to mycobacteriosis therefore would be a useful threshold to detect an outbreak, and the present study aims to develop such an expected value through time series modeling. The model was developed using eight years of inspection data (2003 to 2010) obtained at 2 abattoirs of the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center, Japan. The resulting model was validated by comparing the predicted timedependent values for the subsequent 2 years with the actual data for 2 years between 2011 and 2012. For the modeling, at first, periodicities were checked using Fast Fourier Transformation, and the ensemble average profiles for weekly periodicities were calculated. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the residual of the ensemble average on the basis of minimum Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The sum of the ARIMA model and the weekly ensemble average was regarded as the time-dependent expected value. During 2011 and 2012, the number of whole or partial condemned carcasses exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the predicted values 20 times. All of these events were associated with the slaughtering of pigs from three producers with the highest rate of condemnation due to mycobacteriosis.","Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Complex (MAIC) is a common pathogen that, like M. tuberculosis, causes tuberculosis in humans and opportunistic infections in those suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [7, 15, 30] . Mycobacteriosis in swine caused by MAIC is a chronic infectious disease, which presents as caseous necrosis in submandibular lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes. In swine, the most common lesion is the one found in mesenteric lymph node [32] . Mycobacteriosis is the only known disease that forms caseous necrosis in animals and humans. Japanese meat inspection service follows the statements of a manual [20] : 'a caseous necrosis suggests mycobacteriosis', and it regards such case as mycobacteriosis without further microbiological examinations. Intestines are condemned when the caseous necrosis is a single lesion, and whole carcasses are condemned when the systemic infection is found, causing a significant economic burden for the pig producer."
IL-27 promotes the expansion of self-renewing CD8 + T cells in persistent viral infection,"Chronic infection and cancer are associated with suppressed T cell responses in the presence of cognate antigen. Recent work identified memory-like CXCR5 + TCF1 + CD8 + T cells that sustain T cell responses during persistent infection and proliferate upon anti-PD1 treatment. Approaches to expand these cells are sought. We show that blockade of interferon type 1 (IFN-I) receptor leads to CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion in an IL-27-and STAT1-dependent manner. IFNAR1 blockade promoted accelerated cell division and retention of TCF1 in virus-specific CD8 + T cells. We found that CD8 + T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling safeguards the ability of TCF1 hi cells to maintain proliferation and avoid terminal differentiation or programmed cell death. Mechanistically, IL-27 endowed rapidly dividing cells with IRF1, a transcription factor that was required for sustained division in a cell-intrinsic manner. These findings reveal that IL-27 opposes IFN-I to uncouple effector differentiation from cell division and suggest that IL-27 signaling could be exploited to augment self-renewing T cells in chronic infections and cancer.","During persistent viral infections and cancer, high antigen levels and the inflammatory environment promote functional exhaustion of antigen-specific T cells (Zajac et al., 1998; Wherry and Kurachi, 2015) . Exhausted T cells display poor effector functions and increased surface expression of multiple inhibitory receptors which maintain the hyporesponsive state (Barber et al., 2006; Blackburn et al., 2009) . Blockade of inhibitory receptors can rescue specific functions and enhance their ability to control persistent viral infections and cancer (Barber et al., 2006; Blackburn et al., 2009; Pardoll, 2012) . Recently, a subpopulation of exhausted, memory-like, self-renewing CD8 + T cells expressing CXCR5 and the transcription factor TCF1 was identified in mouse persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV) clone 13 (Cl13) infection and cancer models and patients infected with hepatitis C virus and HIV (He et al., 2016; Im et al., 2016; Leong et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Utzschneider et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Petrovas et al., 2017; Wieland et al., 2017) . These CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells, also termed T follicular cytotoxic cells (Leong et al., 2016) , were required to sustain antiviral T cell responses to chronic infections (Utzschneider et al., 2016) and provide the proliferative burst and effector function following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Im et al., 2016) . Given the efficacy of anti-PD-1 in cancer therapy coupled to the fact that only a finite number of PD-1-responsive CD8 + T cells exist in patients , understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation and expansion will provide crucial knowledge for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in both persistent infections and cancer."
PGHN Case Report Pediatric Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infection Presenting with Acute Cholestatic Hepatitis and Other Extrapulmonary Manifestations in the Absence of Pneumonia,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections mainly involve respiratory tract; however, also can manifestate other symptoms by site involved. Extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection are rarely known to occur without pneumonia. Herein we report a case of a 9-year-old boy who presented with acute cholestatic hepatitis in the absence of pneumonia. Rhabdomyolysis, skin rash, and initial laboratory results suspicious of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy were also observed in this patient. M. pneumoniae infection was identified by a 4-fold increase in immunoglobulin G antibodies to M. pneumoniae between acute and convalescent sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This is the first pediatric case in Korea of M. pneumoniae infection presenting with acute cholestatic hepatitis in the absence of pneumonia.","Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of respiratory infection in school-age children and adolescents. Extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection are known to affect dermatologic, cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic and hepatobiliary systems in children, which are usually known to occur as complications after pneumonia [1] . However, acute cholestatic hepatitis without pulmonary involvement in children with M. pneumonia infection has rarely been reported [2, 3] . We report a rare case of a child with M. pneumonia infection presenting with acute cholestatic hepatitis and other extrapulmonary manifestations in the absence of pneumonia. "
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins e24684-1 Intrinsically Disordered Proteins 1,"The ability of a protein to fold into unique functional state or to stay intrinsically disordered is encoded in its amino acid sequence. Both ordered and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are natural polypeptides that use the same arsenal of 20 proteinogenic amino acid residues as their major building blocks. The exceptional structural plasticity of IDPs, their capability to exist as heterogeneous structural ensembles and their wide array of important disorder-based biological functions that complements functional repertoire of ordered proteins are all rooted within the peculiar differential usage of these building blocks by ordered proteins and IDPs. In fact, some residues (so-called disorder-promoting residues) are noticeably more common in IDPs than in sequences of ordered proteins, which, in their turn, are enriched in several orderpromoting residues. Furthermore, residues can be arranged according to their ""disorder promoting potencies,"" which are evaluated based on the relative abundances of various amino acids in ordered and disordered proteins. This review continues a series of publications on the roles of different amino acids in defining the phenomenon of protein intrinsic disorder and concerns glutamic acid, which is the second most disorder-promoting residue.","Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are new exciting members of the protein kingdom. 1, 2 They are highly abundant in nature, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] possess numerous intriguing properties, 8 are intimately involved in various cellular processes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and are commonly found to be related to the pathogenesis of various diseases. 13, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] The common theme of protein disorder-based functionality is recognition, and IDPs/IDPRs are frequently involved in complex protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid and protein-small molecule interactions."
"Comparative Analysis of Host Cell Entry of Ebola Virus From Sierra Leone, 2014, and Zaire, 1976","The ongoing Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) epidemic in Western Africa is the largest EVD outbreak recorded to date and requires the rapid development and deployment of antiviral measures. The viral glycoprotein (GP) facilitates host cell entry and, jointly with cellular interaction partners, constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention. However, it is unknown whether the GPs of the currently and previously circulating EBOVs use the same mechanisms for cellular entry and are thus susceptible to inhibition by the same antivirals and cellular defenses. Here, we show that the GPs of the EBOVs circulating in 1976 and 2014 transduce the same spectrum of target cells, use the same cellular factors for host cell entry, and are comparably susceptible to blockade by antiviral interferon-induced transmembrane proteins and neutralizing antibody KZ52. Thus, the viruses responsible for the ongoing EVD epidemic should be fully susceptible to established antiviral strategies targeting GP and cellular entry factors.","Ebolaviruses, from the family Filoviridae, cause a severe and frequently fatal disease in humans [1] . The first documented outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire ebolavirus) disease (EVD) occurred in Zaire and was associated with a case-fatality rate of 88% [2] . Subsequently, 22 EVD outbreaks were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa [2] . These outbreaks generally occurred in relatively remote areas, were contained by quarantine measures, and caused a maximum of 425 cases per outbreak (during the 2000-2001 EVD outbreak in Uganda). The ongoing EVD epidemic, which originated in Guinea [3] , differs markedly from previous outbreaks: it affects Western Africa and is associated with a higher death toll than all previously recorded outbreaks jointly [4] . The massive scale of the epidemic is likely due to the delayed public health response. However, the currently circulating viruses harbor >30 unique amino acid substitutions [5] , and it is currently unclear whether these mutations allow for more-efficient spread in and between humans, compared with viruses responsible for past outbreaks."
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Quasispecies That Include Homologues of Human Isolates Revealed through Whole- Genome Analysis and Virus Cultured from Dromedary Camels in Saudi Arabia,"Complete Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) genome sequences were obtained from nasal swabs of dromedary camels sampled in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through direct analysis of nucleic acid extracts or following virus isolation in cell culture. Consensus dromedary MERS-CoV genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human MERS-CoV sequences. However, in contrast to individual human cases, where only clonal genomic sequences are reported, detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one genomic variant in individual dromedaries. If humans are truly infected only with clonal virus populations, we must entertain a model for interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV wherein only specific genotypes are capable of passing bottleneck selection.","(MERS), 88 of them fatal, have been reported since April 2012 (1) . Although examples of human-to-human transmission have been identified, the origin of infection with the causative agent, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is unexplained in the majority of cases (2) . Serologic evidence of infection in dromedary camels (DC) and, more recently, the detection of viral nucleic acid in DC, particularly in juvenile DC, suggest the possibility that DC may serve as a reservoir or vector for human infection (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, there are as yet no published analyses of complete MERS-CoV genomic sequences or virus isolation from DC in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)."
,"Diet-induced obesity is associated with systemic inflammation, which is considered to originate predominantly from the adipose tissue. Quercetin and resveratrol are two dietary polyphenols that exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and anti-insulin resistance when administered in isolation or combination (CQR). It remains unknown whether CQR reduces high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and inflammation in rats. In the current study, 46 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups, one of which was fed a normal diet (ND, 5.4% fat, w/w) and one of which was fed a HFD (45% fat, w/w) for 3 weeks. Following removal of the 12 most obesity-resistant rats from the HFD group, the remaining rats were divided into two sub-groups: A HFD group and a HFD+CQR group (administered 120 mg/kg/day resveratrol and 240 mg/kg/day quercetin). The results revealed that the HFD+CQR group had significantly lower body weights at 11 weeks compared with the HFD group and had significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue weights and adipocyte sizes. Serum lipid profiles were also significantly ameliorated in the HFD+CQR group. CQR attenuated the expression of systemic proinflammatory adipokines, including leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6. It also reduced the recruitment of mast cells to the epididyotic adipose tissue (EAT). Furthermore, CQR reversed the HFD-induced suppression of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression in EAT. In conclusion, CQR may suppress obesity and associated inflammation via the AMPKα1/SIRT1 signaling pathway in rats fed a HFD.","Obesity-induced systemic inflammation originates in adipose tissue prior to hepatic tissue (1, 2) . The human body contains various fat deposits, which can be divided into white and brown fat. White adipose tissue (WAT) is a multifunctional organ that stores nutrients in the form of fat droplets. In addition, WAT secretes cytokines that affect the body's metabolic state, thus it is sometimes regarded as the largest endocrine organ in the body (3) . Excessive energy intake induces adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which may lead to the development of high fat diet-induced obesity. Hypertrophic adipocytes release chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines to activate and attract inflammatory cells into WAT. This contributes to systemic insulin resistance and ultimately, a state of chronic low-grade adipose tissue inflammation (4) . Polyphenol intake is positively associated with a decrease in the incidence of metabolic and obesity-associated disorders. Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid compound present in a variety of fruits and vegetables, including onions, broccoli, tomatoes, apples and berries. It has a wide range of biological activities and health-promoting effects, including anti-carcinogenic (5) , antiviral (6) , antioxidant (7) , antidiabetic (8) , anti-inflammatory (9) , anti-aging (10) and angioprotective properties (11) . Furthermore, it has recently been suggested that quercetin exerts anti-obesity activity via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 5'-adenine Combination treatment with quercetin and resveratrol attenuates high fat diet-induced obesity and associated inflammation in rats via the AMPKα1/SIRT1 signaling pathway monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) signaling pathways (12) . Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in the skin and seeds of grapes and in red wine, may also protect against diet-induced obesity and metabolic diseases including hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (13) . In the present study, the effect of combination treatment with quercetin and resveratrol (CQR) was investigated in rats fed a HFD. The impact on CQR on HFD-induced fat accumulation, insulin resistance, proinflammatory cytokine levels, mast infiltration and AMPKα1/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling in adipose tissues was assessed."
Network analysis of host-virus communities in bats and rodents reveals determinants of cross-species transmission,"Bats are natural reservoirs of several important emerging viruses. Cross-species transmission appears to be quite common among bats, which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential. Therefore, understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species. Here, we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross-species virus transmission in bats and rodents, another important host group. We show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network, suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species. We identify host traits associated with important reservoir species: gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network. We identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence.","Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (passed from animals to humans), with > 70% originating in wildlife (Jones et al. 2008) . Cross-species transmission is one of the most challenging and least studied aspects of disease ecology, yet it is the defining process in zoonotic disease emergence (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 )."
Monoclonal Antiprothrombinase (3D4.3) Prevents Mortality from Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV-3) Infection,"The induction of monocyte/macrophage procoagulant activity (PCA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection and disease. Previously, we have shown that induction of PCA by MHV-3 correlated with resistance/susceptibility to infection in different mouse strains. In this study, all BALB/cJ mice that were infected with 103 plaque-forming units of MHV-3 developed severe liver disease and died within 96-120 h. Examination of the livers of these animals showed marked hepatic necrosis, deposition of fibrin, and cellular expression of PCA by direct immunofluorescence staining in areas of necrosis as well as in hepatic sinusoids. Splenic mononuclear cells recovered from these mice expressed high concentrations of PCA with time after infection. Infusion into mice of a high-titered monoclonal antibody that neutralized PCA (3D4.3) attenuated the development of hepatic necrosis and enhanced survival in a dose-dependent manner. All of the animals receiving 100 #g, and 44% and 22% of the animals that received 50 and 25 #g per day, respectively, survived for 10 d and made a full recovery. Administration of the antibody resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in fibrin deposition, PCA expression as detected by direct immunofluorescence staining and by a functional assay. In animals treated with high concentrations of antibody, titers of antibody to PCA fell from 87 +_ 15/~g/ml to 100 +_ 7 ng/ml during the active phase of the disease, consistent with sequestration due to binding of the immunoglobulin to cells expressing PCA. Surviving animals, when rechallenged with MHV-3, had a 40% mortality, consistent with the known rates of metabolism of immunoglobulin. This further suggested that protection was by a passive mechanism. The results reported here demonstrate that a neutralizing antibody to PCA protects animals from fulminant hepatitis and death associated with MHV-3 infection, and supports the notion that PCA is a potent inflammatory mediator that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of liver injury resulting from MHV-3 infection.",". Furthermore, using recombinant inbred strains of mice, we showed that genetic linkage between resistance/susceptibility to MHV-3 infection and induction of PCA was controlled by two non-H2-1inked recessive genes (5) . After infection with MHV-3, disturbances of the hepatic microcirculation associated with sinusoidal thrombosis occurred coincident with the rise in PCA (6, 7) . Intravenous infusion of macrophages, induced to express high amounts of PCA by MHV-3, resulted in rapid (2-5 min) death from disseminated intravascular coagulation in both susceptible and resistant mice (our unpublished observations). Together, these observations suggest that coagulative necrosis occurring as a result of induction of PCA may be a crucial feature of MHV-3-induced hepatic injury."
Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: experimental and clinical investigations,"Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be associated with various disorders. Recent investigation has involved clinical studies in collaboration with clinical investigators and pathologists on the pathogenetic mechanisms of ALI or ARDS caused by various disorders. This literature review includes a brief historical retrospective of ALI/ARDS, the neurogenic pulmonary edema due to head injury, the long-term experimental studies and clinical investigations from our laboratory, the detrimental role of NO, the risk factors, and the possible pathogenetic mechanisms as well as therapeutic regimen for ALI/ARDS.","Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious clinical problem with high mortality. [1] In animals and humans, ALI can be induced by various causes such as brain injury, [1] [2] [3] [4] enterovirus, [5, 6] Japanese B encephalitis, [7] and coronavirus. [8, 9] The risk factors for ARDS included septicemia, acid aspiration, infection, traumatic injury, fat embolism, ischemia/ reperfusion, and other caused.

Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with Pulmonary Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Infected with Influenza versus Other Respiratory Viruses,"Although the frequency of respiratory viral infection in patients with pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not uncommon, clinical significance of the condition remains to be further elucidated. The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. Methods: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014-June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses. (53.6% vs 26.7%, p=0.036). There were no significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was associated with 30-mortality (odds ratio, 1.158; 95% confidence interval, 1.022-1.312; p=0.022). Conclusion: Respiratory viral infection was not uncommon in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza virus was most commonly identified and was associated with more co-bacterial infection and ECMO therapy.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the chief conditions for which patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and contributes to substantial mortality rates 1 . Respiratory viral infection is not uncommon in critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure 2 . Some studies have reported that the frequency of respiratory viral infection ranged from 13.4% to 49% [3] [4] [5] . Availability of multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has facilitated the identification of respiratory viral infection 6 . Among the diverse risk factors for ARDS, respiratory viral infection has been shown to contribute to development and progression of pulmonary ARDS 7, 8 . Although several studies have reported the clinical impact of respiratory viruses on critically ill patients 3, 9 , further studies are needed to clarify the significance on those with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza viral infection in pulmonary ARDS has gained attention to intensivists due to high morbidity and mortality 10, 11 , but little data comparing characteristics and outcomes of the different types of viruses in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Moreover, differences in clinical outcomes between patients infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses have not been clearly elucidated."

Nasal microbiota and symptom persistence in acute respiratory tract infections in infants,"Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in infancy have been implicated in the development of chronic respiratory disease, but the complex interplay between viruses, bacteria and host is not completely understood. We aimed to prospectively determine whether nasal microbiota changes occur between the onset of the first symptomatic ARI in the first year of life and 3 weeks later, and to explore possible associations with the duration of respiratory symptoms, as well as with host, environmental and viral factors.","Viral infections in infancy and childhood represent a risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma [1] [2] [3] . In addition to viral infections, bacterial colonisation of the airways in neonates with certain species of bacteria, particularly Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been shown to be associated with the development of childhood asthma [4, 5] . It has been hypothesised that viral infections may sustainably alter epithelial function, increasing the risk for chronic airway disease [6] , and that changes in microbial diversity may play a role, particularly in symptomatic infants [7, 8] . It has also been recognised that the airway microbiota in patients with asthma exhibit distinct differences compared with healthy subjects [9] [10] [11] . Bacterial airway colonisation seems to influence and modulate respiratory morbidity in various conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [12] [13] [14] ."
The United States and global health: inseparable and synergistic? The Institute of Medicine's report on global health,"In the wake of dynamic economic and political transitions worldwide, the Institute of Medicine recently released its report advocating investments in global health from the United States (US). The expert panel reinforces the 'transnational and interdisciplinary' nature of global health research and practice as an endeavor 'to improve health and achieve greater equity for all people worldwide.' This report was judiciously timed given the growing recognition of global health, and is also acknowledged for incorporating themes that are particularly pertinent to the twenty-first century. New paradigms are introduced, denouncing the dichotomous distinction between rich and poor countries with the rapidly transitioning countries emerging as global powers, and affirming the need for models of respectful partnership and wider translation of science into practice. Cultivating sustainable partnerships and investing in the understanding and combat of diseases worldwide will become increasingly important for the US to maintain its global competitiveness, and may offer lessons in innovation, efficiency, and organization of institutions and human resources.","I n his recent speech at Cairo University on the 4th of June 2009, President Obama eloquently spoke of a rapidly globalizing world, ' . . .when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace.' (1) In line with this growing realization of contemporary global inter-dependence, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) recent report entitled 'The U.S. Commitment to Global Health: Recommendations for the Public and Private Sectors' 1 is particularly timely (2) . This report was the product of an expert committee, chaired by Harold Varmus, Nobel Laureate and former director of the United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH), and is an updated collection of recommendations, building on several influential organizations and texts that embody this theme (3Á5). Global health engenders issues that transcend national boundaries, and requires global cooperation, multi-disciplinary, and interdisciplinary involvement toward achieving greater socioeconomic and health equity, for both domestic and international populations (6) ."
Mechanisms of viral emergence,A number of virologic and,"Very few topics in Virology relate so closely to the general concept of biological complexity as the emergence and re-emergence of viral disease. In the introduction to their classic book, Solé and Goodwin define the sciences of complexity as ''the study of those systems in which there is no simple and predictable relationship between levels, between the properties of parts and of wholes'' [78] . The emergence of viral disease involves several levels of complexity. The underlying level stems from the population structure of viral populations as they replicate in their standard hosts. Model studies of plaque-to-plaque transfers (bottleneck Here two out of multiple distributions are represented. Horizontal lines depict individual genomes and symbols on the lines represent different mutation types (transitions, transversions and short insertions or deletions termed indels). A distribution is defined by a consensus sequence and a mutant spectrum with a complexity given by the average pairwise genetic (also termed Hamming) distance among its components or the average mutation frequency. (B) Molecular recombination. (C) Genome segment reassortment, using influenza A virus (eight genomic segments) as an example. Reassortment (in this case the replacement of HA and NA genes) gives rise to an antigenic shift. Continued accumulation of mutations results in gradual antigenic drift. (D) A simplified view of quasispecies dynamics and fitness change. Unrestricted replication (large black arrow-head on the right, with multiple passages indicated by the dotted line) results in fitness gain, as depicted by the triangle at the bottom. Fitness gain can occur without variation of the consensus sequence (top). In contrast, repeated bottleneck transfers (left, with the dotted line representing multiple transfers) result in accumulation of mutations that modify the consensus sequences, and in fitness decrease. At low and high fitness values significant fluctuations of fitness values have been observed. This figure is based on previously published data and concepts [4, 9, 11-14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 29, 31, 35, 41, 57, 59-61, 66, 71, 74] . passages) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in BHK-21 cells (Fig. 1) showed that the pattern of fitness decay of the virus followed a Weibull distribution [42] . This type of statistical distribution suggests that the mutations fixed in the viral genome at each transfer produced a cascade of perturbations in the virus-host interactions that were sensed in the form of a change in virus yield [42] . The unpredictability of the effect of mutations is further reinforced by the increasing evidence that viral proteins are multi-functional so that mutations can alter one or more of the interactions between viral and host components that determine the viral yield per cell [42] ."
The Moraxella adhesin UspA1 binds to its human CEACAM1 receptor by a deformable trimeric coiled-coil,"Moraxella catarrhalis is a ubiquitous human-specific bacterium commonly associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including otitis media, sinusitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The bacterium uses an autotransporter protein UspA1 to target an important human cellular receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the CEACAM1 receptor-binding region of UspA1 unusually consists of an extended, rod-like left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. Mutagenesis and binding studies of UspA1 and the N-domain of CEACAM1 have been used to delineate the interacting surfaces between ligand and receptor and guide assembly of the complex. However, solution scattering, molecular modelling and electron microscopy analyses all indicate that significant bending of the UspA1 coiled-coil stalk also occurs. This explains how UspA1 can engage CEACAM1 at a site far distant from its head group, permitting closer proximity of the respective cell surfaces during infection.","Moraxella catarrhalis (Mx) is a human-specific bacterium present in the nasopharynx of up to 75% of healthy individuals, but frequently causes childhood otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbation of lung conditions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Karalus and Campagnari, 2000) . As such, it is associated with widespread morbidity. However, there are no protective vaccines and antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem. Understanding the molecular events that facilitate the complex virulence mechanisms during Mx infection is key to the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines."
COOH-terminal Truncations Promote Proteasome-dependent Degradation of Mature Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator from Post-Golgi Compartments,"dence time at the cell surface. These in turn are responsible, at least in part, for the phenotypic manifestation of CF. We propose that the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway may be involved in the peripheral quality control of other, partially unfolded membrane proteins as well.","Abstract. Impaired biosynthetic processing of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated chloride channel, constitutes the most common cause of CF. Recently, we have identified a distinct category of mutation, caused by premature stop codons and frameshift mutations, which manifests in diminished expression of COOH-terminally truncated CFTR at the cell surface. Although the biosynthetic processing and plasma membrane targeting of truncated CFTRs are preserved, the turnover of the complex-glycosylated mutant is sixfold faster than its wild-type (wt) counterpart. Destabilization of the truncated CFTR coincides with its enhanced susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation from post-Golgi compartments globally, and the plasma membrane specifically, determined by pulse-chase analysis in conjunction with cell surface biotinylation. Proteolytic cleavage of the full-length complex-glycosylated wt and degradation intermediates derived from both T70 and wt CFTR requires endolysosomal proteases. The enhanced protease sensitivity in vitro and the decreased thermostability of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR in vivo suggest that structural destabilization may account for the increased proteasome susceptibility and the short resi-"
"Localization of the Lys, Asp, Glu, Leu Tetrapeptide Receptor to the Golgi Complex and the Intermediate Compartment in Mammalian Cells","The carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a closely-related sequence, is important for ER localization of both lumenal as well as type II membrane proteins. This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rabl is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues.

Syndromic Surveillance System for MERS-CoV as New Early Warning and Identification Approach,This commentary presents a novel outlook for public health authorities in the affected countries to detect and respond quickly to the emerging public health threats such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Implementing an innovative electronic surveillance system called syndromic surveillance system is essential for global health security.,"The global village in which we live has been transformed considerably in the past few decades due to epidemiological transition, changes in demography and the structure of people's lives, the threat of bioterrorism, and altered incidence and prevalence of diseases. 1, 2 In 2012, a novel virus not previously detected in humans was identified for the first time in Saudi Arabia. 3 From 23.09.2017 to 26.07.2019, the virus, now known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), infected more than 2454 people worldwide, leading to 848 MERS-CoV-associated deaths [global case fatality rate equal to 34.5%]. Typical MERS symptoms include cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is also common, but not always present and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, have been reported. To date, 27 countries in the world have reported cases of MERS-CoV. 4 The aforementioned problems have prompted the world health systems (especially health systems in the affected countries) to make changes in order to improve and promote the capability of their health systems. In the meantime, emerging infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV require surveillance systems providing an adequate lead time for optimal public health response."
MERS-CoV Infection in a Pregnant Woman in Korea,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal respiratory disease -caused by MERScoronavirus (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. Especially, pregnant women can be expected as highly vulnerable candidates for this viral infection. In May 2015, this virus was spread in Korea and a pregnant woman was confirmed with positive result of MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Her condition was improved only with conservative treatment. After a full recovery of MERS, the patient manifested abrupt vaginal bleeding with rupture of membrane. Under an impression of placenta abruption, an emergent cesarean section was performed. Our team performed many laboratory tests related to MERS-CoV and all results were negative. We report the first case of MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy occurred outside of the Middle East. Also, this case showed relatively benign maternal course which resulted in full recovery with subsequent healthy full-term delivery without MERS-CoV transmission.","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal respiratory disease caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and occurs mostly in the Middle East, initially by camel-to-human transmission, and then by human-to-human transmission. However, the disease was spread to other continents, probably by an index case, with subsequent pandemic outbreaks through human-to-human transmission through droplets and contact. During these respiratory viral outbreaks, pregnant women can be expected as highly vulnerable candidates for infection (1) ."
Membrane Protein Retention in the Yeast Golgi Apparatus: Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidase A Is Retained by a Cytoplasmic Signal Containing Aromatic Residues,"The mechanism by which yeast dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAP) A, a type II integral mem-","Abstract. The mechanism by which yeast dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAP) A, a type II integral membrane protein, is retained in the late Golgi apparatus has been investigated. Prior work demonstrated that the ll8-amino acid cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention and that mutant or overexpressed DPAP A no longer retained in the Golgi was delivered directly to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts, C. J., S. F. Nothwehr, and T. H. Stevens. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:69-83) . Replacement of the DPAP A transmembrane domain with a synthetic hydrophobic sequence did not affect either Golgi retention of DPAP A or vacuolar delivery of the retentiondefective form of DPAP A. These results indicate that the DPAP A transmembrane domain is not involved in either Golgi retention or targeting of this membrane protein. A detailed mutational analysis of the cyto-plasmic domain of DPAP A indicated that the most important elements for retention were within the eight residue stretch 85-92. A 10-amino acid region from DPAP A (81-90) was sufficient for Golgi retention of alkaline phosphatase, a type II vacuolar membrane protein. Detailed mutational analysis within this 10-amino acid sufficient region demonstrated that a Phe-X-Phe-X-Asp motif was absolutely required for efficient retention. The efficiency of Golgi retention via the DPAP A signal could be diminished by overexpression of wild type but not retention-defective versions of Kex2p, another late Golgi membrane protein, suggesting that multiple Golgi membrane proteins may be retained by a common machinery. These results imply a role for a cytoplasmic signal involving aromatic residues in retention of late Golgi membrane proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
FULL PAPER Virology p53-and ROS-mediated AIF pathway involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis,"We previously demonstrated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) could induce apoptosis through caspase signaling. However, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) on TGEV-induced apoptotic pathway. Results indicated that AIF translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during TGEV infection, and the AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (NP), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of AIF was inhibited by Veliparib (ABT-888), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). And the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC), redistributed AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in TGEV-infected cells. Moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mRNA levels of AIF were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α (PFT-α) or in TGEV-infected p53−/−cells. Furthermore, TGEV-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, PDTC, PFT-α, to treat PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the p53-and ROS-mediated AIF pathway and caspasedependent pathway were involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis.","Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), normally locates in the inner mitochondrial membrane and exert a cytoprotective role [17, 25, 26] . Recently, in contrast to its cytoprotective role in the mitochondria, AIF was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and subsequently to the nucleus, serving as a powerful proapoptotic trigger [3, 13] . Upon induction of various apoptotic stimuli, AIF partly bound to DNA, stimulated DNase activity and triggered condensation and large-scale fragmentation of chromatin, to induce apoptosis [25, 27, 30] . However, the proapoptotic effects were not prevented by caspase inhibitors, suggesting that AIF mediated a caspase-independent manner to trigger nuclear apoptosis [5, 16, 25] . Numerous lines of research have showed that a caspase-independent manner is involved in various stimuli-induced apoptotic programs [5, 6] , including viruses [10, 20] ."

[1] [2] [3] At the end of May 2019, there were a total of 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS with 838 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.5%, which is higher than the fatality rate of SARS) worldwide according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. 4 MERS cases have been reported in 27 countries, including countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America as well as Australia, and case numbers continue to increase, posing a global threat to public health. In China, the first patient infected with MERS-CoV from South Korea was diagnosed in May 2015, 5 and it will be extremely important to prevent, control, and treat MERS-CoV infections during any future outbreaks."
Detection of Sirtuin-1 protein expression in peripheral blood leukocytes in dogs,"Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent histone deacetylase with a large number of protein substrates. It has attracted a lot of attention in association with extending lifespan. The objective of this study was to enable the evaluation of SIRT1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from dogs by flow cytometry. Three transcript variants were amplified from PBMCs by reverse transcription PCR and the nucleotide sequences were analyzed. On the basis of deduced amino acid sequence, a monoclonal antibody against human SIRT1, 1F3, was selected to detect canine SIRT1. Canine SIRT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was successfully detected by western blotting using this antibody. Intracellular canine SIRT1 was also detected in permeabilized 293T cells transfected with a canine SIRT1 expression plasmid by flow cytometry using this antibody. SIRT1 was detected in all leukocyte subsets including lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. The expression level was markedly different among individual dogs. These results indicated that the method applied in this study is useful for evaluating canine SIRT1 levels in PBMCs from dogs.","Previous studies have characterized Sir2 protein as a pro-longevity factor for replicative lifespan in yeast [15, 20, 26, 46, 53] . Sir2 orthologs also extended lifespan in other organism species including Caenorhabditis elegans and flies [43, 50] . Because it has been suggested that the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on lifespan are mediated by Sir2 orthologs in higher eukaryotes [4, 7, 8, 44] , sirtuins received significant public interest. Sirtuins are a family of highly conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent protein deacylases found in eukaryotes. In humans, there are seven sirtuin homologs (SIRT1-7). All sirtuins require NAD + as a cofactor, making them prone to regulation by fluctuations in NAD+ conditions, thus linking them to cellular metabolism in response to nutritional and environmental perturbations such as caloric restriction. Of all the sirtuins, SIRT1 has received the most attention in relation to longevity. It deacetylates key histone residues involved in transcription regulation, and multiple non-histone proteins including p53, FOXO1/3, PGC-1α and NF-κB [11, 37, 51] . By targeting these proteins, SIRT1 is able to regulate numerous vital signaling pathways, including DNA repair, apoptosis, muscle and fat differentiation, neurogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, hormone secretion, cell stress responses and circadian rhythms [3, 37, 42] . In general, SIRT1 activation triggers nuclear transcription programs that enhance metabolic efficiency and up-regulate mitochondrial oxidative metabolism accompanying resistance to oxidative stress [13, 16] ."
Health care-associated infections -an overview,"Infection and Drug Resistance Dovepress submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress 2321 R e v I e w open access to scientific and medical research Open Access Full Text Article Abstract: Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) are infections that occur while receiving health care, developed in a hospital or other health care facility that first appear 48 hours or more after hospital admission, or within 30 days after having received health care. Multiple studies indicate that the common types of adverse events affecting hospitalized patients are adverse drug events, HCAIs, and surgical complications. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention identifies that nearly 1.7 million hospitalized patients annually acquire HCAIs while being treated for other health issues and that more than 98,000 patients (one in 17) die due to these. Several studies suggest that simple infection-control procedures such as cleaning hands with an alcohol-based hand rub can help prevent HCAIs and save lives, reduce morbidity, and minimize health care costs. Routine educational interventions for health care professionals can help change their hand-washing practices to prevent the spread of infection.","Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) are those infections that patients acquire while receiving health care. 1 The term HCAIs initially referred to those infections linked with admission to an acute-care hospital (earlier called nosocomial infections), but the term now includes infections developed in various settings where patients obtain health care (eg, long-term care, family medicine clinics, home care, and ambulatory care). HCAIs are infections that first appear 48 hours or more after hospitalization or within 30 days after having received health care. 2 Multiple studies indicate that the most common types of adverse events affecting hospitalized patients are adverse drug events, HCAIs, and surgical complications. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention identifies that nearly 1.7 million hospitalized patients annually acquire HCAIs while being treated for other health issues and that more than 98,000 of these patients (one in 17) die due to HCAIs. 8 The Agency for Health care Research and Quality reported that HCAIs are the most common complications of hospital care and one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the USA. 9 Out of every 100 hospitalized patients, seven patients in advanced countries and ten patients in emerging countries acquire an HCAI. 10 Other studies conducted in high-income countries found that 5%-15% of the hospitalized patients acquire HCAIs which can affect from 9% to 37% of those admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). 11, 12 Multiple research studies report that in Europe hospital-wide prevalence rates of HCAIs range from 4.6% to 9.3%. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] The WHO reports however that HCAIs usually receive public attention only when there are epidemics. 22 HCAIs also have impact on critically ill patients with around 0.5 million episodes of HCAIs being diagnosed every year in ICUs alone. 7, 14, 23 ICU patients are often in a very critically ill, immuno-compromised status which increases their susceptibility to HCAIs. 24, 25 Brief history There has been long-standing awareness that the practice of medicine can do harm as well as good. For example, Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, stated more than 2,500 years ago that ""I will use treatments for the benefit of the ill in accordance with my ability and my judgment, but from what is to their harm and injustice I will keep them."" 26 It was also recognized (eg, by Semmelweis discussing puerperal fever) many years ago that coming into hospitals (in particular) can be dangerous. 27 In this century, the idea that medicine could cause harm, including death is described as ""unintended physical injury resulting from or contributed to by medical care, including … [its] absence … that requires additional monitoring, treatment or hospitalization, or … results in death."" 28, 29 Offering another perspective, an American natural sciences writer noted that HCAIs are now killing around 100,000 people, many more than HIV/AIDS, cancer, or road traffic accidents. 30 The Hungarian obstetrician Professor (Dr) Ignaz Phillip Semmelweis is largely considered as the medical doctor who realized that health care providers could communicate disease. His work identified the mode of communication and spread of puerperal sepsis while working at the Maternity Hospital in Vienna. In 1847, he observed higher rates of maternal mortality among patients treated by obstetricians and medical students than among those cared for by midwives. At that time, he also found that a pathologist had died of sepsis after wounding himself with a scalpel while carrying out an autopsy on a patient with puerperal sepsis. The pathologist's illness mirrored that of women with puerperal sepsis, and Semmelweis wrote that both a scalpel and a physicians' contaminated hands could transmit organisms to mothers during labor. He introduced chlorinated lime hand washing to the obstetric hospital staff, resulting in large improvements in maternal mortality rates. 31 However, Semmelweis' theories were dismissed by most of the medical establishment because of a lack of appropriate statistical analysis of the data. Nevertheless, after Koch's postulates were published in 1890, the germ theory of disease and Semmelweis' theory of transmission of disease from doctor to patient were found to be valid. Semmelweis was therefore the first to describe an HCAI and provide an intervention to avert its spread through hand hygiene. 32"
"Veterinary Science pISSN 1229-845X, eISSN 1976-555X","The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic features of canine coronavirus (CCV) strains detected in Korea. M gene sequences obtained for isolates from 22 dogs with enteritis over a 5-year period were evaluated. Sequence comparison revealed that the 22 Korean CCV strains had an 87.2 to 100% nucleotide homology. Comparing to the typical reference CCV strains (type II), the nucleotide sequence of Korean strains had homology ranged from 86.3% to 98.3% (89.1% to 99.2% for the amino acid sequence) and 87.7% to 97.8% (92.4% to 100% for the amino acid sequence) when compared to FCoV-like CCV strains (type I). Three amino acid variations in the M gene were characteristic for the Korean CCV strains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the 22 Korean CCV strains belonged to four typical CCV clusters (i.e., a unique Korean CCV cluster, a type II and transmissible gastroenteritis virus cluster, an intermediate cluster between type I and II, and a type I cluster). This study was the first to identify genetic differences of the M gene from Korean CCV strains and provided a platform for molecular identification of different Korean CCV strains.","Canine coronavirus (CCV) is an enveloped RNA virus with a positive-sense single-stranded genome of 27∼32 kb in length [21] . This virus belongs to group I of the Coronaviridae family that includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and human coronavirus 229E [23, 30] . The close antigenic relationship between feline coronavirus (FCoV) and CCV facilitates a potential for cross-species infection [3, 13, 16, 20] . For both FCoV and CCV, interspecies recombinations have been found by sequence analysis in different parts of the viral genome (e.g., the spike [S] gene encoding the 'spike' on the viral surface and the membrane [M] gene encoding the 'membrane' or 'integral membrane' protein) [10, 18, 19] . A new FCoV type, designated as FCoV type II, has emerged in the field due to recombination (in the S protein gene region) of FCoV type I and CCV [10] . Epidemiological investigations have shown that FCoV type I is the predominant field virus type in the UK, Austria, and Japan [1, 5, 11] . Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated that FCoV type I strains bind to feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), a cell surface receptor in the lung, spleen, kidney, and gut while FCoV type II strains do not. The possible clinical and epidemiological impact of these findings is still unclear [5, 32] . In a recent study of S gene sequences obtained from field isolates, two types of CCV were identified. Pratelli et al. [24] [25] [26] [27] analyzed M gene sequences of CCV strains and found that the isolates belonged to two novel genetic clusters. The newly discovered FCoV-like CCV strain was different from typical CCV strains, and more closely related to FCoV strains than CCV strains [7] . Divergent FCoV-like CCV strains have emerged in particular from dog kennels and animal shelters. One study found that some FCoV-like CCV strains are more virulent than typical CCV strains and cause severe hemorrhagic diarrhea [4] . FCoV-like CCV stains have been found in Austria, Italy, and China [4, 26, 34] . Accurate genotyping for field CCV strains is undoubtedly important. However, only one molecular genetic study of Korean CCV strains has been performed to date [2] . Therefore, the present investigation was conducted to assess the molecular genetic features of CCV strains isolated in Korea. (Table 1) . Eight animals were male and 14 were female. The age of the dogs ranged from 5 to 31 weeks. Only 1 dog had received a CCV vaccination. Eleven dogs were vomiting and four had symptoms of respiratory disease such as coughing and nasal discharge. Canine parvovirus (CPV) was detected in all fecal samples in Table 3 . Sequence homology of nucleotides and deduced amino acids of the M gene in the Korean CCV isolates and reference strains which CCV was detected."
Human Coronavirus EMC Is Not the Same as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"A newly identified betacoronavirus, human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), has been isolated from several patients with respiratory and renal disease in the Middle East. While only a few infected patients have been identified, the mortality of the infection is greater than 50%. Like its better-known cousin severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), HCoV-EMC appears to have originated from bats. In a recent article in mBio, Müller et al. described several important differences between the two viruses [M. A. Müller et al., mBio 3(6):e00515-12, 2012, doi:10.1128/mBio.00515-12]. Unlike SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC can directly infect bat cells. As important, HCoV-EMC does not enter cells using the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin-converting receptor -2 (hACE2) . These results provide a strong incentive for identifying the host cell receptor used by HCoV-EMC. Identification of the receptor will provide insight into the pathogenesis of pulmonary and renal disease and may also suggest novel therapeutic interventions.","T he recent identification of a novel human coronavirus, EMC (HCoV-EMC), as the causative agent for severe human respiratory disease raised fears that a version of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic would recur. This fear prompted intense research efforts that resulted in publications describing the clinical characteristics of the human infection and complete sequence and genomic characterization of the virus (1) . Additional analyses showed that that the virus was related to two previously identified bat coronaviruses. Preliminary sequence analysis of virus isolated from a Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat in the Netherlands suggested an even closer relationship, with 88% nucleotide identity to a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In a recent article in mBio, Müller et al. provided important information about the host cell receptor used by the virus to infect cells (2) . First, the receptor is not human ACE2 (hACE2), which is used by the SARS coronavirus to infect humans. Second, the virus is able to infect human, bat, and porcine cells. The latter result is remarkable, because coronaviruses in general show fairly strict host specificity; in early studies of another betacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, serial passage was required for adaptation to human cells (3) ."
Potential use of Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H expressing DNA topoisomerase I in the screening of potential anti-breast cancer agents,"cancer chemotherapy possesses high toxicity, particularly when a higher concentration of drugs is administered to patients. Therefore, searching for more effective compounds to reduce the toxicity of treatments, while still producing similar effects as current chemotherapy regimens, is required. currently, the search for potential anticancer agents involves a random, inaccurate process with strategic deficits and a lack of specific targets. For this reason, the initial in vitro high-throughput steps in the screening process should be reviewed for rapid identification of the compounds that may serve as anticancer agents. The present study aimed to investigate the potential use of the Pichia pastoris strain SMd1168H expressing dna topoisomerase i (SMd1168H-ToPoi) in a yeast-based assay for screening potential anticancer agents. The cell density that indicated the growth of the recombinant yeast without treatment was first measured by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the effects of glutamate (agonist) and camptothecin (antagonist) on the recombinant yeast cell density were investigated using the same approach, and finally, the effect of camptothecin on various cell lines was determined and compared with its effect on recombinant yeast. The current study demonstrated that growth was enhanced in SMd1168H-ToPoi as compared with that in SMd1168H. Glutamate also enhanced the growth of the SMd1168H; however, the growth effect was not enhanced in SMd1168H-ToPoi treated with glutamate. By contrast, camptothecin caused only lower cell density and growth throughout the treatment of SMD1168H-TOPOI. The findings of the current study indicated that SMd1168H-ToPoi has similar characteristics to Mda-MB-231 cells; therefore, it can be used in a yeast-based assay to screen for more effective compounds that may inhibit the growth of highly metastatic breast cancer cells.","cancer chemotherapy uses drugs to prevent the growth of cancerous cells or kill cancerous cells in the human body (1) . in general, chemotherapy can be applied for three primary purposes: as an adjuvant therapy, in order to prevent the cancer cells from re-emerging following initial surgery or radiation; as a neo-adjuvant therapy, shrinking the tumour size for its easier removal with surgery; and as a treatment for metastatic disease, to reduce the number of cancer cells and kill cells that have spread to other parts of the body from the primary cancer location, such as to the lymph nodes under the arm in patients with breast cancer."

Studies on Influenza Virus Transmission between Ferrets: the Public Health Risks Revisited,Citation Fouchier RAM. 2015. Studies on influenza virus transmission between ferrets: the public health risks revisited. mBio 6(1):e02560-14.,"L ipsitch and Inglesby recently estimated the potential public health risks associated with research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets, leading them to conclude that such research is too risky to be conducted (1) . The authors of that and other publications (2) (3) (4) estimated the probability of laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) and onward transmission of the viruses under investigation, as well as the potential consequence to public health if such events were to occur. Given the weight assigned to these risk estimates, it is important that potential pitfalls in the underlying assumptions in these analyses be rigorously scrutinized. Importantly, the published estimates were based on historical data and did not take into account the numerous risk reduction measures that are in place in the laboratories where the research is conducted. Here, I provide a critical appraisal of the published work, discussing, challenging, and modifying the estimates based on the specific conditions under which the work is performed and the properties of the viruses under investigation. By doing so, the outcome of the risk assessment changes from serious risks to negligible risks for humans and the environment. As a consequence, a more balanced debate about the research on influenza virus transmission via respiratory droplets or aerosols between ferrets is warranted, in particular given the substantial public health benefits assigned to this type of research (5, 6) ."
The Propeptide of Preprosomatostatin Mediates Intracellular Transport and Secretion of c -Globin from Mammalian Cells,"We have investigated the role of the somatostatin propeptide in mediating intracellular transport and sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Using a retroviral expression vector, two fusion proteins were expressed in rat pituitary (GH3) cells: a control protein consisting of the/3-1actamase signal peptide fused to chimpanzee o~-globin (142 amino acids); and a chimera of the somatostatin signal peptide and proregion (82 amino acids) fused to ot-globin. Control globin was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as determined by accurate cleavage of its signal peptide; however, a-globin was not secreted but was rapidly and quantitatively degraded intracellularly with a hi2 of 4-5 min. Globin degradation was insensitive to chloroquine, a drug which inhibits lysosomal proteases, but was inhibited at 16°C suggesting proteolysis occurred during transport to the cis-Golgi apparatus. In contrast to the control globin, ,x,30% of the somatostatin propeptide-globin fusion protein was transported to the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus where it was endoproteolytically processed. Processing of the chimera occurred in an acidic intracellular compartment since cleavage was inhibited by 25 #M chloroquine. 60% of the transported chimera was cleaved at the Arg-Lys processing site in native prosomatostatin yielding ""mature"" a-globin. Most significantly, "",,50% of processed ot-globin was sorted to the regulated pathway and secreted in response to 8-Br-cAMP. We conclude that the somatostatin propeptide mediated transport of ot-globin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network by protecting molecules from degradation and in addition, facilitated packaging of c~-globin into vesicles whose secretion was stimulated by cAMP.","OST neuropeptides and small peptide hormones are synthesized as part of larger inactive polyprotein precursors in which the hormone sequence is flanked by pairs of basic amino acids (9) . To generate a bioactive molecule, the precursors undergo one or several posttranslational modifications including glycosylation, proteolysis, phosphorylation, amidation, and acetylation (9) . These processing events occur in different organelles during intracellular transport and therefore peptide hormone precursors are useful models to study movement through the secretory pathway. Recent observations demonstrate that several sorting and processing events occur in the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network (TGN) ~ and in maturing secretory granules (12, 29, 30, 44) . In particular, endoproteolytic cleavage at paired basic residues is initiated in acidic, clathrin-coated vesicles which bud from the TGN and the resulting mature hormone is stored in secretory granules (30, 31, 44) ."
Detection of Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Hospitalized,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause large disease burden each year. The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is quite common; however, the significance for clinical severity remains controversial. We aimed to identify viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI and the impact of mixed detections.","A cute respiratory infection (ARI), which could lead to serious complications including pneumonia, acute bronchitis, otitis media, and others, are thought to cause 4.25 million deaths each year. 1 The populations most susceptible to fatal respiratory infection are those very young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. 2 As the leading cause of illness in children, ARI causes approximately 1.8 million fatal cases of pneumonia per year among children <5 years of age. 3, 4 ARIs are classified as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Most URTIs are caused by viruses, including influenza virus A or B (IFVA/ B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (RV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human coronavirus (CoV). URTIs are common but rarely life threatening, whereas LRTIs can lead to more severe illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Both of these infections can also be caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and others. With the use of molecular detection techniques, simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory pathogens in patients with ARIs has been reported more frequently. 5, 6 The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is also quite common, especially in those less-developed countries. 7, 8 The significance of mixed detections for clinical severity is controversial with inconsistent results reported by the previous studies. The difficulties in establishing precise bacteriological or viral etiology and the frequent occurrence of mixed infections pose a challenge to medical treatment and clinical management. In the present study, we aimed to describe the detection of viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI in a subtropical city of mainland China, investigate the simultaneous detection pattern of multiple viruses and bacteria, and assess their association with clinical outcomes and severity."
In-depth Review Balkan endemic nephropathy-current status and future perspectives,"Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), originally described in 1956, is a unique familial, chronic renal disease encountered with a high-prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, longincubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN. Studies conducted over the past decade have provided particularly strong arguments that BEN and UUC are caused by chronic poisoning with aristolochic acids (AAs). In light of these later studies, one can raise the question whether AAs could be responsible for previously and currently widespread unrecognized global renal disease and UUC.","Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a familial, slowly progressive, chronic renal disease with insidious onset in the fifth decade of life and terminal renal failure in the sixth or seventh decade. The occurrence of BEN has been recorded with a high prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia ( Figure 1 ). The first cases were described in 1956 in Bulgaria, where Tanchev et al. [1] published the first detailed clinical description of the new entity. A year later, a renal disease with almost identical clinical and epidemiological characteristics was reported in Yugoslavia (Serbia) [2] . In 1961, it was found that a similar nephropathy was also prevalent in Romania [3] . The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, the long latent period before development of the disease, familial clustering of the disease and the remarkably high incidence of upper urothelial cancer (UUC) associated with BEN or occurring in the population at risk [4] [5] [6] . No cases have been documented in children or adolescents. The aetiology of BEN has been the subject of many published studies resulting in the generation of several hypotheses. Although data published on these various hypotheses have presented some indication of their relevance to the aetiology of BEN, only one of them, dealing with chronic aristolochic acid (AA) poisoning, has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN and its clinical characteristics."
Hairpin structure within the 3 0 UTR of DNA polymerase b mRNA acts as a post-transcriptional regulatory element and interacts with Hax-1,"Aberrant expression of DNA polymerase b, a key enzyme involved in base excision repair, leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Pol b expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3 0 UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3 0 UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element-the antiapoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA-protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol b mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol b.","In eukaryotic cells, DNA polymerase b (Pol b) is essential for base excision repair (BER) and involved in recombination and drug resistance (1, 2) . Pol b expression levels are important for the maintenance of genome integrity. On account of its low fidelity, the overexpression of Pol b, which has been reported in several cancer types, leads to a mutator phenotype associated with genetic instability and decreased sensitivity to anti-cancer chemotherapeutics (3) (4) (5) (6) . Conversely, cells deficient in DNA polymerase b display hypersensitvity to alkylating agent-induced apoptosis and chromosomal breakage (7) . Sugo et al. (8) have demonstrated that Pol b-deficient mice die immediately after birth, due to extensive apoptosis in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems. These data indicate that DNA polymerase b expression level is extremely important and must be tightly regulated."

GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE IN CYCLOSPORIN A-TREATED RATS AFTER SYNGENEIC AND AUTOLOGOUS BONE MARROW RECONSTITUTION*,"Cyclosporin A (CsA) ~ is a potent reversible immunosuppressive agent which is able to suppress allograft rejection and acute allogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1-7). Although CsA dramatically improves survival after allogeneic marrow transplantation, rats treated with a short course of CsA develop delayed onset GVHD after CsA withdrawal. This paper presents new evidence which indicates that GVHD may develop upon CsA withdrawal following not only allogeneic but also syngeneic and even autologous bone marrow reconstitution.","used for the histological documentation of GVHD (8) . Grade II acute GVHD was defined by the presence of lymphocytic exocytosis, epidermal destruction with vacuolar changes of the basal layer, and dyskeratotic cells."
Private specificities of CD8 T cell responses control patterns of heterologous immunity,"CD8 T cell cross-reactivity between viruses can play roles in protective heterologous immunity and damaging immunopathology. This cross-reactivity is sometimes predictable, such as between lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Pichinde virus, where crossreactive epitopes share six out of eight amino acids. Here, however, we demonstrate more subtle and less predictable cross-reactivity between LCMV and the unrelated vaccinia virus (VV). Epitope-specific T cell receptor usage differed between individual LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice, even though the mice had similar epitope-specific T cell hierarchies.","Variations in the pathogenesis of viral infections can sometimes be attributed to the infection history of a host, where exposure to unrelated pathogens may unexpectedly contribute either to protective immunity or to enhanced immunopathology (1). This heterologous immunity has now been demonstrated in several murine models of infection, where T cells specific to previously encountered viruses participate in the immune response to viruses subsequently encountered (2) (3) (4) . Recent work showing human T cell cross-reactivity between influenza virus and hepatitis C virus (5) , between influenza virus and Epstein-Barr virus (6) , between human papilloma virus and coronavirus (7) , and between different strains of dengue virus (8) argues that similar issues of heterologous immunity should be examined in human infections."
Development and evaluation of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a monoclonal antibody for diagnosis of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus in bovine sera,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae, is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease that impacts humans. This disease manifests as a decreased blood cell count and multi-organ failure, with a case-fatality rate of more than 12% in China. Because vaccines or antiviral drugs for the treatment of this disease are not available, monitoring the SFTS circulation in animals and controlling the tick-mammal cycle are important for preventing SFTS. Monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of SFTSV were generated to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for the detection of antibodies against SFTSV infection in cattle. The specificity and sensitivity of cELISA was assessed by comparing the results of this assay to those of an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The results of the cELISA using 416 field bovine serum samples and laboratory-immunized positive sera showed 98.1% consistency with those of the IFA. The cELISA used in this study did not show cross-reactivity with antisera against other viral cattle diseases. The cELISA presented in this study can be applied to detect antibodies against SFTSV in cattle.","Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-mediated infectious disease that was recently discovered in the rural areas of China [24] . The clinical characteristics of this disease in humans primarily include thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, high fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and imbalanced liver enzyme production [21] . The pathogen responsible for SFTS is the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel Phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae [21] . This virus contains three RNA genome segments coated with nucleoprotein (NP) that are encapsulated in an 80-to 120 nm diameter glycoprotein viral envelope [21, 24] . Since the first report of human SFTS in central China, additional cases have been reported continuously in other parts of China, Korea, and Japan [17, 25, 26] . In 2013, 36 patients were diagnosed with SFTS, and the fatality rate of this disease was 47.2% in Korea [6, 12] ."
,"The 7-year medical education program in Taiwan has been established since 1949. More than 60 years later, many medical professionals have observed and voiced its deficiencies following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The deficiencies are three-fold: (1) specialties are excessively institutionalized, (2) students engage in passive learning and memorization, and (3) passing one written national examination serves as the means of granting permanent physician qualification. The situation has aroused concerns and discussions among medical professionals and educators for a new medical education program. Authorized by the Conference of Deans of Medical Schools in Taiwan, Prof. Chyi-Her Lin assembled a team for planning medical curricular reform. Subsequently, Prof. Shan-Chwen Chang organized a task force team which has been monitoring the new 6-year program since 2013. The aims of medical reform by Prof. Lin are (1) to eliminate the specialty training part, (2) to use innovative teaching methods to motivate students to learn proactively, and (3) to implement competency-based medical education. Now, the first class of physicians will enter the workplace in 2019, subject to various clinical challenges.","M edical education is a professional cultivating program in which a student is transformed from a layperson to a physician through systematic learning [1] . It is aimed at cultivating professional physicians who are devoted to lifelong learning and self-improvement. According to criticism from the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation in 1998, Taiwan's medical schools began to initiate curricular reform to improve several deficiencies in medical education [2] . During the transformation of Taiwan into a developed country, citizens began to question the high social status of physicians, and educational philosophic thoughts from the USA started to influence the traditional curriculum design. Considering contemporary societal needs, the medical education program should be transformed. This review presents an exploration of the roots underlying the medical educational reform over the past 30 years and the prospects of future physicians in Taiwan [3] ."
The contribution of viruses and bacteria to community-acquired pneumonia in vaccinated children: a case-control study Respiratory infection,"Introduction respiratory pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia are often detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children, making their contribution to pneumonia difficult to determine. We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. Methods a case-control study was conducted among children <18 years in Perth, Western australia. cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (Pcr). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOr; 95% ci) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% ci) for pneumonia was estimated. Results From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. at least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOr: 4.7; 95% ci: 2.8 to 7.8). at least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOr: 0.7; 95% ci: 0.4 to 1.2). respiratory syncytial virus (rSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOr: 58.4; 95% ci: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOr: 14.5; 95% ci: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that rSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% ci: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively. Conclusions respiratory viruses, particularly rSV and HMPV, are major contributors to pneumonia in australian children.","in developing countries, pneumonia remains an important public health concern in developed countries where concerns are compounded by growing antibiotic resistance, replacement disease caused by vaccine-escape strains and the emergence of newly identified pathogens. 2 3 In Australia, there are two to eight pneumonia hospitalisations per 1000 childyears among children <5 years old; Aboriginal children have more than a 10-fold higher risk than non-Aboriginal children. 4 5 Globally, bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and encapsulated and non-encapsulated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, are considered as the primary cause of pneumonia in young children. 3 In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the role of respiratory viruses in childhood pneumonia, partly due to the reduction in bacterial disease associated with conjugate pneumococcal and Hib vaccine use 6 7 and the increased capacity to detect virus through molecular diagnostic methods. These sensitive techniques have enabled detection of viruses in up to 92% of respiratory specimens of children with pneumonia.

Effect of Caffeine and Reduced Temperature (20~ on the Organization of the Pre-Golgi and the Golgi Stack Membranes,"In the present study we have dissected the transport pathways between the ER and the Golgi complex using a recently introduced (Kuismanen, E., J. Jiintti, V. Miikiranta, and M. Sariola. 1992. J. Cell Sci. 102:505-513) inhibition of transport by caffeine at 20~ Recovery of the Golgi complex from brefeldin A (BFA) treatment was inhibited by caffeine at reduced temperature (20~ suggesting that caffeine inhibits the membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi complex. Caffeine at 20~ did not inhibit the BFA-induced retrograde movement of the Golgi membranes. Further, incubation of the cells in 10 mM caffeine at 20~ had profound effects on the distribution and the organization of the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack membranes. Caffeine treatment at 20~ resulted in a selective and reversible translocation of the pre-and cis-Golgi marker protein (p58) to the periphery of the cell. This caffeine-induced effect on the Golgi complex was different from that induced by BFA, since mannosidase II, a Golgi stack marker, remained perinucleady located and the Golgi stack coat protein, B-COP, was not detached from Golgi membranes in the presence of 10 mM caffeine at 20~ Electron microscopic analysis showed that, in the presence of caffeine at 20~ the morphology of the Golgi stack was altered and accumulation of numerous small vesicles in the Golgi region was observed. The results in the present study suggest that caffeine at reduced temperature (20~ reveals a functional interface between the pre-Golgi and the Golgi stack.",T RANSPORT inhibitors have been important tools in revealing the existence of functionally distinct compartments within the cell. Site-specific perturbation of the endomembrane architecture often results in the accumulation of transported proteins and membranes at specific steps along the transport pathways. In many cases the use of inhibitors has made it possible to identify functions and operating components resident in the sites of question.
,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a contagious coronavirus infecting pigs that leads to significant economic losses in the swine industry. Given that PEDV infection occurs in gut epithelial cells mainly via the fecal-oral route, induction of PEDV-specific immune responses in the mucosal compartment is required for protective immunity against viral infection. However, an effective mucosal vaccine against the currently prevalent PEDV strain is not available. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike (S) protein of PEDV represents a new vaccine candidate molecule to be applied via the mucosal route. We first established an Escherichia coli expression system producing the partial NTD (NTD 231-501 ) of the PEDV S protein. Orally administered NTD 231-501 protein specifically interacted with the apical area of M cells in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer's patch. Additionally, the NTD protein induced antigen-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal immune compartments when administered orally. Collectively, we propose the NTD of the PEDV S protein to be a candidate mucosal vaccine molecule.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causative agent of PED, was first described as a devastating enteric disease of pigs in the United Kingdom in 1971 (1) . PEDV is a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus that has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (2) . PEDV infection induces diarrhea, causing high mortality in suckling piglets and weight loss in older hogs, which have led to significant economic losses in the swine industry (3) . The PEDV genome consists of seven open reading frames encoding four structural proteins, the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane protein, envelope protein, and nucleocapsid protein (4) . Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 protein has been considered a major target Ag inducing neutralizing Ab production, because it interacts with aminopeptidase N (APN), a functional receptor involved in PEDV infection, on the host cell membrane (5) . Based on the observation that PEDV infection occurs mainly in epithelial cells of the small intestine via the fecal-oral route, and gross lesions are detected in the gastrointestinal tract of PEDV-infected animals, the establishment of mucosal immunity is required to induce protective immunity against PEDV infection (6, 7) . However, a mucosal PEDV vaccine is not available, and inducing mucosal immunity is difficult with current PEDV vaccine materials, which are administered intramuscularly, because the gut mucosa has a unique immune system, into which Ags enter only from the intestinal lumen due to the lack of afferent lymphatic vessels in mucosal immune-inductive site, compared with that of the systemic immune system. Interestingly, recent reports suggest that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein also interacts with 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid, a possible sugar co-receptor, expressed on epithelial cells and aids in PEDV infection in the host (8) . Consequently, use of the NTD as a mucosal vaccine material is a plausible vaccination strategy to protect against PEDV infection."
Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.ae The Role of CXCR3 in Neurological Diseases,"Background: Neurological diseases have become an obvious challenge due to insufficient therapeutic intervention. Therefore, novel drugs for various neurological disorders are in desperate need. Recently, compelling evidence has demonstrated that chemokine receptor CXCR3, which is a G protein-coupled receptor in the CXC chemokine receptor family, may play a pivotal role in the development of neurological diseases. The aim of this review is to provide evidence for the potential of CXCR3 as a therapeutic target for neurological diseases.","With the substantial prolongation of average life expectancy, the prevalence of neurological diseases increase markedly in the past decades, leading them to become a major public health problem [1, 2] . Unfortunately, few drugs are currently available to cure these diseases. Thus, new drugs for various neurological disorders are in desperate need. Chemokines are important modulators of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative processes [3, 4] .

The chemokine receptor CXCR3, which belongs to the CXC chemokine receptor family, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a vital role in mediating chemotactic migration, cell proliferation, and survival [6] [7] [8] . CXCR3 is mainly expressed by various effector T lymphocytes including CD4 + Th1 cells, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells [9, 10]. The principle chemokine ligands of CXCR3 are CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 [11] [12] [13] [14] . CXCL4, a plateletderived CXCR3 ligand, is weakly chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes and fibroblasts [15] . Mainly induced by interferon gamma (IFN-γ), CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are potent chemoattractants for monocytes, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. Although they share the same chemokine receptor CXCR3, these three ligands are regulated by unique promoters and exhibit distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns ( Table 1) . Recent studies have shown that the chemokine receptor CXCR3 was expressed in central nerv-ous system (CNS) diseases and involved in their pathogenesis [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . It was shown that the expression levels of CXCR3 and its ligands were elevated in the periphery blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with neurological diseases [21] [22] [23] , and were correlated with prognosis in certain cases [24] . Additionally, treatment with CXCR3 antagonists could alleviate bone cancer pain (BCP) induced mechanical allodynia [25] . These studies suggested an important role of CXCR3 in neurological diseases, indicating that targeting CXCR3 may reveal novel therapeutic interventions for the management of neurological diseases. Thus, here we summarize the current evidence supporting a role of CXCR3 in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, glioma, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy."
ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF FELINE CALICIVIRUS AND FELINE HERPESVIRUS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) are the two primary causes of upper respiratory tract disease in cats. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the distribution of FCV and FHV-1 among the feline population of several counties in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. To this end, conjunctival and nasal swabs were collected from 302 cats from different locations, including households, breeding catteries, veterinary clinics, animal hospitals and experimental research facilities. The samples were collected between July 2006 to June 2009. The virus isolation was performed in CRFK cells and, subsequently, the identification was confirmed by PCR. FCV, FHV-1, or both were isolated from 55 cats from 28 different locations. FCV alone was isolated from 52.7% (29/55) of the animals that tested positively, FHV-1 alone was isolated from 38.2% (21/55) of the animals that tested positively, and coinfection were detected in 9.1% (5/55) of the animals that tested positively. Virus detection was more prevalent in cats that were less than 1 year old, among animals that shared a living space with other cats, and females. FCV and FHV-1 were isolated from vaccinated cats. In addition, both viruses were isolated from cats that showed no signs of disease. The results suggest that a carrier state is common for both viruses in the evaluated population. A search for other causes of respiratory disease in that population is necessary; and further studies relating to the molecular characterization of viruses and vaccine efficacy are also necessary.","Infectious respiratory disease is a major clinical problem in feline medicine.

"Heparin-binding protein, lysozyme, and inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as diagnostic tools for pulmonary infection in lung transplanted patients","Pulmonary infection is a common complication after lung transplantation, and early detection is crucial for outcome. However, the condition can be clinically difficult to diagnose and to distinguish from rejection. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate heparin-binding protein (HBP), lysozyme, and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as potential biomarkers for pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients. One hundred thirteen BALF samples from 29 lung transplant recipients were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months, or on clinical indication. Samples were classified into no, possible, probable, or definite infection at the time of sampling. Rejection was defined by biopsy results. HBP, lysozyme, and cytokines were analyzed in BALF and correlated to likelihood of infection and rejection. All biomarkers were significantly increased in BALF during infection, whereas patients with rejection presented low levels that were comparable to noninfection samples. HBP, IL-1β, and IL-8 were the best diagnostic markers of infection with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values of 0.88, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. In conclusion, HBP, IL-1β, and IL-8 could be useful diagnostic markers of pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients.

However, Lntx patients may lack classical signs of infection due to heavy immunosuppression, and rejection may be asymptomatic. In addition, there are possible links between infection and the development of rejection. 4 For example, viral pneumonia has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and graft loss. 5 Antimicrobial peptides in respiratory secretions play an important role as a first line of defence against infections. 7 Lysozyme is the most abundant airway antimicrobial peptide, and is secreted primarily by neutrophils and sub-mucosal glands. 8 Heparin-binding protein (HBP) was initially recognized for its broad antimicrobial activity, but is now known to be a multifunctional inflammatory mediator that induces vascular leakage and acts as a chemoattractant and activator of monocytes. 9, 10 The protein is stored in secretory and azurophilic granules of neutrophils, and is rapidly released upon cell activation. 11 Plasma HBP has been described as a promising biomarker for severe sepsis and septic shock, 12 and elevated HBP levels have also been shown in cerebrospinal fluid during bacterial meningitis 13 and in urine during urinary tract infections. 14 Neither HBP nor lysozyme has previously been evaluated in BALF of Lntx patients. In this study, we quantified the two proteins together with the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in BALF collected during the first year after transplantation. The primary aim was to evaluate HBP and lysozyme as potential biomarkers for infection, and to determine their ability to discriminate infection from rejection in lung transplant recipients."

The Return of Lombroso? Ethical Aspects of (Visions of) Preventive Forensic Screening,"The vision of legendary criminologist Cesare Lombroso to use scientific theories of individual causes of crime as a basis for screening and prevention programmes targeting individuals at risk for future criminal behaviour has resurfaced, following advances in genetics, neuroscience and psychiatric epidemiology. This article analyses this idea and maps its ethical implications from a public health ethical standpoint. Twenty-seven variants of the new Lombrosian vision of forensic screening and prevention are distinguished, and some scientific and technical limitations are noted. Some lures, biases and structural factors, making the application of the Lombrosian idea likely in spite of weak evidence are pointed out and noted as a specific type of ethical aspect. Many classic and complex ethical challenges for health screening programmes are shown to apply to the identified variants and the choice between them, albeit with peculiar and often provoking variations. These variations are shown to actualize an underlying theoretical conundrum in need of further study, pertaining to the relationship between public health ethics and the ethics and values of criminal law policy.","Nineteenth-century Italian anthropologist and criminology and forensic psychiatry pioneer Cesare Lombroso is notorious for his idea (first published in Italian in 1876, see Parmelee, 1911 ) that crime originates from specific individual anomalies, and that a scientific mapping of these should be used for preventive criminal policy purposes. Ideally, 'criminal science' should facilitate early identification of 'moral insanity' to foresee which individuals risk developing criminal behaviour and to instigate suitable therapeutic, preventive or mitigating action (Lombroso, 1911; Parmelee, 1911 ). Lombroso's own specific ideas, as those of his US parallel Isaac Ray (1861) , regarding the purely biological nature of the causes of crime were criticized early on for paying too little attention to psychological and social factors (Ellwood, 1912) , and the very idea of a biological explanation of crime was criticized for undermining the institution of criminal justice (Gray, 1858) . 1 A student of Lombroso, Enrico Ferri (1895) , who shared Lombroso's basic assumption that criminal behaviour results from factors behind the individual's control, included social factors as possible causes for criminality, as may indeed have been Lombroso's own intention (Gibson, 2002) . This view was also endorsed by the Swedish psychiatrist Olof Kinberg (1935) , who argued that crime could and should be prevented by detaining the very sick criminals, try to treat those who can be treated, but also to reform society to eradicate poverty and ignorance."
Origin and Possible Genetic Recombination of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus from the First Imported Case in China: Phylogenetics and Coalescence Analysis,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a severe acute respiratory tract infection with a high fatality rate in humans. Coronaviruses are capable of infecting multiple species and can evolve rapidly through recombination events. Here, we report the complete genomic sequence analysis of a MERS-CoV strain imported to China from South Korea. The imported virus, provisionally named ChinaGD01, belongs to group 3 in clade B in the whole-genome phylogenetic tree and also has a similar tree topology structure in the open reading frame 1a and -b (ORF1ab) gene segment but clusters with group 5 of clade B in the tree constructed using the S gene. Genetic recombination analysis and lineage-specific singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparison suggest that the imported virus is a recombinant comprising group 3 and group 5 elements. The time-resolved phylogenetic estimation indicates that the recombination event likely occurred in the second half of 2014. Genetic recombination events between group 3 and group 5 of clade B may have implications for the transmissibility of the virus. IMPORTANCE The recent outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea has attracted global media attention due to the speed of spread and onward transmission. Here, we present the complete genome of the first imported MERS-CoV case in China and demonstrate genetic recombination events between group 3 and group 5 of clade B that may have implications for the transmissibility of MERS-CoV.

Intracellular Vesicle Fusion Requires a Membrane-Destabilizing Peptide Located at the Juxtamembrane Region of the v-SNARE,"Intracellular vesicle fusion is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SMmediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.","Membrane fusion-the merging of two lipid bilayers into one-involves substantial membrane remodeling and lipid rearrangements, imposing a high energy barrier that must be overcome by specialized membrane fusion proteins Martens and McMahon, 2008; Südhof and Rothman, 2009 ). An extensively studied form of membrane fusion is the merging of intracellular vesicles with their target membranes, which transports cargo proteins between organelles in the endomembrane system (Baker and Hughson, 2016; Brunger et al., 2009; Ohya et al., 2009; Wickner, 2010) . Intracellular vesicle fusion is driven by two conserved families of molecules: SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and SM (Sec1/Munc18) proteins (Rizo and Südhof, 2012; Shen et al., 2007) . The vesicle-anchored v-SNARE pairs with the target membraneassociated t-SNAREs to form a four-helix trans-SNARE complex, forcing the two ensures SNARE pairing specificity (Baker et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2018) ."
Use of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Gain-Of-Function Studies for Molecular-Based Surveillance and Pandemic Preparedness,. Use of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) gain-of-function studies for molecular-based surveillance and pandemic preparedness. mBio 5(6):e02431-14.,"Z oonotic influenza viruses circulating in poultry and swine pose an ever present threat to human health. In particular, the rapid geographical expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) throughout Asia and then into Europe, the Middle East, and Africa during the 2000s galvanized the global community in an attempt to control this rapidly growing threat. Despite successful control efforts in some countries, the virus remains endemic in poultry in at least six countries and continues to cause human illness and deaths as well as countless outbreaks in birds. During the past decade, 668 cases and 393 deaths were detected and reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (1) . During the 17 years since human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) were first identified in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China, in 1997, these viruses have evolved substantially through mutation and reassortment, resulting in multiple divergent genotypes and clades (2) ."
Signal Recognition Particle-dependent Membrane Insertion of Mouse Invariant Chain: A Membrane-spanning Protein with a Cytoplasmically Exposed Amino Terminus,Invariant (Ii) chain is a membrane-spanning protein that is found associated intracellularly with class II histocompatibility antigens.,"~ ECRETORY and many membrane-spanning proteins are translocated across or inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ~ in a co-translational manner (for review see references 3, 21, 35, 50, and 51). Translocation requires a signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide chain and specific receptors, the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the docking protein (DP) or SRP receptor (1, 2, 6, 18, 19, 32, 33, 38, [46] [47] [48] [49] . SRP has been shown to interact with polysomes holding nascent preprolactin chains, and it has been proposed that SRP binds to the signal sequence (46) . When probed in a wheat germ cell free system with prolactin or IgG light chain mRNAs, SRP arrests the peptide elongation after 70-80 amino acids have been polymerized (33, 47, 48) . Elongation proceeds after SRP has bound to the DP, which is located in the ER membranes (18, 19, 33) ."
Influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia: HRCT findings* Pneumonia por vírus influenza A (H1N1): aspectos na TCAR,"Objective: To describe aspects found on HRCT scans of the chest in patients infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the HRCT scans of 71 patients (38 females and 33 males) with H1N1 infection, confirmed through laboratory tests, between July and September of 2009. The HRCT scans were interpreted by two thoracic radiologists independently, and in case of disagreement, the decisions were made by consensus. Results: The most common HRCT findings were ground-glass opacities (85%), consolidation (64%), or a combination of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (58%). Other findings were airspace nodules (25%), bronchial wall thickening (25%), interlobular septal thickening (21%), crazy-paving pattern (15%), perilobular pattern (3%), and air trapping (3%). The findings were frequently bilateral (89%), with a random distribution (68%). Pleural effusion, when observed, was typically minimal. No lymphadenopathy was identified. Conclusions: The most common findings were ground-glass opacities and consolidations, or a combination of both. Involvement was commonly bilateral with no axial or craniocaudal predominance in the distribution. Although the major tomographic findings in H1N1 infection are nonspecific, it is important to recognize such findings in order to include infection with the H1N1 virus in the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms.",features of the disease becomes important in clinical practice.
Assessment of the ability of V920 recombinant vesicular stomatitis-Zaire ebolavirus vaccine to replicate in relevant arthropod cell cultures and vector species,"V920, rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP, is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis-Zaire ebolavirus vaccine which has shown an acceptable safety profile and provides a protective immune response against Ebola virus disease (EVD) induced by Zaire ebolavirus in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the V920 vaccine is capable of replicating in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species and of replicating in live mosquitoes. While the V920 vaccine replicated well in Vero cells, no replication was observed in Anopheles or Aedes mosquito, Culicoides biting midge, or Lutzomyia sand fly cells, nor in live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes following exposure through intrathoracic inoculation or feeding on a high-titer infectious blood meal. The insect taxa selected for use in this study represent actual and potential epidemic vectors of VSV. V920 vaccine inoculated into Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated persistence of replication-competent virus following inoculation, consistent with the recognized biological stability of the vaccine, but no evidence for active virus replication in live mosquitoes was observed. Following administration of an infectious blood meal to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at a titer several log 10 PFU more concentrated than would be observed in vaccinated individuals, no infection or dissemination of V920 was observed in either mosquito species. In vitro and in vivo data gathered during this study support minimal risk of the vector-borne potential of the V920 vaccine.","The genus Ebolavirus of the family Filoviridae (Order: Mononegavirales) is comprised of five recognized species, with Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) representing the prototype species. ZEBOV is a significant human pathogen with case fatality rates often reaching 90%. To date there have been numerous outbreaks of ZEBOV, 1 the largest of which occurred in West Africa in 2014 and resulted in >28,000 human cases and >11,000 deaths. 2, 3 The high case fatality rate and magnitude of the 2014 outbreak in West Africa illustrates the pressing need for the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine to prevent future ZEBOV outbreaks."
Rotavirus Disrupts Calcium Homeostasis by NSP4 Viroporin Activity,"Many viruses alter intracellular calcium homeostasis. The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca 2؉ ([Ca 2؉ ]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca 2؉ ]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic ␣-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca 2؉ by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca 2؉ ]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca 2؉ ]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca 2؉ ]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.","disrupt calcium homeostasis in ways that favor virus replication, assembly, and/or release (14, 15) . The best-characterized viroporins that disrupt calcium homeostasis are the enterovirus 2B proteins (16) . Biochemical analysis indicates that 2B forms a transmembrane hairpin structure that inserts into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and plasma membranes (17) . The ability of 2B to increase levels of cytoplasmic Ca 2ϩ ([Ca 2ϩ ]cyto) depends on the cationic and amphipathic nature of the pore-forming domain and is essential for virus release (18) ."
A design principle for a single-stranded RNA genome that replicates with less double-strand formation,"Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is the simplest form of genetic molecule and constitutes the genome in some viruses and presumably in primitive life-forms. However, an innate and unsolved problem regarding the ssRNA genome is formation of inactive doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) during replication. Here, we addressed this problem by focusing on the secondary structure. We systematically designed RNAs with various structures and observed dsRNA formation during replication using an RNA replicase (Q␤ replicase). From the results, we extracted a simple rule regarding ssRNA genome replication with less dsRNA formation (less GC number in loops) and then designed an artificial RNA that encodes a domain of the ␤-galactosidase gene based on this rule. We also obtained evidence that this rule governs the natural genomes of all bacterial and most fungal viruses presently known. This study revealed one of the structural design principles of an ssRNA genome that replicates continuously with less dsRNA formation.","Translation and replication of genetic information are fundamental functions of all living organisms. The primary carrier of genetic information (genome) is DNA; however, some viruses utilize single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) as the material basis of their genomes. Because ssRNA replicates by a simpler mechanism than DNA, it is used as the genome in primitive life-forms that evolved in the RNA world or the later RNA-protein world (1, 2) , and is also proposed to be useful as the basis of a genome for an artificial cell (3) ."
Regulated Ire1-dependent decay of messenger RNAs in mammalian cells,"Abbreviations used in this paper: BiP, immunoglobin-binding protein; FRT, ferritinlike protein recombination target; hIre1, human Ire1-; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RIDD, regulated Ire1-dependent decay; Tm, tunicamycin; UPR, unfolded protein response.","The ER is responsible for folding and processing proteins entering the secretory pathway and uses a variety of mechanisms to adjust its capacity in response to changes in the folding burden. This collection of mechanisms, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR; Ron and Walter, 2007) , is activated by stress caused by environmental stimuli and diseases such as viral infection (Tardif et al., 2004; Bechill et al., 2008) and multiple myeloma (Carrasco et al., 2007) . In metazoans, components of the UPR are essential for developmental processes requiring high levels of secretion such as the differentiation of plasma cells (Gass et al., 2002; Iwakoshi et al., 2003) and pancreatic  cells (Harding et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2002) . The UPR restores ER function both by increasing its capacity and decreasing the load of new proteins through transcriptional induction of secretory pathway components and general translational attenuation. One of the key players in the UPR is Ire1 (inositolrequiring enzyme 1), a conserved transmembrane protein with a luminal domain that senses protein misfolding in the ER."
Local and Regional Anesthesia Dovepress Spinal anesthesia after intraoperative cardiac arrest during general anesthesia in an infant,"Although generally safe and effective, severe perioperative complications, including cardiac arrest, may occur during general anesthesia in infants. With the emergence of evidence that specific anesthetic agents may affect future neurocognitive outcomes, there has been an increased focus on alternatives to general anesthesia, including spinal anesthesia. We present a case of cardiac arrest during general anesthesia in an infant who required urologic surgery. During the subsequent anesthetic care, spinal anesthesia was offered as an alternative to general anesthesia. The risks of severe perioperative complications during general anesthesia are reviewed, etiologic factors for such events are presented, and the use of spinal anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia is discussed.","In 1899, August Bier reported the successful use of spinal anesthesia in an 11-yearold child during excision of a tumor on the thigh. 1 This initial report was followed by the publication in the early 1900s of two case series regarding the use of spinal anesthesia in infants and children. 2, 3 However, despite its popularity in adults, the technique never gained great popularity in pediatric anesthesia until the 1980s when it was shown to be a suitable alternative to general anesthesia in the high-risk, former preterm neonate. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In this population, spinal anesthesia was suggested as a means of limiting the incidence of postoperative complications, especially apnea and respiratory insufficiency, which were noted following general anesthesia with halothane. 10 However, once again the enthusiasm waned as the risk of apnea was shown to be limited with the new volatile anesthetic agents, sevoflurane and desflurane. 11, 12 The resurgence in popularity of spinal anesthesia has occurred for a number of reasons that are not limited to postoperative apnea."
One Health research and training and government support for One Health in South Asia,"Introduction: Considerable advocacy, funding, training, and technical support have been provided to South Asian countries to strengthen One Health (OH) collaborative approaches for controlling diseases with global human pandemic potential since the early 2000s. It is essential that the OH approach continues to be strengthened given South Asia is a hot spot for emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases. The objectives of this article are to describe OH research and training and capacity building activities and the important developments in government support for OH in these countries to identify current achievements and gaps. Materials and methods: A landscape analysis of OH research, training, and government support in South Asia was generated by searching peer-reviewed and grey literature for OH research publications and reports, a questionnaire survey of people potentially engaged in OH research in South Asia and the authors' professional networks. Results: Only a small proportion of zoonotic disease research conducted in South Asia can be described as truly OH, with a significant lack of OH policy-relevant research. A small number of multisectoral OH research and OH capacity building programmes were conducted in the region. The governments of Bangladesh and Bhutan have established operational OH strategies, with variable progress institutionalising OH in other countries. Identified gaps were a lack of useful scientific information and of a collaborative culture for formulating and implementing integrated zoonotic disease control policies and the need for ongoing support for transdisciplinary OH research and policy-relevant capacity building programmes. Discussion: Overall we found a very small number of truly OH research and capacity building programmes in South Asia. Even though significant progress has been made in institutionalising OH in some South Asian countries, further behavioural, attitudinal, and institutional changes are required to strengthen OH research and training and implementation of sustainably effective integrated zoonotic disease control policies. C ollaborative One Health (OH) approaches that integrate the formulation, funding, implementation, and governance of control policies involving human, animal, and wildlife populations are required to more effectively control endemic zoonotic diseases and to detect and manage emerging zoonotic diseases (1). This is especially important in South Asia, which is a hot spot for endemic and emerging infectious zoonotic diseases (2, 3).","Major neglected endemic zoonotic diseases, such as rabies, continue to impact human and animal health in South Asia, with a disproportionate effect on poor and marginalised communities (4Á6)."

The invasion of tobacco mosaic virus RNA induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-related autophagy in HeLa cells,& $ %,"Evolution occurs through natural selection. The evolutionary rate of change of viruses is much higher than that of other microorganisms. Due to the high frequency of viral mutation and reproduction, the ability of viruses to escape from host immune proteasomal degradation is difficult to predict. Although numerous studies have identified viral immune escape mechanisms [1, 2] , there is insufficient evidence to fully define these mechanisms in detail. One reason for this lack of evidence is that viruses hosts diverge farther away from humans, yet all of these virulent viruses have crossed the species barrier to invade humans. It is important to speculate from which distant species a new virus will emerge to invade humans in the next disaster. Such a virus may be from a plant, whose origin is even more distant from humans. Due to the pressure of natural selection and human exploration in the biosphere, it is possible for a plant virus to evolve the ability to invade the human body as its 'fresh' host, regardless of whether it has a specific receptor on human cellular membranes."
Original Article,"The recent emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) underscore the urgent need for the development of novel, safe, and effective vaccines against the prevailing strain. In this study, we generated a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine candidate (Aram-P29-CA) by short-term passage of a virulent PEDV isolate at successively lower temperatures in Vero cells. Whole genome sequencing identified 12 amino acid changes in the cold-adapted strain with no insertions and deletions throughout the genome. Animal inoculation experiments confirmed the attenuated phenotype of Aram-P29-CA virus in the natural host. Pregnant sows were orally administered P29-CA live vaccines two doses at 2-week intervals prior to parturition, and the newborn piglets were challenged with the parental virus. The oral homologous prime-boost vaccination of P29-CA significantly improved the survival rate of the piglets and notably mitigated the severity of diarrhea and PEDV fecal shedding after the challenge. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were detected in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows and in the sera of their offspring. These results demonstrated that the cold-adapted attenuated virus can be used as a live vaccine in maternal vaccination strategies to provide durable lactogenic immunity and confer passive protection to litters against PEDV.","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, belonging to in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. PEDV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a 5′ capped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb, with a 3′ polyadenylated tail [1, 2] . The PEDV genome consists of seven canonical genes, including an open reading frame (ORF) 3, flanked by 5′-and 3′-untranslated region (UTRs). The first two large ORFs comprise two-thirds of the genome and encode the replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, which are then posttranslationally cleaved into 16 mature non-structural proteins (nsp1-16). The last one-third encodes four canonical coronavirus structural proteins in a fixed order, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as a single accessory gene encoding ORF3 between S and M [1] [2] [3] . The virus can be phylogenetically divided into two genotypes comprising two sub-genotypes: genogroup 1 (classical G1a and recombinant G1b) with low-pathogenicity, and genogroup 2 (local epidemic G2a and global epidemic or pandemic G2b) with high-pathogenicity [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] ."
The Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma and Hyperimmune Immunoglobulin for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections of Viral Etiology: A Systematic Review and Exploratory Meta-analysis,"Background. Administration of convalescent plasma, serum, or hyperimmune immunoglobulin may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) of viral etiology. We conducted a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis to assess the overall evidence.","As of 23 May 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been informed of 635 persons with laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, of whom 193 (30%) have died [1] . The current approach to clinical management of MERS-CoV infection centers on general supportive care, with provision of critical care and organ support when necessary [2] . It has recently been suggested that administration of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin will yield a clinical effect for treatment of MERS-CoV infection [3] . However, numerous uncertainties remain because the clinical course, viral replication kinetics, and host interactions are yet to be fully established [4] . Furthermore, the underlying evidence is based on studies of varying size and quality that describe clinical experience in treating other viral infections, including those due to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Spanish influenza A(H1N1), avian influenza A(H5N1), and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (hereafter, ""influenza A[H1N1]pdm09"") [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] ."
Biosafety considerations for attenuated measles virus vectors used in virotherapy and vaccination,"Attenuated measles virus (MV) is one of the most effective and safe vaccines available, making it attractive candidate vector to prevent infectious diseases. Attenuated MV have acquired the ability to use the complement regulator CD46 as a major receptor to mediate virus entry and intercellular fusion. Therefore, attenuated MV strains preferentially infect and destroy a wide variety of cancer cells making them also attractive oncolytic vectors. The use of recombinant MV vector has to comply with various regulatory requirements, particularly relating to the assessment of potential risks for human health and the environment. The present article highlights the main characteristics of MV and recombinant MV vectors used for vaccination and virotherapy and discusses these features from a biosafety point of view.","Attenuated measles virus (MV) represents an attractive vector candidate for virotherapy and vaccination. This is due to several features including: (i) impressive track record of safety and efficacy in human population, (ii) lack of genomic integration in the host cells due to their cytoplasmic replication, (iii) high immunogenicity as vaccine, (iv) compared to other RNA viruses MV maintain high levels of genetic stability, 1 (v) large foreign gene(s) insertion capacity (>6 kb) 2 and (vi) selectivity to tumor cells in case of virotherapy applications."
The many paths to frameshifting: kinetic modelling and analysis of the effects of different elongation steps on programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting,"Several important viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the SARSassociated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) employ programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) for their protein expression. Here, a kinetic framework is developed to describe À1 PRF. The model reveals three kinetic pathways to À1 PRF that yield two possible frameshift products: those incorporating zero frame encoded A-site tRNAs in the recoding site, and products incorporating À1 frame encoded A-site tRNAs. Using known kinetic rate constants, the individual contributions of different steps of the translation elongation cycle to À1 PRF and the ratio between two types of frameshift products were evaluated. A dual fluorescence reporter was employed in Escherichia coli to empirically test the model. Additionally, the study applied a novel mass spectrometry approach to quantify the ratios of the two frameshift products. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying À1 PRF may provide insight into developing antiviral therapeutics.","Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a process where specific signals in the mRNA direct the ribosome to switch reading frame at a certain efficiency. In À1 PRF, the ribosome slips 1 nt towards the 5 0 -end of the mRNA during translation. Several viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), employ À1 PRF to synthesize precursors of enzymes for their replication (1, 2) , and the ratio of the zero frame to À1 frame encoded products is important to the vitality of viruses (3) (4) (5) . As such, altering À1 PRF efficiency may damage viral replication [reviewed in (6) ]. This suggests À1 PRF as a target for the development of antiviral therapeutics."
Why should cell biologists study microbial pathogens?,"One quarter of all deaths worldwide each year result from infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens. Pathogens infect and cause disease by producing virulence factors that target host cell molecules. Studying how virulence factors target host cells has revealed fundamental principles of cell biology. These include important advances in our understanding of the cytoskeleton, organelles and membrane-trafficking intermediates, signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulators, the organelle/protein recycling machinery, and cell-death pathways. Such studies have also revealed cellular pathways crucial for the immune response. Discoveries from basic research on the cell biology of pathogenesis are actively being translated into the development of host-targeted therapies to treat infectious diseases. Thus there are many reasons for cell biologists to incorporate the study of microbial pathogens into their research programs.","Infectious diseases cause approximately one quarter of all deaths worldwide each year (Fauci and Morens, 2012) . These include the ""big three""-HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria-which account for 10% of all deaths. They also include emerging diseases such as Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Infections are caused by microbial pathogens from different domains of the tree of life-viruses, bacteria, or eukaryotes. All share the ability to colonize their hosts and cause pathology through their interactions with host cells."
Toxicogenomics analysis of mouse lung responses following exposure to titanium dioxide nanomaterials reveal their disease potential at high doses,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) induce lung inflammation in experimental animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of lung responses in mice exposed to six individual TiO 2 NPs exhibiting different sizes (8, 20 and 300 nm), crystalline structure (anatase, rutile or anatase/rutile) and surface modifications (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) to investigate whether the mechanisms leading to TiO 2 NP-induced lung inflammation are property specific. A detailed histopathological analysis was conducted to investigate the long-term disease implications of acute exposure to TiO 2 NPs. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 18, 54, 162 or 486 µg of TiO 2 NPs/mouse via single intratracheal instillation. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium only. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were sampled on 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Although all TiO 2 NPs induced lung inflammation as measured by the neutrophil influx in BALF, rutile-type TiO 2 NPs induced higher inflammation with the hydrophilic rutile TiO 2 NP showing the maximum increase. Accordingly, the rutile TiO 2 NPs induced higher number of differentially expressed genes. Histopathological analysis of lung sections on Day 90 post-exposure showed increased collagen staining and fibrosislike changes following exposure to the rutile TiO 2 NPs at the highest dose tested. Among the anatase, the smallest TiO 2 NP of 8 nm showed the maximum response. The anatase TiO 2 NP of 300 nm was the least responsive of all. The results suggest that the severity of lung inflammation is property specific; however, the underlying mechanisms (genes and pathways perturbed) leading to inflammation were the same for all particle types. While the particle size clearly influenced the overall acute lung responses, a combination of small size, crystalline structure and hydrophilic surface contributed to the long-term pathological effects observed at the highest dose (486 µg/mouse). Although the dose at which the pathological changes were observed is considered physiologically high, the study highlights the disease potential of certain TiO 2 NPs of specific properties.","Globally, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) are among the most widely produced and used nanomaterials (NMs). The estimated global annual production of TiO 2 NPs is currently near 12,500 tons (1, 2) . This value is expected to reach 2.5 million metric tons by 2025 (3) . Owing to their unique physico-chemical properties, TiO 2 NPs are used in diverse applications including consumer, industrial and biomedical fields. The extensive synthesis and pervasive use of TiO 2 NPs has resulted in unprecedented avenues for human exposure to these materials in the environment and through the use of consumer products. Exposure to TiO 2 NPs via inhalation leads to pulmonary inflammation, emphysema and lung injury in experimental rodents (4, 5) . Due to their nanosize, TiO 2 NPs penetrate deep into the highly vascularised areas of lungs and persist in lungs for weeks after the last exposure (6) . In addition, TiO 2 NPs deposited in rodent lungs translocate to blood, liver, heart, lymph nodes, spleen and other organs (7) (8) (9) (10) . These results imply that exposure to TiO 2 NPs can negatively impact health of the organisms exposed."
Two RNA-binding sites in plant fibrillarin provide interactions with various RNA substrates,"Fibrillarin, one of the major proteins of the nucleolus, plays several essential roles in ribosome biogenesis including pre-rRNA processing and 2 0 -O-ribose methylation of rRNA and snRNAs. Recently, it has been shown that fibrillarin plays a role in virus infections and is associated with viral RNPs. Here, we demonstrate the ability of recombinant fibrillarin 2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFib2) to interact with RNAs of different lengths and types including rRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, siRNA and viral RNAs in vitro. Our data also indicate that AtFib2 possesses two RNA-binding sites in the central (138-179 amino acids) and C-terminal (225-281 amino acids) parts of the protein, respectively. The conserved GCVYAVEF octamer does not bind RNA directly as suggested earlier, but may assist with the proper folding of the central RNA-binding site.","Fibrillarin is a 33-36 kDa nucleolar protein involved in multiple aspects of RNA biogenesis. It is a major protein in the fibrillar regions of the nucleolus where rRNA transcription and early pre-rRNA processing take place (1, 2) . Fibrillarin is also found in Cajal bodies (CBs), subnuclear dynamic particles that contain distinct components involved in RNA transcription and editing such as mRNA splicing and small nuclear/nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (sn/snoRNP) biogenesis (3, 4) . Fibrillarin is a core component of box C/D snoRNP particles, which are responsible for site-specific 2 0 -O-ribose methylation of rRNA and for pre-rRNA cleavage, and box C/D-containing small CB-specific RNPs (scaRNPs) that methylate snRNAs (5, 6) . Assembled sn/snoRNPs traffic through CBs before accumulating in both splicing speckles (sites of storage/assembly of splicing factors/complexes) and also in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus where early pre-rRNA processing events take place. In all cases, fibrillarin is found in multi-component complexes containing RNA (snoRNA, pre-rRNA) and proteins. In eukaryotes, the mature box C/D snoRNP complex competent for snRNA/pre-rRNA modification contains the RNA-binding 15.5-kDa protein and the two related proteins Nop56 and Nop58 in addition to fibrillarin and the snoRNA (5) ."
,"Background and Purpose Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has a high mortality rate and pandemic potential. However, the neurological manifestations of MERS have rarely been reported since it first emerged in 2012.","Since the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 1,826 laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented in 27 countries, and 35.5% of these patients have died from this novel virus. 1,2 In May 2015, the Republic of Korea suffered the largest outbreak of MERS outside of the Middle East, in which 186 patients were infected and 38 deaths were confirmed. 3 Patients with MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infections typically exhibit fever, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea, which typically proceed to pneumonia. Although some infections are asymptomatic, many cases present with severe symptoms that can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death. 4 MERS-CoV is in the Betacoronavirus genus, whose species are known to be potentially neuroinvasive. 5 However, very little information is currently available on the neurological manifestations of MERS and their incidence rates. A retrospective study in Saudi Arabia found that 25.7% of MERS patients developed confusion and 8.6% experienced a seizure. 6 Only four cases with central nervous system involvement (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, stroke, and encephali-Jee-Eun Kim a Jae-Hyeok Heo a Hye-ok Kim b Sook-hee Song b Sang-Soon Park a Tai-Hwan Park a Jin-Young Ahn a Min-Ky Kim a Jae-Phil Choi c JCN tis) and one case with critical-illness polyneuropathy have been reported for patients with MERS. 7, 8 Here we describe four patients with neurological manifestations that developed while they were being treated for MERS at a single hospital designated to treat MERS during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea."
In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus,"Objective: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.","Toward the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with human-to-human transmission and severe human infection, originating in Wuhan, China, was identified [1] . This virus has affected many persons in China and spread to other countries in a very short time. On January 30, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and issued temporary recommendations under the International Health Regulations [2] . According to the Daily Report of China National Health Commission, as of this writing on February 2, 2020, 14,488 cases, including 304 deaths, have been confirmed in China; 146 cases, including 1 death, have also been reported among 23 other countries. This pandemic is still ongoing, so it is urgent to find new preventive and therapeutic agents as soon as possible. In addition, commensurate with the risk, strong measures for early detection, isolation and treatment of cases, as well as minimization of transmission through social interaction must be implemented."
Phylogenetic Analysis of Astrovirus and Kobuvirus in Korean Dogs,"Astroviruses and kobuviruses are frequently found in mammalian feces, including that of humans. The present study examined fecal samples from 91 Korean dogs suffering from diarrhea. Canine astroviruses (CAstVs) and canine kobuviruses (CKoVs) were identified in 2 (2.1%) and 46 (50.6%) dogs, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis coupled with phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method showed that CAstVs clustered into four genetically diverse groups. Two Korean CAstVs belonged to group 2 alongside strains isolated in Italy and France. Twelve of the Korean CKoVs belonged to a single clade, along with strain UK003 identified in the UK and six CKoVs identified in the USA. Thus, the results suggest that the Korean strain of CAstV is closely related to strains isolated in Europe. Surely, CKoV in South Korea could identify the circulation among dogs population.","Astroviruses (AstVs) are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that were first identified in 1975 in samples taken from children suffering from diarrhea [1, 18] . In 1980, astrovirus-like particles (subsequently named canine astrovirus (CAstV)) were observed electron microscopically in diarrhea samples taken from beagle puppies [29] and in the feces of asymptomatic dogs [14] . Since then, there have been reports of CAstV in dogs in the U.S.A., Germany, Austria, Italy, China, France and Brazil [4, 7, 14, [27] [28] [29] 31] ; however, little is known about the clinical symptoms associated with CAstV infection."

Adenovirus is a well-known pathogen of mild upper Clinical Features and Radiological Findings of Adenovirus Pneumonia Associated with Progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Single Center Study in 19 Adult Patients,"To describe radiologic findings of adenovirus pneumonia and to understand clinico-radiological features associated with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with adenovirus pneumonia. Materials and Methods: This study included 19 patients diagnosed with adenovirus pneumonia at a tertiary referral center, in the period between March 2003 and April 2015. Clinical findings were reviewed, and two radiologists assessed imaging findings by consensus. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Student's t tests were used for comparing patients with and without subsequent development of ARDS. Results: Of 19 patients, nine were immunocompromised, and 10 were immunocompetent. Twelve patients (63%) progressed to ARDS, six of whom (32%) eventually died from the disease. The average time for progression to ARDS from symptom onset was 9.6 days. Initial chest radiographic findings were normal (n = 2), focal opacity (n = 9), or multifocal or diffuse opacity (n = 8). Computed tomography (CT) findings included bilateral (n = 17) or unilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacity with consolidation (n = 14) or pleural effusion (n = 11). Patients having subsequent ARDS had a higher probability of pleural effusion and a higher total CT extent compared with the non-ARDS group (p = 0.010 and 0.007, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in clinical variables such as patient age and premorbid condition. Conclusion: Adenovirus pneumonia demonstrates high rates of ARDS and mortality, regardless of patient age and premorbid conditions, in the tertiary care setting. Large disease extent and presence of pleural effusion on CT are factors suggestive of progression to ARDS.","described (6) (7) (8) (9) . These cases have raised concerns about adenovirus infection in the general population, but there is still limited information on the condition."
Viral evasion of DNA-stimulated innate immune responses,"Cellular sensing of virus-derived nucleic acids is essential for early defenses against virus infections. In recent years, the discovery of DNA sensing proteins, including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and gamma-interferoninducible protein (IFI16), has led to understanding of how cells evoke strong innate immune responses against incoming pathogens carrying DNA genomes. The signaling stimulated by DNA sensors depends on the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), to enable expression of antiviral proteins, including type I interferon.","Mammalian cells express pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and are therefore able to detect microbes. The PRRs are activated upon binding to conserved molecular structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), to induce expression of antiviral and proinflammatory proteins. 1,2 The fact that most PAMPs are expressed only by microbes and not by host cells, allows the innate immune system to respond specifically to non-self. In addition to pathogen-specific PAMPs, DNA is a potent stimulator of antimicrobial responses. 1, 3 To discriminate between DNA derived from the microbes versus the host, DNA sensors are present in the cytosol, as well as in endosomal membrane structures, that is, compartments expected to be free of host DNA."

In addition to the high physical strain of caring for patients potentially infected with MERS, healthcare workers face a tremendous mental burden in doing so, particularly given that the mortality rate of MERS is high, at 36% (namely, one out of 3 patients die). 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that MERS, which is caused by a strain of corona virus (called MERS-CoV), is ""a threat to the entire world"". 2 The MERS is highly contagious through direct contact with infected patients. Globally, the WHO has reported 1,621 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, and there have been nearly 584 deaths related to MERS-CoV since September 2012. 3 The first case was reported in 2012 in Jeddah, the Kingdom of KSA, wherein the MERS-CoV was detected in the sputum of a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure. 4 Apart from KSA, nearly 22 countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have confirmed MERS cases. 3 The clinical presentation of MERS ranges from mild flu-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory illness and death; mortality is especially common among patients with comorbidities. Recent epidemiological research has highlighted a number of psychiatric morbidities associated with exposure to devastating epidemics of novel and highly lethal viruses. 5, 6 For medical professionals, the psychological effects of such exposure can jeopardize the medical care they provide. This highlights the need to review the Saudi health care system and policies related to infection control. In the present study, we describe medical residents' emotions, attitude, and perceptions related to an MERS outbreak. Several past studies have examined this for similar, equally threatening, outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 5,6 and influenza, 7 but never for an MERS outbreak. Understanding the fears, anxieties, and reactions of medical residents in close contact with MERS patients may help in devising better personal and family support for hospital employees, which will ultimately aid residents in facing the MERS crisis."
Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research,"Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first reported in November 2002 in China, and spreads to about 30 countries over the next few months. While the characteristics of epidemic transmission are individually assessed, there are also important implicit associations between them.","Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus known as SARSassociated coronavirus, SARS-CoV. 1, 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; of these, 774 people died. SARS quickly obtained the status of the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. 3, 4 In this work we focus on the SARS epidemic in the city of Beijing (China) during the year 2003. SARS usually spreads by person-to-person transmission. The virus transmits most readily by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his/her mouth, nose or eyes. In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known. 5 Naturally, composite space-time variations, disease parameters and determinants ( proximity to infected persons, population density, number of doctors, etc.) are essential features of the SARS epidemic. 6 Understanding these features is critical for the scientific representation of the epidemic and the efficient control of its transmission."

Quantifying Pathogen Surveillance Using Temporal Genomic Data,"With the advent of deep sequencing, genomic surveillance has become a popular method for detection of infectious disease, supplementing information gathered by classic clinical or serological techniques to identify host-determinant markers and trace the origin of transmission. However, two main factors complicate genomic surveillance. First, pathogens exhibiting high genetic diversity demand higher levels of scrutiny to obtain an accurate representation of the entire population. Second, current systems of detection are nonuniform, with significant gaps in certain geographic locations and animal reservoirs. Despite past unforeseen pandemics like the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, there is no standardized way of evaluating surveillance. A more complete surveillance system should capture a greater proportion of pathogen diversity. Here we present a novel quantitative method of assessing the completeness of genomic surveillance that incorporates the time of sequence collection, as well as the pathogen's evolutionary rate. We propose the q2 coefficient, which measures the proportion of sequenced isolates whose closest neighbor in the past is within a genetic distance equivalent to 2 years of evolution, roughly the median time of changing strain selection for influenza A vaccines. Easily interpretable and significantly faster than other methods, the q2 coefficient requires no full phylogenetic characterization or use of arbitrary clade definitions. Application of the q2 coefficient to influenza A virus confirmed poor sampling of swine and avian populations and identified regions with deficient surveillance. We demonstrate that the q2 coefficient can not only be applied to other pathogens, including dengue and West Nile viruses, but also used to describe surveillance dynamics, particularly the effects of different public health policies. IMPORTANCE Surveillance programs have become key assets in determining the emergence or prevalence of pathogens circulating in human and animal populations. Genomic surveillance, in particular, provides comprehensive information on the history of isolates and potential molecular markers for infectivity and pathogenicity. Current techniques for evaluating genomic surveillance are inaccurate, ignoring the pathogen's evolutionary rate and biodiversity, as well as the timing of sequence collection. Using sequence data, we propose the q2 coefficient as a quantitative measure of surveillance completeness that combines elements of time and evolution without defining arbitrary criteria for clades or species. Through several case studies of influenza A, dengue, and West Nile viruses, we employed the q2 coefficient to identify sampling deficiencies in different host species and locations, as well as examine the effects of different public health policies through historical records of the q2 coefficient. These results can guide public health agencies to focus resource allocation and virus collection to bolster specific problems in surveillance.","D espite many therapeutic and epidemiological advances, infectious diseases-the number one cause of death among children-remain directly responsible for roughly 15 million (Ͼ25%) of the annual deaths that occur worldwide (1) . Of particular concern are emerging infections (EIs) that include novel entities like HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome and previously existing but rapidly spreading diseases like cholera and the plague (2, 3) . Zoonosis is a rich source of such EI transmission into human hosts (4) , suggesting that pathogen surveillance of animals, as well as humans, is an important method of early detection of potential outbreaks and of capturing the entire biodiversity of a pathogen population at any given place and time."

Towards the Application of Human Defensins as Antivirals Park et al. Human Defensins as Antivirals,"Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that participate in the innate immunity of hosts. Humans constitutively and/or inducibly express α-and β-defensins, which are known for their antiviral and antibacterial activities. This review describes the application of human defensins. We discuss the extant experimental results, limited though they are, to consider the potential applicability of human defensins as antiviral agents. Given their antiviral effects, we propose that basic research be conducted on human defensins that focuses on RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and dengue virus (DENV), which are considered serious human pathogens but have posed huge challenges for vaccine development for different reasons. Concerning the prophylactic and therapeutic applications of defensins, we then discuss the applicability of human defensins as antivirals that has been demonstrated in reports using animal models. Finally, we discuss the potential adjuvant-like activity of human defensins and propose an exploration of the 'defensin vaccine' concept to prime the body with a controlled supply of human defensins. In sum, we suggest a conceptual framework to achieve the practical application of human defensins to combat viral infections.","Knowledge of how organisms defend themselves from other organisms has accumulated as the biological sciences have progressed. Currently, the concepts of 'innate' and 'adaptive' defense mechanisms are used to describe all of the complex and multi-layered biological conflicts between invading and host organisms. Defensins are innate defense molecules of ancient origin that can be traced back to organisms from approximately 500 million years ago (Erwin and Davidson, 2002; Phoenix et al., 2013; Zhu and Gao, 2013) . The history of the discovery of human defensins has been reviewed elsewhere (Boman, 2003; Lehrer, 2004; Phoenix et al., 2013) . In this review, we focus on studies contributing to the practical application of human defensins as antivirals."
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins e27454-1 Intrinsically Disordered Proteins 1,These authors contributed equally to this work.,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are found extensively throughout all proteomes, and this typically has a significant bearing on functional and structural considerations. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Computational and experimental methods for identifying disorder in proteins continue to undergo rapid advancement. [13] [14] [15] Also, there is ongoing debate regarding the application of alternate models of protein behavior such as induced fit, conformational selection and fuzzy complexes. [16] [17] [18] Despite this activity, the field is still nascent and the implications of intrinsic disorder on function, binding mechanisms, drug-design and disease propensity are often not mentioned or considered in the literature. As an example, performing a search within this quarter on 2 proteins known to be disordered, we find that 8 out of 213 published papers on α-Synuclein and 9 out of 965 papers on amyloid β include the terms ""intrinsically disordered protein"" or ""natively unfolded protein. "" Here are details and outputs of these searches: ((intrinsically disordered protein) OR (natively unfolded protein)) AND Keeping up with the field represents a challenge due to increasing awareness and use of the term and the breadth of coverage across multiple disciplines in the literature. The purpose of this digest is to provide an unbiased and condensed survey of the literature on a quarterly basis. Based on the reported metrics, the first issue of the Disorder Digest 19 gained significant attention of readers (as of November 2013, this article, being published at the end of June 2013, was viewed 435 times), suggesting that the idea of having condensed overview of intrinsic disorder-related literature is welcome."
Enforced microglial depletion and repopulation as a promising strategy for the treatment of neurological disorders,"Microglia are prominent immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are critical players in both neurological development and homeostasis, and in neurological diseases when dysfunctional. Our previous understanding of the phenotypes and functions of microglia has been greatly extended by a dearth of recent investigations. Distinct genetically defined subsets of microglia are now recognized to perform their own independent functions in specific conditions. The molecular profiling of single microglial cells indicates extensively heterogeneous reactions in different neurological disorders, resulting in multiple potentials for crosstalk with other kinds of CNS cells such as astrocytes and neurons. In settings of neurological diseases it could thus be prudent to establish effective cell-based therapies by targeting entire microglial networks. Notably, activated microglial depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological therapies within a suitable time window can stimulate replenishment of the CNS niche with new microglia. Additionally, enforced repopulation through provision of replacement cells also represents a potential means of exchanging dysfunctional with functional microglia. In each setting the newly repopulated microglia might have the potential to resolve ongoing neuroinflammation. In this review, we aim to summarize the most recent knowledge of microglia and to highlight microglial depletion and subsequent repopulation as a promising cell replacement therapy. Although glial cell replacement therapy is still in its infancy and future translational studies are still required, the approach is scientifically sound and provides new optimism for managing the neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia. K E Y W O R D S cell replacement therapy, depletion, microglia, neuroinflammation","documented that microglia can be self-regulated without contribution from peripheral myeloid cells and their turnover is tightly controlled by the coupling of apoptosis, with approximately 1% murine microglia dying in 1 day and the whole population of cells renewing several times throughout life (Askew et al., 2017; Tay et al., 2017) . Although significant species differences in microglial biology such as microglial density were noted, this finding also concords with observations in humans, a recent study highlighting that more than 96% of human microglia can be slowly renewed throughout life (Reu et al., 2017) ."
Establishment of minimal positive-control conditions to ensure brain safety during rapid development of emergency vaccines,"With the increase in international human and material exchanges, contagious and infectious epidemics are occurring. One of the effective methods of epidemic inhibition is the rapid development and supply of vaccines. Considering the safety of the brain during vaccine development is very important. However, manuals for brain safety assays for new vaccines are not uniform or effective globally. Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish a positive-control protocol for an effective brain safety test to enhance rapid vaccine development. The blood-brain barrier's tight junctions provide selective defense of the brain; however, it is possible to destroy these important microstructures by administering lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), thereby artificially increasing the permeability of brain parenchyma. In this study, test conditions are established so that the degree of brain penetration or brain destruction of newly developed vaccines can be quantitatively identified. The most effective conditions were suggested by measuring time-dependent expressions of tight junction biomarkers (zonula occludens-1 [ZO-1] and occludin) in two types of mice (C57BL/6 and ICR) following exposure to two types of LPS (Salmonella and Escherichia). In the future, we hope that use of the developed positive-control protocol will help speed up the determination of brain safety of novel vaccines.","In the 21st century, various infectious diseases threaten humans and animals around the world due to ever-increasing global movements of people, animals, and materials [19, 23] . Nonetheless, the most effective way of approaching an epidemic that occurs at unexpected times and or in unexpected places is to rapidly supply vaccines related to the infectious diseases within a limited time [15] . However, during rapid vaccine developments performed to date, there has been little consideration given to establishing a precise protocol for ensuring brain safety. This oversight in the development of general and/or emergent vaccines should be corrected by developing an effective safety protocol that can reduce brain damage risks before distribution of the vaccine. The present study was undertaken to establish a protocol that can be used to determine if a material, such as a vaccine, will damage the brain by breaking down the brain-protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). Since the BBB is a critical morphological structure with selective permeability between blood vessels and brain tissue, it is very important to determine the conditions that can make the BBB vulnerable; for example, exposure to a pyrogenic inflammatory agent such as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered via systemic injection [10] . To ensure the brain safety of newly developed vaccines and to establish positive-control conditions for use in a vaccine safety protocol, we used the specificity of brain anatomical structures to investigate the robustness of the BBB by varying LPS exposure times (0, 2, 4, and 24 h) in two different mouse strains (C57BL/6 and ICR). In this study, we describe an effective positive-control protocol for were tested in two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 [B6] and ICR). The intraperitoneally administered EB (4 mL/kg, 2% [w/v] in phosphate buffered saline [PBS]; pH 7.4) appeared in the homogenized brains following the injection of LPS(S) or LPS(E) in the different mice strains. Compared to the control group administered with vehicle (PBS) only, the amount of EB that penetrated the brain was significantly higher in both mouse strains after injection with both LPSs. Interestingly, for both LPSs the amounts of EB penetrating ICR mouse brains were greater than those of B6 mouse brains, and for both mouse strains the amount of EB penetrance was greater in LPS(S) than in LPS(E). assessing the brain safety of vaccines that will be developed and supplied in the future. The protocol may develop into a complete safety assurance protocol in the future."
Molecules and Cells Supplementary Materials,MBP-tagged TRIM25 protein was expressed in E.coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) TM cells (Millipore).,"To identify the aptamer binding region on NS1, ELISA was performed as described in Materials and Methods, with slight modifications. GST-tagged RBD (2-73 amino acids), ED (72-230 amino acids), and mutants (K41A and K41A/R38A) of the NS1 protein were purified as described previously (Woo et al., 2013) . 3�-Biotinylated RNA aptamers were synthesized by terminal transferase using Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) (Rosemeyer et al., 1995) . A streptavidin-coated plate was incubated with 100 μl/well of the selected 3�-biotinylated aptamer (100 nM in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBST for 1 h and further incubated with 100 μl/well of truncated and mutant NS1 proteins (full length, RBD, ED, R38A mutant, and R38A/K41A double mutant at 100 nM in PBS)"
In-cell infection: a novel pathway for Epstein-Barr virus infection mediated by cell-in-cell structures,"of NPEC1-Bmi1 cells, an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. Furthermore, efficient infection by this mechanism involved the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, our study identified ""in-cell infection"" as a novel mechanism for EBV infection. Given the diversity of virus-infected cells and the prevalence of cell-in-cell structures during chronic infection, we speculate that ""in-cell infection"" is likely a general mechanism for EBV and other viruses to infect non-susceptible ECs.","Viral infections remain a threat to global health and cause either acute fatal diseases such as Ebola [1] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [2] or chronic diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [3] and hepatitis B [4] . Moreover, certain persistent viral infections have been implicated in tumorigenesis, like cervical carcinoma caused by human papillomavirus [5] or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Burkitt's lymphoma by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [6, 7] . Viral infection displays strict species and cell type specificity, a definition called viral tropism [8] , which is crucial in determining the manifestation and outcome of viral infection [9] [10] [11] . However, not rare but quite often, viruses gain the ability to infect non-susceptible cells, as shown by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the genital and gastrointestinal cells [12, 13] , making the clinical prophylaxis and therapy more complex. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms of virus tropism are critical for developing alternative anti-virus strategies [14, 15] ."
"Genetic, Transcriptome, Proteomic, and Epidemiological Evidence for Blood- Brain Barrier Disruption and Polymicrobial Brain Invasion as Determinant Factors in Alzheimer's Disease","Diverse pathogens are detected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. A bioinformatics survey showed that AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) genes (localized in bone marrow, immune locations and microglia) relate to multiple host/pathogen interactomes (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Bornavirus, Borrelia burgdorferri, cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus, HSV-1, HERV-W, HIV-1, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, influenza, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Porphyrymonas gingivalis, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi). These interactomes also relate to the AD hippocampal transcriptome and to plaque or tangle proteins. Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match those upregulated by multiple bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa in immunocompetent cells. AD genes are enriched in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection for pathogen resistance, as supported by the old age of AD patients, implying resistance to earlier infections. APOE4 is concentrated in regions of high parasitic burden and protects against childhood tropical infections and hepatitis C. Immune/inflammatory gain of function applies to APOE4, CR1, and TREM2 variants. AD genes are also expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is disrupted by AD risk factors (age, alcohol, aluminum, concussion, cerebral hypoperfusion, diabetes, homocysteine, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, pesticides, pollution, physical inactivity, sleep disruption, smoking) and by pathogens, directly or via olfactory routes to basal-forebrain BBB control centers. The BBB benefits from statins, NSAIDs, estrogen, melatonin, memantine, and the Mediterranean diet. Polymicrobial involvement is supported by upregulation of bacterial, viral, and fungal sensors/defenders in the AD brain, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid. AD serum amyloid-␤ autoantibodies may attenuate its antimicrobial effects favoring microbial survival and cerebral invasion leading to activation of neurodestructive immune/inflammatory processes, which may also be augmented by age-related immunosenescence. AD may thus respond to antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral therapy. association of AD with spirochetal (Odds ratio (OR) = 10.61) or Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection (OR = 5.66) [1] and association of herpes simplex (HSV-1) infection with AD, which is augmented by possession of the APOE4 allele (OR = 2.71) [2] . Periodontitis has also been associated with AD (meta-analysis OR = 1.69 for all periodontitis, and 2.98 for severe periodontitis) [3] and is associated with increased amyloid-␤ (A␤) load","Multiple and diverse pathogens, have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in epidemiological studies. Meta-analysis studies have reported the immunity-related responses but also results in increases in inflammatory reactions termed ""inflamm-aging"" [31, 32] . The control of the BBB, the routes of pathogen entry and immunosenescence are covered in greater detail in a later section."
Sendai virus intra-host population dynamics and host immunocompetence influence viral virulence during in vivo passage,"In vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence, and although the precise mechanism(s) are not clear, it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity. Under-or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.","Novel human viral pathogens are emerging with increasing frequency, however the mechanisms of viral adaptation to a new host are not well understood (Morse, et al. 2012; Anthony et al. 2013) .

Original Article Clinical Microbiology External Quality Assessment of MERS-CoV Molecular Diagnostics During the 2015 Korean Outbreak,"Background: The largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outside Middle East Asia in 2015 has necessitated the rapid expansion of laboratories that conduct MERS-CoV molecular testing in Korea, together with external quality assessment (EQA) to evaluate the assays used.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel human pathogen associated with severe respiratory illness and was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1, 2] . The confirmatory MERS-CoV test recommended by WHO is based on the real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) of two different targets-an upstream region of the envelope gene (upE; the firstline screening) and a region within the open reading frame (ORF)1a-plus sequencing of the nucleocapsid (N) gene or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene for confirmation [3] [4] [5] ."
Relationship between the Clinical Characteristics and Intervention Scores of Infants with Apparent Life-threatening Events,"We investigated the clinical presentations, diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, and prognosis from follow-up of infants with apparent life-threatening events (ALTE). In addition, the relationship between the clinical characteristics of patients and significant intervention scores was analyzed. We enrolled patients younger than 12 months who were diagnosed with ALTE from January 2005 to December 2012. There were 29 ALTE infants with a peak incidence of age younger than 1 month (48.3%). The most common symptoms for ALTE diagnosis were apnea (69.0%) and color change (58.6%). Eleven patients appeared normal upon arrival at hospital but 2 patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the initial ALTE. The most common ALTE cause was respiratory disease, including respiratory infection and upper airway anomalies (44.8%). There were 20 cases of repeat ALTE and 2 cases of death during hospitalization. Four patients (15.4%) experienced recurrence of ALTE after discharge and 4 patients (15.4%) showed developmental abnormalities during the follow-up period. The patients with ALTE during sleep had lower significant intervention scores (P = 0.015) compared to patients with ALTE during wakefulness and patients with previous respiratory symptoms had higher significant intervention scores (P = 0.013) than those without previous respiratory symptoms.","Since the 1970s, many investigators have focused on episodes occurring in infants characterized by an acute and unexpected change in behavior either with or without apnea. These episodes were referred to as ""near-misses"" for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (1), and considered a possible cause of SIDS. In 1986, the National Institutes of Health consensus conference named these episodes apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) and defined them using the following criteria: some combination of central or obstructive apnea; color change; marked change in muscle tone; and choking or gagging (2) . It is a frightening event, occurring predominantly in infancy and accounting for 0.6%-1.7% of all emergency department (ED) visits for infants younger than 1 yr of age and 0.5%-6% of all infant visits (3) (4) (5) (6) . It is associated with a 0%-6% mortality rate (2) ."
Systems-Based Analysis of the Sarcocystis neurona Genome Identifies Pathways That Contribute to a Heteroxenous Life Cycle,"Sarcocystis neurona is a member of the coccidia, a clade of single-celled parasites of medical and veterinary importance including Eimeria, Sarcocystis, Neospora, and Toxoplasma. Unlike Eimeria, a single-host enteric pathogen, Sarcocystis, Neospora, and Toxoplasma are two-host parasites that infect and produce infectious tissue cysts in a wide range of intermediate hosts. As a genus, Sarcocystis is one of the most successful protozoan parasites; all vertebrates, including birds, reptiles, fish, and mammals are hosts to at least one Sarcocystis species. Here we sequenced Sarcocystis neurona, the causal agent of fatal equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. The S. neurona genome is 127 Mbp, more than twice the size of other sequenced coccidian genomes. Comparative analyses identified conservation of the invasion machinery among the coccidia. However, many densegranule and rhoptry kinase genes, responsible for altering host effector pathways in Toxoplasma and Neospora, are absent from S. neurona. Further, S. neurona has a divergent repertoire of SRS proteins, previously implicated in tissue cyst formation in Toxoplasma. Systems-based analyses identified a series of metabolic innovations, including the ability to exploit alternative sources of energy. Finally, we present an S. neurona model detailing conserved molecular innovations that promote the transition from a purely enteric lifestyle (Eimeria) to a heteroxenous parasite capable of infecting a wide range of intermediate hosts.","To survive and persist in their respective hosts, apicomplexan parasites have evolved a variety of molecular strategies. These include a group of specialized proteins that facilitate parasite entry, egress, and colonization, as well as molecular decoys that modulate host immune signaling (4, 5) . The majority of these proteins localize to exocytic organelles (micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules) that discharge in a highly coordinated program of invasion (5) . For Toxoplasma gondii, initial host recognition and attachment are performed by members of the SAG1-related sequence (SRS) family. This is followed by secretion of the microneme (MIC) proteins that strengthen host cell attachment and result in the formation of a ""moving junction"" that provides the motive force required to penetrate the host cell. The moving junction is further controlled by a set of proteins known as rhoptry neck (RON) proteins that facilitate invasion (for a review, see reference 6). Subsequently, rhoptry (ROP) proteins and densegranule (GRA) proteins are secreted into the host cytosol to interact with cellular targets to protect the (now) intracellular parasite from clearance. The parasite is further protected through encasement within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is, interestingly, absent from the schizont form of Sarcocystis."
Coordination among tertiary base pairs results in an efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot,"Frameshifting is an essential process that regulates protein synthesis in many viruses. The ribosome may slip backward when encountering a frameshift motif on the messenger RNA, which usually contains a pseudoknot structure involving tertiary base pair interactions. Due to the lack of detailed molecular explanations, previous studies investigating which features of the pseudoknot are important to stimulate frameshifting have presented diverse conclusions. Here we constructed a bimolecular pseudoknot to dissect the interior tertiary base pairs and used single-molecule approaches to assess the structure targeted by ribosomes. We found that the first ribosome target stem was resistant to unwinding when the neighboring loop was confined along the stem; such constrained conformation was dependent on the presence of consecutive adenosines in this loop. Mutations that disrupted the distal base triples abolished all remaining tertiary base pairs. Changes in frameshifting efficiency correlated with the stem unwinding resistance. Our results demonstrate that various tertiary base pairs are coordinated inside a highly efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot and suggest a mechanism by which mechanical resistance of the pseudoknot may persistently act on translocating ribosomes.","Translation is the process of protein synthesis catalyzed by ribosomes. The ribosome reads consecutive codons along the messenger RNA (mRNA) until reaching a stop codon, which marks the end of translation. A codon consists of three nucleotides, and thus there are three possible reading frames for a given mRNA. Under some circumstances, the ribosome may move from one frame to another during translation by skipping or rereading a nucleotide of the mRNA, resulting in +1 or −1 frameshifting, respectively. Minus-one frameshifting is commonly used to regulate the relative expression levels of two proteins in many viruses and bacteria, where specific mRNA sequences and structures are devised to stimulate frameshifting with a certain efficiency, a process termed programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) (1) (2) (3) (4) ."
"Distribution of the COVID-19 Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak is spreading in China, but it has not yet reached its peak. Five million people emigrated from Wuhan before lockdown, potentially representing a source of virus infection. Determining case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early stage of the epidemic is of great importance for early warning and for the prevention of future outbreaks.","Emerging infectious diseases are a major challenge in the 21st century. In recent years, worldwide outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused great health and economic losses. [1, 2] The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak is becoming a global public health problem. The COVID-19 outbreak is highly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred in 2003; both outbreaks were caused by new coronaviruses during time periods overlapping with the Chinese Spring Festival. [3] On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee reported 27 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and many cases were traced to the Wuhan Southern China Seafood Market, which was subsequently closed on January 1, 2020. [4] On January 7, 2020, laboratory tests showed that the pathogen causing the previously unexplained pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus; this pneumonia was then officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). [5, 6] The COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other provinces and countries. [7, 8] As of January 30, 2020, a total of 34 provinces and regions in China had reported 9692 cases, and nearly all imported cases were derived from Wuhan in Hubei province. [9, 10] COVID-19 has been defined as a class B infectious disease but has been managed as a class A infectious disease by the Chinese government. Daily case reports are being released, and any omission or concealment is punishable by law. Currently, the number of cases is still increasing, and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak; however, the situation differs from province to province. Information on the temporal and spatial distributions of cases is important for developing targeted treatment and prevention strategies. Because the return peak of Spring Festival travel is approaching, information on the possible changes in the incidence of COVID-19 in different cities will help in better preparation for disease prevention and management. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the temporal and spatial distributions of the early COVID-19 epidemic to reveal the dynamic changes and trends in reported cases. These results will provide valuable information for disease prevention at both the individual and organization levels."
Oligomerized Transferrin Receptors Are Selectively Retained by a Lumenal Sorting Signal in a Long-lived Endocytic Recycling Compartment,"Cross-linking of surface receptors results in 1.

To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which receptor cross-linking affects the intracellular trafficking of both ligand and receptor, we studied the intracellular trafficking of the transferrin receptor (TfR) bound to multivalent-transferrin (Tfl0) which was prepared by chemical cross-linking of transferrin (Tf). Tfl0 was internalized about two times slower than Tf and was retained four times longer than Tf, without being degraded in CHO cells. The intracellular localization of Tfl0 was investigated using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Tfl0 was not delivered to the lysosomal pathway followed by low density lipoprotein but remained accessible to Tf in the pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment for at least 60 min. The retained Tfl0 was TfR-associated as demonstrated by a reduction in surface TfR number when cells were incubated with Tfl0. The presence of Tfx0 within the recycling compartment did not affect trafficking of subsequently endocytosed Tf. Retention of Tfl0 within the recycling compartment did not require the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR since Tfl0 exited cells with the same rate when bound to the wild-type TfR or a mutated receptor with only four amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail. Thus, cross-linking of surface receptors by a multivalent ligand acts as a lumenal retention signal within the recycling compartment. The data presented here show that the recycling compartment labeled by Tfl0 is a long-lived organelle along the early endosome recycling pathway that remains fusion accessible to subsequently endocytosed Tf."
Biochemical Studies on Cell Fusion. II. Control of Fusion Response by Lipid Alteration,"The preceding communication (Roos, D. S. and P. W. Choppin, 1985, J. Cell Biol. 101:1578-1590 described the lipid composition of a series of mouse fibroblast cell lines which vary in susceptibility to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Two alterations in lipid content were found to be directly correlated with resistance to PEG-induced cell fusion: increases in fatty acyl chain saturation, and the elevation of neutral glycerides, including an unusual ether-linked compound. In this study, we have probed the association between lipid composition and cell fusion through the use of fatty acid supplements to the cellular growth medium, and show that the fusibility of cells can be controlled by altering their acyl chain composition. The parental Clone 1D cells contain moderately unsaturated fatty acids with a ratio of saturates to polyunsaturates (S/P) ,~ 1, and fuse virtually to completion following a standard PEG treatment. By contrast, the lipids of a highly fusion-resistant mutant cell line, F40, are highly saturated (S/P = 4). When the S/P ratio of Clone 1D cells was increased to approximate that normally found in F40 cells by growth in the presence of high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, they became highly resistant to PEG. Reduction of the S/P ratio of F40 cells by growth in cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids rendered them susceptible to fusion. Cell lines Fa, F16, etc., which are normally intermediate between Clone 1D and F40 in both lipid composition and fusion response, can be altered in either direction (towards either increased or decreased susceptibility to fusion) by the addition of appropriate fatty acids to the growth medium. Although trans-unsaturated fatty acids have phase-transition temperatures roughly similar to saturated compounds, and might therefore be expected to affect membrane fluidity in a similar manner, trans-unsaturated fatty acids exerted the same effect as cisunsaturates on the control of PEG-induced cell fusion. This observation suggests that the control of cell fusion by alteration of fatty acid content is not due to changes in membrane fluidity, and thus that the fatty acids are involved in some other way in the modulation of cell fusion.","ABSTRACT The preceding communication (Roos, D.

Spread of Mutant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus with Reduced Affinity to Human CD26 during the South Korean Outbreak,"The newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a severe respiratory infection with a high mortality rate (~35%). MERS-CoV has been a global threat due to continuous outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula and international spread by infected travelers since 2012. From May to July 2015, a large outbreak initiated by an infected traveler from the Arabian peninsula swept South Korea and resulted in 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths (case fatality rate, 20.4%).","mary source of human infection (7) (8) (9) . A viral MERS-CoV spike (S) protein has been suggested to be a critical viral factor for host tropism via its interaction with a host receptor, CD26 (10, 11) , but the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV for human adaptation remains unclear. The efficacy of direct human-to-human spread in the community seems to be quite low, as the rate of human transmission among household contacts of MERS patients has been approximately 5% based on serological analysis (12) . However, ongoing sporadic outbreaks highlight the importance of early nosocomial superspreading events in secondary human infections before active case detection and implementation of interventions (13) . There were also typical superspreading events fueling the unexpected large outbreak in South Korea. The index case (patient A) returning from the Middle East generated 38 cases of secondary infections; two patients (patient D and E) of the second wave of infection or generation were linked to at least 81 and 23 cases of the third generation, respectively ( Fig. 1) (4) . The rapid and wide spread of MERS-CoV during the South Korean outbreak raised strong concerns about the possible generation of mutations with enhanced sequential human infection. In this study, we analyzed MERS-CoV genomes isolated from 13 patients admitted to Chungnam National University Hospital, one of the designated ""national safe hospitals"" during the South Korean outbreak and compared them to recently reported genomes from two South Korean patients (14, 15) and others deposited in the GenBank database."
EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE Dimethyloxaloylglycine increases bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head,"Mesenchymal stem cells have been widely studied to promote local bone regeneration of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1α protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1α expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8±7.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5±3.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2±2.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6±2.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α expression in the treatment of ONFH.","Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a pathological process primarily caused by interrupted local blood circulation, which can cause apoptosis of osteocytes and osseous tissue necrosis (1, 2) . The lack of effective therapy for ONFH is a difficulty that needs to be overcome in clinical practice. Several methods have been used to treat early-stage ONFH, such as drug therapy, core decompression, vascularized bone grafting and rotational osteotomy. However, the clinical results of these methods are not satisfactory (3, 4) ."
Co-infection with two strains of Brome mosaic bromovirus reveals common RNA recombination sites in different hosts,"We have previously reported intra-segmental crossovers in Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs. In this work, we studied the homologous recombination of BMV RNA in three different hosts: barley (Hordeum vulgare), Chenopodium quinoa, and Nicotiana benthamiana that were co-infected with two strains of BMV: Russian (R) and Fescue (F). Our work aimed at (1) establishing the frequency of recombination, (2) mapping the recombination hot spots, and (3) addressing host effects. The F and R nucleotide sequences differ from each other at many translationally silent nucleotide substitutions. We exploited this natural variability to track the crossover sites. Sequencing of a large number of cDNA clones revealed multiple homologous crossovers in each BMV RNA segment, in both the whole plants and protoplasts. Some recombination hot spots mapped at similar locations in different hosts, suggesting a role for viral factors, but other sites depended on the host. Our results demonstrate the chimeric ('mosaic') nature of the BMV RNA genome.","The exchange of genetic material generates variations among natural populations and demonstrates their role in evolution and adaptation (Awadalla 2003) . Populations of RNA viruses usually harbor genetic diversity due to high mutation rates, recombination, turnover rates, and large variability (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011). Genetic RNA recombination contributes to viral evolution and biogenesis (Koonin, Dolja, and Krupovic 2015) , evident in many groups of plus-sense RNA viruses in animals (Weiss and Schlesinger 1991; Graham and Baric 2010; Lukashev 2010) , plants (reviewed in Bujarski 2013) , and bacteria (Palasingam and Shaklee 1992) , in negativesense (Han and Worobey 2011) , double-stranded (Krupovic, Dolja, and Koonin 2015) , and retroviruses (Delviks-Frankenberry et al. 2011) , and in defective-interfering RNAs (Sandoval et al. 2008) ."

Inflammatory and microbiological associations with near-fatal asthma requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has developed as a critical tool permitting lung protection in severe respiratory failure. Its use was largely confined to acute respiratory distress syndrome [1]; however, as technology has advanced, it is now used in a range of respiratory diseases, including asthma. In the context of near-fatal asthma exacerbations, ECMO provides a management strategy for difficult-to-ventilate patients who would otherwise be unlikely to survive. Importantly, in asthma, traditional mechanical ventilation strategies can be associated with volutrauma and barotrauma due to the high pressures required in the presence of severe bronchospasm [2] . To date, there is a paucity of data for ECMO use in acute asthma and it is unknown whether specific clinical or inflammatory characteristics are associated with the need for ECMO.","incidence of positive bacterial isolates. Compared to the mechanical ventilation group, days on mechanical ventilation were significantly greater in the ECMO cohort (13±12 versus 5±8 days, p=0.006). In addition, length of stay (LoS) in the ICU (15±10 versus 5±7 days, p=0.033) and in hospital (22±17 versus 12±16 days, p<0.001) were significantly longer in the ECMO group. Higher CRP levels on admission to hospital were associated with a more prolonged hospital and ICU stay in the mechanical ventilation group only ( p<0.001). All ECMO patients survived to hospital discharge; however, two mechanically ventilated patients died during their ICU admission. In this retrospective review of adult asthmatics admitted to intensive care for a near-fatal acute exacerbation, we report that the requirement for ECMO was associated with younger age, female sex and the presence of either fungal or rhinoviral infection in the lower airway. In addition, a higher white cell count, a more profound degree of hypercapnia and acidaemia, as well as an increased LoS in the ICU and hospital overall, were observed in those requiring ECMO support."
Techno-economic analysis of a transient plant-based platform for monoclonal antibody production,"Plant-based biomanufacturing of therapeutic proteins is a relatively new platform with a small number of commercial-scale facilities, but offers advantages of linear scalability, reduced upstream complexity, reduced time to market, and potentially lower capital and operating costs. In this study we present a detailed process simulation model for a large-scale new ""greenfield"" biomanufacturing facility that uses transient agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana plants grown hydroponically indoors under lightemitting diode lighting for the production of a monoclonal antibody. The model was used to evaluate the total capital investment, annual operating cost, and cost of goods sold as a function of mAb expression level in the plant (g mAb/kg fresh weight of the plant) and production capacity (kg mAb/year). For the Base Case design scenario (300 kg mAb/year, 1 g mAb/kg fresh weight, and 65% recovery in downstream processing), the model predicts a total capital investment of $122 million dollars and cost of goods sold of $121/g including depreciation. Compared with traditional biomanufacturing platforms that use mammalian cells grown in bioreactors, the model predicts significant reductions in capital investment and >50% reduction in cost of goods compared with published values at similar production scales. The simulation model can be modified or adapted by others to assess the profitability of alternative designs, implement different process assumptions, and help guide process development and optimization.","Since the commercialization of the first therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) in 1986, this class of biopharmaceutical products has grown exponentially. As of November 2014, fortyseven mAb products have been approved in the US or Europe for the treatment of a variety of diseases, and many of these products have also been approved for other global markets. 1 At the current approval rate (an average of 4 new products per year), it is expected that over 70 mAb products will be on the market by 2020, and projected combined global sales by 2017 will be nearly $90 billion. 2 Currently, most protein-based therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines are made using traditional recombinant protein production platforms (e.g., mammalian or microbial cells cultured in stainless steel or single-use disposable bioreactor systems). The selling prices of pharmaceuticals are increasing along with global price inflation, and in turn, over half of the global population cannot afford critical medicines. Additionally, there is a growing need for manufacturing processes that can a) respond quickly to new or sudden medical needs (e.g., during the 2012-2015 Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the 2016 Zika virus outbreaks), b) offer more rapid drug development, and c) lower drug prices to address emerging markets in less-developed areas of the world."
A Correlation between the Severity of Lung Lesions on Radiographs and Clinical Findings in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,Objective: The purpose of this study was to quantify lesions on chest radiographs in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and analyze the severity of the lesions with clinical parameters.,"clinical prognostic factors of SARS (17 28) and the relationship between the imaging findings and clinical outcomes or laboratory parameters (10, 29 37) ."
Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein- Mediated Inhibition of Host Cell Entry of Ebolaviruses,"Ebolaviruses are highly pathogenic in humans and nonhuman primates and pose a severe threat to public health. The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins can restrict entry of ebolaviruses, influenza A viruses, and other enveloped viruses. However, the breadth and mechanism of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Here, we employed ebolavirus glycoprotein-pseudotyped vectors and ebolavirus-like particles to address this question. We show that IFITM proteins inhibit the cellular entry of diverse ebolaviruses and demonstrate that type I interferon induces IFITM protein expression in macrophages, major viral targets. Moreover, we show that IFITM proteins block entry of influenza A viruses and ebolaviruses by different mechanisms and provide evidence that antibodies and IFITM proteins can synergistically inhibit cellular entry of ebolaviruses. These results provide insights into the role of IFITM proteins in infection by ebolaviruses and suggest a mechanism by which antibodies, though poorly neutralizing in vitro, might contribute to viral control in vivo.","responsible for outbreaks of severe disease in sub-Saharan Africa, which are associated with high case fatality rates [2, 3] . In addition, an EBOV disease is currently ongoing in Western Africa [4] and is associated with 25 791 cases and 10 689 deaths (as of 15 April 2015) [5] . In contrast, RESTV is an Asian ebolavirus, which might be apathogenic in immunocompetent humans [6] . African [7] and Asian ebolaviruses [8] infect bats, which serve as a natural reservoir, and a related filovirus, Lloviu virus (LLOV; genus Cuevavirus), was identified in a European bat [9] . Thus, zoonotic transmission of ebolaviruses to humans can pose a significant threat to public health, and understanding virus-host cell interactions might yield insights into viral spread and pathogenesis and provide a basis for developing antiviral strategies."
Undressing of Waddlia chondrophila to enrich its outer membrane proteins to develop a new species-specific ELISA,"Waddlia chondrophila, an obligate intracellular bacterium of the Chlamydiales order, is considered as an agent of bovine abortion and a likely cause of miscarriage in humans. Its role in respiratory diseases was questioned after the detection of its DNA in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis. To better define the role of Waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia, a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity is needed. Therefore, enriched outer membrane proteins of W.","Waddlia chondrophila is a Chlamydia-related bacterium belonging to the Waddliaceae family, one of the seven families and family-level lineages classified within the Chlamydiales order. The established human pathogens of the Chlamydiaceae family (Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci) have been extensively studied, as compared to the other six families of Chlamydia-related bacteria that remain poorly investigated so far."
Identification of a Gamma Interferon-Activated Inhibitor of Translation-Like RNA Motif at the 3= End of the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Genome Modulating Innate Immune Response,"A 32-nucleotide (nt) RNA motif located at the 3= end of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome was found to specifically interact with the host proteins glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) and arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS). This RNA motif has high homology in sequence and secondary structure with the gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) element, which is located at the 3= end of several mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins. The GAIT element is involved in the translation silencing of these mRNAs through its interaction with the GAIT complex (EPRS, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q, ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) to favor the resolution of inflammation. Interestingly, we showed that the viral RNA motif bound the GAIT complex and inhibited the in vitro translation of a chimeric mRNA containing this RNA motif. To our knowledge, this is the first GAIT-like motif described in a positive RNA virus. To test the functional role of the GAIT-like RNA motif during TGEV infection, a recombinant coronavirus harboring mutations in this motif was engineered and characterized. Mutations of the GAIT-like RNA motif did not affect virus growth in cell cultures. However, an exacerbated innate immune response, mediated by the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) pathway, was observed in cells infected with the mutant virus compared with the response observed in cells infected with the parental virus. Furthermore, the mutant virus was more sensitive to beta interferon than the parental virus. All together, these data strongly suggested that the viral GAIT-like RNA motif modulates the host innate immune response. IMPORTANCE The innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense that culminates with the synthesis of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines to limit virus replication. Coronaviruses encode several proteins that interfere with the innate immune response at different levels, but to date, no viral RNA counteracting antiviral response has been described. In this work, we have characterized a 32-nt RNA motif located at the 3= end of the TGEV genome that specifically interacted with EPRS and RRS. This RNA motif presented high homology with the GAIT element, involved in the modulation of the inflammatory response. Moreover, the disruption of the viral GAIT-like RNA motif led to an exacerbated innate immune response triggered by MDA5, indicating that the GAIT-like RNA motif counteracts the host innate immune response. These novel findings may be of relevance for other coronaviruses and could serve as the basis for the development of novel antiviral strategies.","overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) named 1a and 1b. Both ORFs are directly translated from the viral genome, resulting in two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), which are autoproteolitically cleaved to release the replication-transcription complex components (8) . The 3= one-third of the genome includes the genes encoding the structural spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as the genusspecific proteins characteristic of each CoV, which are expressed from a nested set of 3=-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) (2, 7, 8) ."
Bornaviruses in naturally infected Psittacus erithacus in Portugal: insights of molecular epidemiology and ecology,"Background: The genus Orthobornavirus comprises non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses able to infect humans, mammals, reptiles and various birds. Parrot bornavirus 1 to 8 (PaBV-1 to 8) causes neurological and/or gastrointestinal syndromes and death on psittacines. We aimed to identify and to produce epidemiologic knowledge about the etiologic agent associated with a death of two female Psittacus erithacus (grey parrot). Methods and Results: Both parrots were submitted for a complete standardised necropsy. Tissue samples were analysed by PCR. The findings in necropsy were compatible with bornavirus infection. Analysis revealed PaBV-4 related with genotypes detected in captive and in wild birds. The N and X proteins of PaBV-4 were more related to avian bornaviruses, while phosphoprotein was more related to variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1). Within the P gene/phosphoprotein a highly conserved region between and within bornavirus species was found. Conclusions: Portugal is on the routes of the intensive world trade of psittacines. Broad screening studies are required to help understanding the role of wild birds in the emergence and spread of pathogenic bornaviruses. PaBV-4 phosphoprotein is closer to VSBV-1 associated with lethal encephalitis in humans than with some of the avian bornaviruses. The highly conserved P gene/ phosphoprotein region is a good target for molecular diagnostics screenings.","Bornaviruses are enveloped, 80 to 100 nm in diameter with a non-segmented genome of single-stranded negative sense RNA of around 8900 nucleotides in length, belonging to the order Mononegavirales [1] . Bornaviruses replicate in the nucleus of the nerve cells of various organs and establish persistent, non-cytolytic infections by exploiting the cellular splicing mechanisms to efficiently use its genome, organized into six open reading frames (ORFs) [1] (Figure 1 ). Alternative transcription start and stop sites and splicing produce mRNAs that are translated to produce the viral-encoded proteins [1] (Figure 1 ). The first transcription unit contains an ORF for the nucleoprotein (N), the second transcription unit contains two overlapping ORFs for the phosphoprotein (P), and the X protein (X) [1] (Figure 1 ). The third transcription unit is spliced differently, and also has different transcription initiation and termination signals, enabling polymerase read-through during transcription, which results in expression of the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G), and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L) [1] ( Figure 1 ). The P and X ORFs overlap; as well as, the M and G ORFs [1] (Figure 1 ). The immunogenicity of phosphoprotein [2] , as well as, the degree of conservation of the phosphoprotein and its gene, within and between bornavirus species, make them good candidates as universal targets in laboratory diagnosis [3] . Once the family Bornaviridae is expanding speedily [4] , producing knowledge about highly conserved regions within phosphoprotein will be useful for the development of sensitive laboratory diagnostic tools. So far, genus Carbovirus, Cultervirus and Orthobornavirus have been identified, which comprise 11 species [4] . From those, 10 species are associated with the development of severe neurological and/or gastrointestinal disease and death of its hosts [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] (Figure 2 ). The disease has been reported in humans, several species of pets, production and wild animals [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Namely, two species infect mammals (Mammalian 1 to 2 orthobornavirus), five infect birds (Passeriform 1 to 2 orthobornavirus, Psittaciform 1 to 2 orthobornavirus and Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus) and three infect reptiles (Queensland carbovirus, Southwest carbovirus and Elapid 1 orthobornavirus) [4] (Figure 2 ). However, some Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus showed the ability to also infect farmed ostriches and wild birds (mallards and jackdaws) [10, 16] . Wild birds are hosts of avian bornaviruses (e.g. strains of Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus and Psittaciform 1 orthobornavirus) [13] [14] [15] 17] and mammalian bornaviruses (e.g. genotypes of Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus) [16] . Therefore, co-infection may play a role in the emergence of new pathogenic and zoonotic bornavirus species; once X and P proteins of PaBV-4 look like to have different ancestors [3] ."
Detection of Bovine Coronavirus in Healthy and Diarrheic Dairy Calves,"Background: BCoV is identified in both healthy and diarrheic calves, complicating its assessment as a primary pathogen. Objectives: To investigate the detection rates of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves and to describe the usefulness of a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (PanCoV-RT-PCR) assay to identify BCoV in samples of diarrheic calves.","N eonatal diarrhea is the most important cause of disease in calves worldwide, 1,2 leading to large economic losses to cattle herds. 3 Common etiologic agents involved in calf diarrhea include Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium spp, bovine rotavirus (BRoV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Most of the studies investigating the etiology of calf diarrhea have focused on sick calves. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, some agents, especially viruses, could be frequently detected in healthy calves. [9] [10] [11] For instance, BCoV has been identified in both healthy and diarrheic calves, 10, 11 complicating assessment of its role as a primary pathogen. BCoV is the causative agent of diarrhea in newborn calves, 12 winter dysentery in adult cows, 13 and respiratory tract illness in calves and adults. 14, 15 However, some studies have identified numerical but not statistical association between BCoV in fecal or nasal samples and clinical signs. [16] [17] [18] Cases of BCoV enteritis occur in both dairy and beef herds, with clinical signs developing between 5 and 30 days of life and a peak of incidence between days 7 and 10. 19 Transmission from calf-to-calf is mainly by the fecal-oral route but respiratory transmission can be possible. 16, 19 Infected calves can excrete high levels of virus within 48 h of experimental infection, and this can continue up to 14 days. 19 The mechanisms of diarrhea due to BCoV infection are still unclear, but malabsorption and hypersecretion appear to play important roles. 20 Clinically recovered calves can continue to shed low levels of virus for weeks. 21, 22 Diagnosis of BCoV enteritis can be achieved by viral culture, antigen-capture ELISA, hemagglutination assay using mouse erythrocytes, and PCR. 19 Recently, a pancoronavirus reverse transcription (RT) PCR assay (PanCoV-RT-PCR) was described to identify human CoV from samples of people with respiratory diseases, 23 with primers that should amplify a 251-bp fragment of the polymerase gene of all known coronaviruses. 24 The utility of PanCoV-RT-PCR to detect BCoV in samples of animals with clinical diseases is yet to be determined."
Unraveling the structural complexity in a single-stranded RNA tail: implications for efficient ligand binding in the prequeuosine riboswitch,"Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) are ubiquitous RNA elements that serve diverse functional roles. Much of our understanding of ssRNA conformational behavior is limited to structures in which ssRNA directly engages in tertiary interactions or is recognized by proteins. Little is known about the structural and dynamic behavior of free ssRNAs at atomic resolution. Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis. Our study unmasks a previously unappreciated level of complexity in ssRNA, which we believe will also serve as an excellent model system for testing and developing computational force fields.","Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), typically located at the ends of RNA hairpins and consisting of more than three unpaired residues, serve diverse structural and functional roles. They can fold onto neighboring RNA hairpins to form pseudoknots, essential architectural RNA elements involved in ribosomal frameshifting (1, 2) , hepatitis C internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) recognition (3, 4) and telomerase activity (5) . Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation is prevented or promoted by 3 0 addition of a polyadenylated tail, which recruits essential protein cofactors (6) . Cleavage of the 5 0 transfer RNA (tRNA) leader by RNase P is a key step in tRNA maturation (7) . In riboswitches, ssRNA links the ligand-binding aptamer domain to the expression platform, providing the basis for communication between the two (8) (9) (10) ."
"Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Assembles in a Post-ER, Pre-Golgi Compartment","AbstracL Expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the major envelope protein of the virus, in the absence of other viral proteins leads to its secretion as oligomers in the form of disk-like or tubular lipoprotein particles. The observation that these lipoprotein particles are heavily disulphide crosslinked is paradoxical since HBsAg assembly is classically believed to occur in the ER, and hence in the presence of high levels of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) which should resolve these higher intermolecular crosslinks. Indeed, incubation of mature, highly disulphide crosslinked HBsAg with recombinant PDI causes the disassembly of HBsAg to dimers. We have used antibodies against resident ER proteins in double immunofluorescence studies to study the stages of the conversion of the HBsAg from individual protein subunits to the secreted, crosslinked, oligomer. We show that HBsAg is rapidly sorted to a post-ER, pre-Golgi compartment which excludes PDI and other major soluble resident ER proteins although it overlaps with the distribution of rab2, an established marker of an intermediate compartment. Kinetic studies showed that disulphide-linked HBsAg dimers began to form during a short (2 rain) pulse, increased in concentration to peak at 60 rain, and then decreased as the dimers were crosslinked to form higher oligomers. These higher oligomers are the latest identifiable intracellular form of HBsAg before its secretion (h/2 = 2 h). Brefeldin A treatment does not alter the localization of HBsAg in this PDI excluding compartment, however, it blocks the formation of new oligomers causing the accumulation of dimeric HBsAg. Hence this oligomerization must occur in a pre-Golgi compartment. These data support a model in which rapid dimer formation, catalyzed by PDI, occurs in the ER, and is followed by transport of dimers to a pre-Golgi compartment where the absence of PDI and a different lumenal environment allow the assembly process to be completed.","AbstracL Expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the major envelope protein of the virus, in the absence of other viral proteins leads to its secretion as oligomers in the form of disk-like or tubular lipoprotein particles.

"Enhanced-Transient Expression of Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein in Nicotiana tabacum, a Protein With Potential Clinical Applications","Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is major cause of liver cirrhosis in humans. HCV capsid (core) protein (HCVcp) is a highly demanded antigen for various diagnostic, immunization and pathogenesis studies. Plants are considered as an expression system for producing safe and inexpensive biopharmaceutical proteins. Although invention of transgenic (stable) tobacco plants expressing HCVcp with proper antigenic properties was recently reported, no data for ""transient-expression"" that is currently the method of choice for rapid, simple and lower-priced protein expression in plants is available for HCVcp. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to design a highly codon-optimized HCVcp gene for construction of an efficient transient-plant expression system for production of HCVcp with proper antigenic properties in a regional tobacco plant (Iranian Jafarabadi-cultivar) by evaluation of different classes of vectors and suppression of gene-silencing in tobacco.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the major cause of blood-borne chronic hepatitis with potential progression to cirrhosis, has infected around 170 million people globally (1) . Due to heterogeneity of HCV proteins, their high mutation rates and complex pathogenesis, no approved vaccine for human application against this viral infection is available to date (2, 3) . Recognition of conserved epitopes in HCV proteins and advancements in the formulation of vaccines in novel modalities, however, have led to the placement of a few HCV vaccines in the pipeline of human clinical trials in recent years (4, 5) . HCV holds a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which encodes for three structural (core protein and envelope proteins E1 and E2) and six nonstructural proteins (4) . Among the HCV proteins, core (HCVcp) is the most conserved HCV antigen, and hence, a good candidate to be considered for HCV vaccine formulations (4) (5) (6) . Accordingly, application of even isolated HCVcp-CTL epitopes (8-10 amino acids) in the context of synthetic multi-epitope HCV vaccines has also been reported (7) (8) (9) . Besides, anticore antibodies are the first to be raised after the onset of infection, a property that has provided an important diagnostic value for this protein and has located it among antibody-capturing antigens in commercially available serological assays for HCV diagnosis (10) . In addition, nucleotide sequence of HCVcp is supposed to encode for other alternated frame-shift proteins (ARFPs) with important pathogenic roles in chronic HCV infection and cirrhosis (4, 11) . Therefore, to fulfill different diagnostic, research and therapeutic demands, production of HCVcp in various expression systems has been addressed (4) (5) . However, since the C-terminal hydrophobic region of HCVcp exerts immune-suppressive effects (4, 12) , its first 120 N-terminal residues, the hydrophilic region (HCVcp N-120), which contains both nuclear localization signals (NLS) (13) and most of the conserved B and T cell epitopes, is usually employed for different diagnostic (10, 14) and vaccine applications (15) (16) (17) ."
OAS1 and OAS3 negatively regulate the expression of chemokines and interferon-responsive genes in human macrophages,"Upon viral infection, the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease L (RNaseL) system works to cleave viral RNA, thereby blocking viral replication. However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1 −/− and OAS3 −/−","During infection with RNA viruses, germline-encoded patternrecognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), recognize viral RNA and trigger various signaling pathways that lead to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines (1) . It is well known that the IFN system plays an important role in the response to viral infection and virus clearance. IFN- and IFN- induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode transcription factors and antiviral effectors, including the 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins (2) ."
Rapid and sensitive insulated isothermal PCR for point-of-need feline leukaemia virus detection,"Objectives Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), a gamma retrovirus, causes diseases of the feline haematopoietic system that are invariably fatal. Rapid and accurate testing at the point-of-need (PON) supports prevention of virus spread and management of clinical disease. This study evaluated the performance of an insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) that detects proviral DNA, and a reverse transcription (RT)-iiPCR that detects both viral RNA and proviral DNA, for FeLV detection at the PON. Methods Mycoplasma haemofelis, feline coronavirus, feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus and feline immunodeficiency virus were used to test analytical specificity. In vitro transcribed RNA, artificial plasmid, FeLV strain American Type Culture Collection VR-719 and a clinical FeLV isolate were used in the analytical sensitivity assays. A retrospective study including 116 clinical plasma and serum samples that had been tested with virus isolation, real-time PCR and ELISA, and a prospective study including 150 clinical plasma and serum samples were implemented to evaluate the clinical performances of the iiPCR-based methods for FeLV detection. Results Ninety-five percent assay limit of detection was calculated to be 16 RNA and five DNA copies for the RT-iiPCR, and six DNA copies for the iiPCR. Both reactions had analytical sensitivity comparable to a reference realtime PCR (qPCR) and did not detect five non-target feline pathogens. The clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR and iiPCR had 98.82% agreement (kappa[κ] = 0.97) and 100% agreement (κ = 1.0), respectively, with the qPCR (n = 85). The agreement between an automatic nucleic extraction/RT-iiPCR system and virus isolation to detect FeLV in plasma or serum was 95.69% (κ = 0.95) and 98.67% (κ = 0.85) in a retrospective (n = 116) and a prospective (n = 150) study, respectively. Conclusions and relevance These results suggested that both RT-iiPCR and iiPCR assays can serve as reliable tools for PON FeLV detection.","Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a gamma retrovirus that causes malignant, proliferative and degenerative disorders of the feline haematopoietic system. 1 The most common outcome of FeLV infection is a regressive infection, whereby cats clear infectious virus from the blood but retain proviral DNA in infected cells and their progeny. [2] [3] [4] Alternatively, in a progressive infection, FeLV replication goes unchecked, and infectious virus or viral RNA can be recovered persistently from the bloodstream. Progressively infected cats provide the major reservoir of infection, and most die within 3 years from a haematopoietic disorder. 5 The prevalence of FeLV is in decline worldwide, [6] [7] [8] owing to the widespread use of effective vaccines, as well as test and removal policies. Accurate and rapid identification of FeLV-infected cats at the point-of-need (PON) can support strategies towards virus eradication. Many diagnostic tests are already available, including immunoassays that detect circulating FeLV p27 antigen, virus isolation (VI) assays that recover circulating infectious virus, and molecular assays that detect either viral RNA (reverse transcription real-time PCR [RT-qPCR]) or integrated proviral DNA (qPCR)."
Identification of a novel coronavirus causing severe pneumonia in human: a descriptive study,"Background: Human infections with zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, have raised great public health concern globally. Here, we report a novel batorigin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans. Methods: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed. Results: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown b-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically 1 closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor. Conclusion: A novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a single positive-stranded RNA genome (∼26-32 kb in length). They belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae, and are classified into four genera: Alphacoronaviruses (a), Betacoronaviruses (b), Gammacoronaviruses (g), and Deltacoronaviruses (d). [1, 2] The viral genome normally encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as several non-structural proteins and multiple unique accessory proteins. [1, 2] CoVs infect humans and a variety of avian and mammalian species worldwide. There are six CoVs known to infect humans, including two a-CoVs (229E and NL63) and four b-CoVs (OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV). [1] [2] [3] [4] All human CoVs are zoonotic as a distinguishing characteristic. [5] In particular, bats are regarded as a key reservoir of CoVs, and many human CoVs are believed to have originated from bats. [5, 6] Since the beginning of this century, two zoonotic CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been identified to cause severe human diseases. [3, 4, 7] The outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003 was responsible for 8096 cases and 794 deaths worldwide. [8] Since its discovery in Middle Eastern countries in 2012, MERS-CoV has infected 2260 people with a current case fatality rate of 35.5%. [9, 10] These outbreaks have raised public health concerns of the potential for the emergence of another novel zoonotic CoV."
"Birth Defects Data from Surveillance Hospitals in Hubei Prov- ince, China, 200l -2008","To determine the prevalence and characteristics of birth defects in perinatal infants in Hubei Province during 200l-2008. Methods: The prevalence of birth defects in perinatal infants delivered after 28 weeks or more was analyzed in Hubei surveillance hospitals during 200l-2008. Results: The incidence of birth defects in perinatal infants from 200l to 2008 was 120.0 per 10,000 births, and was increased by about 41% from 81. 1 in 2001 to 138.5 per 10,000 births in 2008. The incidence in the first 4 years (2005)(2006)(2007)(2008) was much higher than the latter four (2001-2004) (χ 2 =77.64 , P <0.05). The difference in prevalence between urban and rural was of no significance in 2008 (χ 2 =0.03，P >0.05), but that between male and female was significant (χ 2 =5.24 , P <0.05), as the former prevalence was much higher. The prevalence of birth defects was slightly higher among mothers over 35 years old than those under 35 years old, but with no significance (χ 2 =1.98, P >0.05). The two leading birth defects were cleft lip and/or palate and polydactyly, followed by congenital heart disease, hydrocephaly, external ear malformation and neural tube defects. The prevalence of congenital heart disease was rising. Conclusions: Eight years' birth defects data indicate that the birth defect rate was on the rise and the birth defects prevalence in Hubei province should be valued.","Birth defect (BD) is a widely used term for a congenital malformation; it involves the abnormality in morphology, structure, function, metabolism, psychology and behavior. With more epidemics prevented and controlled, it has gradually become the main cause of infant and child mortality. China is one of the countries with high incidence of BD, with 800,000 to 1.2 million infants born with BD and disabilities annually, accounting for four to six percent of the country's total newborn. The Chinese government has established a surveillance system for monitoring BD since 1986. Twenty-three types of BDs were included in the system according to the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification Codes, tenth edition (i.e., . In this research, we analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of BD in perinatal infants in Hubei province (Central China) during 200l-2008, in order to provide a scientific basis for developing control measures over prevention of BD on perinatal infants."
Mechanisms and biomedical implications of -1 programmed ribosome frameshifting on viral and bacterial mRNAs,"Some proteins are expressed as a result of a ribosome frameshifting event that is facilitated by a slippery site and downstream secondary structure elements in the mRNA. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding mechanisms of -1 frameshifting in several viral genes, including IBV 1a/ 1b, HIV-1 gag-pol, and SFV 6K, and in Escherichia coli dnaX. The exact frameshifting route depends on the availability of aminoacyl-tRNAs: the ribosome normally slips into the -1-frame during tRNA translocation, but can also frameshift during decoding at condition when aminoacyl-tRNA is in limited supply. Different frameshifting routes and additional slippery sites allow viruses to maintain a constant production of their key proteins. The emerging idea that tRNA pools are important for frameshifting provides new direction for developing antiviral therapies.","Translation is a tightly regulated step of gene expression which ensures the synthesis of proteins according to the sequence of an mRNA produced during transcription. The ribosome, a macromolecular machine that synthesizes proteins in all cells, controls accurate decoding of mRNA triplets by the respective aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Stringent tRNA selection mechanisms ensure a very low overall error rate of mRNA decoding in the range of 10 À7 to 10 À5 [7] . Each time an amino acid is incorporated into the growing peptide chain, the ribosome moves by one codon along the mRNA to read the next codon. Keeping the codon-wise step of translation is even more essential than preventing missense errors, because slippage by one or two nucleotides results in a completely altered sequence of the synthesized peptide. In fact, spontaneous frameshifting errors are rather infrequent, <10 À5 per codon [8] . However, in some cases, this rigorous reading frame control is abrogated allowing the ribosome to recode genetic information in response to specific stimulatory signals embedded in the mRNA sequence or structure [9, 10] . Programmed ribosome frameshifting (PRF) is a recoding event that allows to produce multiple proteins from the same mRNA by shifting the reading frame in the forward (+PRF) or backward (-PRF) direction [9] [10] [11] [12] . Slippage occurs typically by 1 nucleotide, although 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-nucleotide shifts were also reported [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . -1PRF is found in all kingdoms of life including higher eukaryotes, but is particularly prevalent in viruses and mobile genetic elements [9, 10, 18] . The biological significance of PRF is to increase the genome-coding capacity, to control the stoichiometric ratio between proteins and to regulate gene expression by influencing mRNA stability [9, 10] . Many human pathogenic viruses require frameshifting for their viability, because it ensures production of certain viral enzymes that are not encoded in the 0-frame and modulates the ratio between viral structural proteins necessary for virion assembly [18] [19] [20] [21] . Among the viral proteins produced upon -1PRF, many contribute to viral infectivity either directly by evading the host antiviral response [22] or indirectly by hindering viral particle formation and release, thereby decreasing viral titer [20, 23] ."
,"The activation of somatic mutations conferring sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been widely used in the development of advanced or metastatic primary lung cancer therapy. Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.","Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality of all malignancies in the USA in 2011 and 2013 (1, 2) . Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 70-85% of cases and is primarily treated using systemic chemotherapy (3) . However, NSCLC treatment has evolved due to the development of therapy targeting the activation of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (4) . EGFR activation is caused by genetic mutations, conferring susceptibility to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and was first reported in 2004 (5). EGFR mutations of pulmonary adenocarcinoma are present in 5-15% of the Caucasian population and 40-55% of the East Asian population (6) (7) (8) . Clinical trials have shown that patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation exhibit clinical responses to orally administered EGFR inhibitors (5, 7, 9) . In 2016, Lin et al (4) reported that 20/137 (14.6%) patients with EGFR-mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinoma had a survival time of 5-years (4) . Therefore, detection of EGFR mutations is an important step in the treatment-decision pathway for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma."
Development of rapid immunochromatographic strip test for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) causes acute and severe watery diarrhoea and dehydration, as well as 50-100 per cent mortality in piglets. For the PEDV diagnosis, a rapid test kit that is specific and sensitive to PEDV is critical to monitor this disease at pig farms. The present study aimed to develop an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) strip test for detecting PEDV in faecal swabs. The newly developed diagnostic test showed a detection limit of 10 4.0 TCID 50 /ml of PEDV. Using faecal swab samples, the relative sensitivity and specificity of the ICA kit were 95.0 per cent and 98.6 per cent, respectively, compared with those of real-time RT-PCR. In samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV, the results showed 100 per cent agreement with those found by real-time RT-PCR. Our developed test strip will be useful for rapid diagnosis and can be used for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection.","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes acute and severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration, and shows 50-100 per cent mortality in up to one-week-old piglets and less severe disease in older pigs. 1 PEDV belongs to genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and is an enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. 2 3 Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) have been reported in several countries in Europe, as well as in Asian countries including China, Thailand and South Korea, since the disease was first identified in England in the early 1970s. 1 3 Recently, PEDV was diagnosed in the midwestern region of the USA in 2013. 4 5 Since then, the virus has spread rapidly and was confirmed throughout 30 states in the USA. PEDV has significant economic impacts on the pig industry, causing the loss of approximately seven million piglets within the one-year epidemic period in the USA. 3 Moreover, the emergence of PEDV has been reported in western, central and eastern Europe, and the genome sequences were found to be closely related to PEDV strains from the USA, showing a sequence identity of more than 99 per cent. [6] [7] [8] The genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb in size and encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), and four non-structural proteins, including 1a, 1b, 3a and 3b. 2 The S protein is critical to regulating interactions between receptor glycoproteins and virus ligands and for mediating viral entry into host cells, while the N protein is a basic phosphor-protein important for maintaining the nucleocapsid structure. Epitopes of the N protein may play a role in inducing cell-mediated immunity. 2 Additionally, the N protein may be an appropriate target because it is the predominant antigen expressed in coronavirus-infected cells. 9 To diagnose PEDV, laboratory-based techniques are necessary, because PED is clinically indistinguishable from other diarrhoea diseases such as transmissible gastritis-enteritis virus infection. 10 To detect the PEDV antigen, virus isolation, immunofluorescence testing, immunohistochemical techniques, ELISA, and molecular techniques including RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR are currently used in most laboratories. 1 However, to obtain accurate results, these methods require welltrained technicians and specific equipment, and are time-consuming. Moreover, issues such as transportation delays or temperature changes during shipping from outbreak locations to diagnostic laboratories may affect the diagnosis results. 1 10 Therefore, a rapid test kit that is specific and sensitive to PEDV is critical to monitoring this disease on pig farms. Here, we aimed to develop and validate an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for the rapid and qualitative detection of PEDV antigen from diseased animals. The assay detects N protein of PEDV using highly selective monoclonal antibodies."

"Nucleolar Localization of HIV-1 Rev Is Required, Yet Insufficient for Production of Infectious Viral Particles","Combination antiretroviral therapy fails in complete suppression of HIV-1 due to drug resistance and persistent latency. Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets-the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli-speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1 HXB2 replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1 NL4-3 containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1 NL4-3 Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1 NL4-3 . HIV-1 NL4-3 variants were capable of CD4 + host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle. We currently reveal that viral integration is deregulated in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations.","A n underexplored area in HIV-1 research is the nucleolar pathway viral proteins Tat and Rev participate in during viral proliferation. Unlike Tat, which accumulates in the nucleus and nucleolus, Rev has mainly nucleolar subcellular localization. Upon viral infection, HIV genomic reverse transcription and proviral integration into host chromosome leads to cellular Pol II-dependent early expression of env-derived proteins Tat, Rev, and Nef. Tat facilitates transcription and expression of viral genes after association with a transactivation response element (TAR) found within 5¢ LTR of HIV transcripts.

"Etiology, Seasonality, and Clinical Features of Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Hospitalized With Acute Bronchiolitis: A Single-Center Study","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viral frequency, seasonality, and clinical and demographic features of patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed in 316 infants younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory tract infection agents were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 316 infants were included in this study. Of the 316 infants, at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected in 75% (237/316). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) followed by rhinovirus (n = 78, 24.6%). In this study, where viral agents were determined via PCR in patients who were followed-up due to the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, RSV was detected as the most common agent, as in other studies. In almost half of the RSV-positive patients, RSV was accompanied by a second or third agent.","Acute bronchiolitis (AB), which is the most common acute lower respiratory system disease in infants, is often caused by a viral infection. It is especially the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 6 months of age. 1, 2 Epidemic peaks of AB are frequently seen during the winter season. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is usually the cause of 50% to 80% of the cases, but other viruses including adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus have also been reported to cause AB as the sole pathogen or as coinfection with or without RSV. 3, 4 With various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, possible new agents like rhinovirus, human metapnomovirus, human bocavirus, Bordatella pertussis, and atypical pathogens were also described as the leading causes of AB. [5] [6] [7] Having a cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, and premature birth increase the risk of AB-associated respiratory failure, or even death. 8 The World Health Organization has reported that RSV is the causative pathogen for over 30 million new acute lower respiratory infection episodes in children under 5 years of age and it gives rise to more than 3.4 million hospital admissions and 160 000 deaths every year. 9, 10 The diagnosis of AB is made based on typical history with wheezing and characteristic clinical features such as tachypnea, nasal flaring, chest retractions, and wheezing and/or rales followed by a viral upper respiratory infection in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 11 Chest radiographs and laboratory studies may be thought of on clinical suspicion after evaluating the differential diagnosis for secondary or comorbid bacterial infection, complications, or other conditions. Viral diagnosis methods including antigen detection or immunofluorescence of nasal secretion wash or nasal aspiration, rapid antigen tests, and PCR are only suggested for identifying specific viral agents in children with bronchiolitis if the results will determine discontinuation of palivizumab prophylaxis, initiation or continuation/discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. [12] [13] [14] [15] Majority of studies have recently researched the burden of respiratory viral tract infection agents in AB with larger groups. In these studies, epidemiological, clinical, and risk factors of AB have also been defined. So, it can be said that AB is frequent in infancy and that there is an increase in the number of admissions to hospitals and bronchiolitis-related morbidity."
The battle against SARS and MERS coronaviruses: Reservoirs and Animal Models,"In humans, infection with the coronavirus, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), induces acute respiratory failure, resulting in high mortality. Irregular coronavirus related epidemics indicate that the evolutionary origins of these two pathogens need to be identified urgently and there are still questions related to suitable laboratory animal models. Thus, in this review we aim to highlight key discoveries concerning the animal origin of the virus and summarize and compare current animal models.","In the aftermath of the SARS outbreak, its high morbidity and mortality made the identification of natural reservoirs and an appropriate animal model necessary in order to ascertain the interspecies transmission chain, to develop procedures for protecting public health, to promote research on the SARS-CoV mechanism, and to establish animal models for use in developing antivirals and vaccines."
Respiratory viral infections in children and adolescents with hematological malignancies,"Background: Despite the introduction of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection (RVI), guidance on the application of this test and the management of RVI in immunocompromised children is lacking. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of RVI and established strategies for the PCR test in children and adolescents with hematological malignancies.","Introduction. Infection is the main cause of treatmentrelated mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. 1 Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of infection, as well as infection prevention, are essential to improve the prognosis of immune compromised patients. In these patients, neutropenic fever (NF) has been the focus, and bacterial and fungal infection is emphasized. 2 Among viruses, Herpesviridae, which maintains latency and reactivates during immune suppression caused by anti-cancer chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), is considered a major pathogen. However, the causative pathogens are not identified in 53-79% of patients with NF, 3, 4 and some of which may be respiratory viruses (RVs)."

"Molecular detection and phylogenetic properties of isolated infectious bronchitis viruses from broilers in Ahvaz, southwest Iran, based on partial sequences of spike gene","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease involving mostly upper respiratory tract in chickens, leading to significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%. This study indicates the role of IBVs in the respiratory disorders of broiler flocks located in southwest Iran, and also the existence of a variant of IBV, which is distinguishable from the other Iranian variants.","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute contagious viral infection with low mortality and a significant reduction in performance in chicken. The causative agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense and RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, the genus gamma Coronavirus. The virus consists of three important structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), the membrane (M), and the spike (S1 and S2) glycoproteins. The nucleotide sequence of the S1 gene is highly variable, which makes it prone to mutation and emergence of new variants of the virus. For this reason, the molecular classification of IBVs is based on the investigation of the S1 gene. 1 Vaccination is one of the best ways of immunization of susceptible birds. However, vaccinated flocks may experience disease involvement because there is almost no cross-protection among serotypes. 2 Consequently, the viral strains that exist in a different geographical area must first be identified and their pathogenicity should be determined in order to select an appropriate virus strain for vaccination."
ARTICLE Reconstructing propagation networks with natural diversity and identifying hidden sources,"Our ability to uncover complex network structure and dynamics from data is fundamental to understanding and controlling collective dynamics in complex systems. Despite recent progress in this area, reconstructing networks with stochastic dynamical processes from limited time series remains to be an outstanding problem. Here we develop a framework based on compressed sensing to reconstruct complex networks on which stochastic spreading dynamics take place. We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing. Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it. Our approach thus establishes a paradigm for tracing and controlling epidemic invasion and information diffusion in complex networked systems. ½S i ðt 2 Þ þ S i ðt 6 Þ=2 and hS i ðt 2 þ 1Þi ¼ ½S i ðt 12 Þ þ S i ðt 14 Þ=2 based on the remaining strings marked in different colours (see Methods for more details).

A great challenge is that the network structure and the nodal dynamics are often unknown but only limited measured time series are available. To control the system dynamics, it is imperative to be able to map out the system details from data. Reconstructing complex network structure and dynamics from data, the inverse problem, has thus become a central issue in contemporary network science and engineering 1-8 .

Trends in Incident and Recurrent Rates of First-Ever Ischemic Stroke in Taiwan between 2000 and 2011,"The burden of stroke is comparatively greater in Asian countries than in the Western world. While there has been a documented recent decline in the incidence of stroke in several Western nations due to better risk factor management, much less is known about the nature and trajectory of stroke in Asia over the last decade. The objective of this study was to explore risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke in Taiwan. Methods We conducted a nationwide cohort study by reviewing all hospitalized patients ( ≥ 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke between 2001 and 2011 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Results A total of 291,381 first-ever ischemic stroke patients were enrolled between 2000 and 2011. The average age was about 70 years and approximately 58.6% of them were men. While prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, as well as use of statins, antiplatelet agents, and oral anticoagulant agents for atrial fibrillation significantly increased; incidence (142.3 vs. 129.5 per 100,000 in 2000 and 2011, respectively) and one-year recurrence (9.6% vs. 7.8% in 2000 and 2011, respectively) of stroke declined during this period of time.","Compared with a nonfatal myocardial infarction, a nonfatal stroke causes a 1.5-fold greater loss of disability-adjusted lifeyear. 1 Nonetheless, over the past decade there has been a clear and impressive decline in the incidence of stroke in several Western nations. [2] [3] [4] [5] The positive change in the occurrence of stroke in these countries has been attributed primarily to better screening and treatment of established risk factors for stroke, particularly hypertension. 6 The burden of stroke is greater in Asian countries than in the Western world, including a substantially higher incidence of stroke than myocardial infarc-tion. [7] [8] [9] However, data on the extent to which several Asia countries have recently fared with regard to improvement in stroke outcomes are relatively sparse. One study suggested the incidence of stroke decreased from 1961 to 2000 in Japan 7 and an overview study revealed that recurrent stroke decreased in each decade from 1960 to 2010. 10 Certainly more nationwide data on the evolving nature and trajectory of stroke in Asia are needed for research and planning purposes. The objective of this study was to explore risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke using the entire population in Taiwan by National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD)."

Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","While the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) spread rapidly throughout China for several weeks since December 2019, the virus had not taken off outside China in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the Chinese government put in place. One exception is the outbreak of COVID-19 that developed aboard the Diamond Princess Ship which was detected in early February when one of its passengers, a traveler from Hong Kong, tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The number of cases in the Diamond Princess Ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by February 18, 2020. In contrast, the total number of cases in Singapore, one of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases after China, was only 77 at the time (WHO, 2019) ."
"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3=-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells","Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21-to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3=-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.","continuous arms race with their hosts, the outcome of which might ultimately result in either viral persistence, clearance of the viral infection, or death of the infected cells. The arsenal of antiviral defenses and viral counter defense mechanisms is vast and very diverse among the different phyla of life. Plants, insects, nematodes, and fungi mostly (if not exclusively) rely upon an innate immune response, whereas mammals have evolved an adaptive response in addition to this first line of defense. In the former organisms, the antiviral component of the innate immune response is mainly based on a highly conserved process commonly referred to as RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi). In this phenomenon, long double-stranded RNAs of viral origin are cleaved by the RNase Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then assembled into effector complexes that contain a member of the Argonaute (Ago) family; this results in targeted degradation of viral messenger or genomic RNAs (1) ."
Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast,"Organisms exposed to reactive oxygen species, generated endogenously during respiration or by environmental conditions, undergo oxidative stress. Stress response can either repair the damage or activate one of the programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, for example apoptosis, and finally end in cell death. One striking characteristic, which accompanies apoptosis in both vertebrates and yeast, is a fragmentation of cellular DNA and mammalian apoptosis is often associated with degradation of different RNAs. We show that in yeast exposed to stimuli known to induce apoptosis, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and ageing, two large subunit ribosomal RNAs, 25S and 5.8S, became extensively degraded with accumulation of specific intermediates that differ slightly depending on cell death conditions. This process is most likely endonucleolytic, is correlated with stress response, and depends on the mitochondrial respiratory status: rRNA is less susceptible to degradation in respiring cells with functional defence against oxidative stress. In addition, RNA fragmentation is independent of two yeast apoptotic factors, metacaspase Yca1 and apoptosis-inducing factor Aif1, but it relies on the apoptotic chromatin condensation induced by histone H2B modifications. These data describe a novel phenotype for certain stress-and ageingrelated PCD pathways in yeast.","Gene expression in all organisms is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription initiation, mRNA stability and turnover, translation and protein degradation. Not surprisingly, rapid changes in cell metabolism and most responses to environmental stimuli involve significant flux of many cellular RNAs, of which mRNA transcriptome profiles have been most extensively studied to date (1, 2) . However, also stable RNAs, such as ribosomal, transfer, nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs), are likely to undergo specific transformations in altered conditions. It has been demonstrated that certain pathways of cell death are accompanied by the destruction of nucleic acids. For example, in metazoans the programmed cell death (PCD) called apoptosis, in addition to irreversible DNA damage, which is considered an apoptotic hallmark (3) , also involves specific cleavage of several RNA species, including 28S rRNA, U1 snRNA or Ro RNP-associated Y RNAs (4) . It was proposed that rRNA degradation could contribute to cell autodestruction, whereas degradation of anti-apoptotic factors mRNAs would accelerate apoptosis. In higher eukaryotes, RNA cleavage is probably carried out by RNase L, a 2 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate-dependent endoribonuclease, which functions in RNA decay during the interferon-induced response to viral infection, and whose activation in animal cells causes apoptosis (5) (6) (7) . However, RNase L-independent cleavage of 28S rRNA in virus infected cells has also been reported (8) ."
NOTE Sterile nodular panniculitis with lung and lymph node involvement in a Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altica),"A 2-to 4-year-old uncastrated male Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altica) bred in a local wild animal park presented with generalized clinical signs including abdominal pain, fever, lethargy, and anorexia, along with subcutaneous nodules along the trunk. The patient subsequently died of chronic, progressive dyspnea despite 45 days of antibiotic treatment. At necropsy, mesenteric fat inflammation and multiple subcutaneous, peritoneal, and intraabdominal nodules were observed. The lungs demonstrated congestion and heavy coagulation, and necrotic foci were observed on the cut surface. Histopathologically, the nodules were identified as granulomatous fatty tissue with numerous lymphocytes, infiltration with lipid-laden macrophages, and fibrosis. These changes were also noted in the lung. The etiology of this condition remains undetermined.","Panniculitides are a group of heterogeneous inflammatory diseases involving the subcutaneous fat that are characterized by the development of inflammatory nodules or swelling within subcutaneous tissues. The lower extremities are most frequently affected, and lesions are typically accompanied by systemic symptoms. Despite a wide range of causes, most forms of panniculitis involve the same clinical features."
Herbal drug BNO 1016 is safe and effective in the treatment of acute viral rhinosinusitis,"Conclusion: Daily intake of 480 mg of BNO 1016 for 15 days is an effective treatment in acute viral rhinosinusitis. Objectives: The pooled efficacy data of two similar randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials were analyzed. Safety was evaluated on the basis of the individual trials. Methods: The efficacy analysis was based on 589 patients. Treatment was performed orally with either 3 Â 160 mg BNO 1016 (n = 294) or 3 Â placebo (n = 295) for 15 days. In both trials patients underwent five visits to the investigational sites. Symptoms were evaluated according to the EPOS 2012 guideline. Ultrasonography was used to confirm the diagnosis at onset of treatment and the remission of symptoms at the last visit. Efficacy was evaluated by the investigator as the mean major symptom score (MSS) at the end of treatment (visit 5, day 14). Patients reported symptoms and social/ emotional consequences of rhinosinusitis using a quality of life questionnaire (SNOT-20 GAV). Results: MSS improved during the treatment period by a mean of 10.02 ± 1.61 score points to 2.47 ± 2.55 for BNO 1016 and of 9.87 ± 1.52 to 3.63 ± 3.63 for placebo. Differences between treatment groups at end of therapy (1.16 ± 3.14 score points; p < 0.0001) and patient-assessed quality of life (p = 0.0015) were statistically significant in favor of BNO 1016.",During recent years the concept rhinosinusitis has been introduced to elucidate that an inflammation occurs simultaneously in the nose and the paranasal sinuses. A rhinosinusitis usually involves one or several paranasal sinuses. It might be confirmed by ultrasonography or as an opacification in X-ray investigation. According to the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS 2012) acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is definedbesides as an inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinusesby two or more of the following characteristic symptoms: nasal congestion or secretion combined with facial pain or pressure or loss/reduction of smell [1] .
The role of C5a in acute lung injury induced by highly pathogenic viral infections,"The complement system, an important part of innate immunity, plays a critical role in pathogen clearance. Unregulated complement activation is likely to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by highly pathogenic virus including influenza A viruses H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. In highly pathogenic virus-induced acute lung diseases, high levels of chemotactic and anaphylatoxic C5a were produced as a result of excessive complement activaiton. Overproduced C5a displays powerful biological activities in activation of phagocytic cells, generation of oxidants, and inflammatory sequelae named ''cytokine storm'', and so on. Blockade of C5a signaling have been implicated in the treatment of ALI induced by highly pathogenic virus. Herein, we review the literature that links C5a and ALI, and review our understanding of the mechanisms by which C5a affects ALI during highly pathogenic viral infection. In particular, we discuss the potential of the blockade of C5a signaling to treat ALI induced by highly pathogenic viruses.","The epithelium of the lung is vulnerable to damage caused by inhaled microorganisms and other noxious particles. Many studies suggested the presence of complement components at the alveolar epithelium, where inhaled airborne particles and microorganisms are deposited. [1] [2] [3] In addition, the complement system has been implicated in the development of acute lung diseases induced by highly pathogenic viruses including influenza A virus H1N1, 4 H5N1, 5 H7N9, 6 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), 7 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov). 8 However, the specific contributions of complement to lung diseases based on innate and adaptive immunity are just beginning to emerge. Elucidating the role of complement-mediated immune regulation in these diseases will help identify new targets for therapeutic interventions. 9 Complement activation leads to the formation of bioactive molecules, including the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, and the lytic membrane attack complex (C5b-9). 10 The complement-activated product C5a is a strong chemoattractant and is involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes, in activation of phagocytic cells and release of granulebased enzymes and generation of oxidants. 10 C5a also displays other powerful biological activities including inducing ''cytokine storm.'' On the other hand, blockade of C5a signaling has demonstrated potential benefits in the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by highly pathogenic viruses. In this article, we summarize recent developments in our understanding of the role of C5a in mediating aute lung injury induced by highly pathogenic viruses."
"High proportion of MERS-CoV shedding dromedaries at slaughterhouse with a potential epidemiological link to human cases, Qatar 2014","Two of the earliest Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases were men who had visited the Doha central animal market and adjoining slaughterhouse in Qatar. We show that a high proportion of camels presenting for slaughter in Qatar show evidence for nasal MERS-CoV shedding (62/105). Sequence analysis showed the circulation of at least five different virus strains at these premises, suggesting that this location is a driver of MERS-CoV circulation and a high-risk area for human exposure. No correlation between RNA loads and levels of neutralizing antibodies was observed, suggesting limited immune protection and potential for reinfection despite previous exposure.","D romedary camels are likely the primary source of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans, but further evidence is needed to support their role in zoonotic transmission. Two of the earliest diagnosed cases in Qatar were men who had visited the Doha central animal market and the adjoining central slaughterhouse (Farag, pers. comm.). Therefore, pre-and postmortem sampling was conducted on dromedary camels (n0105) at the central slaughterhouse in Doha, Qatar. Nasal, oral, and rectal swabs collected prior to slaughter were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA. Most of the camels that were sampled showed evidence for MERS-CoV shedding at the time of slaughter (59%). Sequence analysis showed the circulation of at least five different virus strains at the slaughterhouse premises. An understanding of the extent and pattern of MERS-CoV shedding by dromedaries presenting for slaughter provides insight into the risks for MERS-CoV exposure of persons with occupational contact with live camels and their carcasses."
Bacterial and Viral Identification Rate in Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Korea,The most common cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is respiratory infection. Most studies of bacterial or viral cause in AECOPD have been conducted in Western countries. We investigated bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD in Korea.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an obstructive lung disease caused by smoking and air pollution. 1,2 COPD patients often experience sudden aggravation of respiratory symptoms called acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), and require additional treatment. AECOPD leads to deterioration in quality of life and substantial morbidity and mortality. [3] [4] [5] A major cause of AECOPD is bacterial or viral infection. [6] [7] [8] Bacterial and viral infections have regional variability, and epidemiological characteristics should be considered during treatment. However, most previous analyses of bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD have been conducted in Western countries; [9] [10] [11] [12] studies in Asia are scarce and unclear. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD in Korea based on epidemiological factors."
Characterization of a Novel Influenza Virus in Cattle and Swine: Proposal for a New Genus in the Orthomyxoviridae Family,"We have recently reported the isolation of a novel virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/ OK), with 50% overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICV), from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that","but distant subtype of ICV. Previously, only influenza A viruses were thought to possess multiple subtypes (10) . Cocirculation of multiple influenza virus subtypes allows for antigenic shift, the process of rapid evolution mediated by reassortment of the genomic RNA segments of two parent viruses."
E-Mail Synthetic Biology and Personalized Medicine,"Synthetic biology, application of synthetic chemistry to biology, is a broad term that covers the engineering of biological systems with structures and functions not found in nature to process information, manipulate chemicals, produce energy, maintain cell environment and enhance human health.

Methods based on synthetic biology enable the design of novel strategies for the treatment of cancer, immune diseases metabolic disorders and infectious diseases as well as the production of cheap drugs. The potential of synthetic genome, using an expanded genetic code that is designed for specific drug synthesis as well as delivery and activation of the drug in vivo by a pathological signal, was already pointed out during a lecture delivered at Kuwait University in 2005. Of two approaches to synthetic biology, top-down and bottom-up, the latter is more relevant to the development of personalized medicines as it provides more flexibility in constructing a partially synthetic cell from basic building blocks for a desired task.","Synthetic biology, application of synthetic chemistry to biology, is a broad term that covers the engineering of biological systems with structures and functions not found in nature to process information, manipulate chemicals, produce energy, maintain cell environment and enhance human health [1] . Synthetic biology includes technologies for DNA synthesis and assembly of fragments of DNA for gene synthesis, sometimes referred to as synthetic genomics.

Human intestinal tract serves as an alternative infection route for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused human respiratory infections with a high case fatality rate since 2012. However, the mode of virus transmission is not well understood. The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection. We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication. We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified as a novel zoonotic virus causing human respiratory infection in 2012 (1) . As of July 2017, MERS-CoV has caused 2037 laboratoryconfirmed infection cases, including 710 deaths, with a crude case fatality rate of about 35% (2) . The clinical spectrum of MERS ranged from asymptomatic or mild respiratory disease to acute fulminant pneumonia with respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure resulting in a fatal outcome. Common symptoms were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal symptoms were among the most commonly reported extrapulmonary clinical features of MERS; about one-third of MERS patients had gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (3, 4) ."
Origin and Evolution of the Kiwifruit Canker Pandemic,"Recurring epidemics of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) bleeding canker disease are caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa). In order to strengthen understanding of population structure, phylogeography, and evolutionary dynamics, we isolated Pseudomonas from cultivated and wild kiwifruit across six provinces in China. Based on the analysis of 80 sequenced Psa genomes, we show that China is the origin of the pandemic lineage but that strain diversity in China is confined to just a single clade. In contrast, Korea and Japan harbor strains from multiple clades. Distinct independent transmission events marked introduction of the pandemic lineage into New Zealand, Chile, Europe, Korea, and Japan. Despite high similarity within the core genome and minimal impact of within-clade recombination, we observed extensive variation even within the single clade from which the global pandemic arose.","A pandemic of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) bleeding canker disease caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) emerged in 2008 with severe consequences for production in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and Chile (Balestra et al. 2010; Abelleira et al. 2011; Everett et al. 2011; Vanneste et al. 2011; Koh et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2013; Sawada et al. 2015) . Earlier disease epidemics in China, South Korea, and Japan had regional impacts, however as infections were often lethal and the pathogen rapidly disseminated, Psa was predicted to pose a major threat to global kiwifruit production Koh et al. 2002) . Despite recognition of this threat-one subsequently realized in 2008-little was done to advance understanding of population structure, particularly across regions of eastern Asia that mark the native home of the genus Actinidia."
Social Media and the Dissemination of Prepublication Data in Surgical Fields Special Topic,"1 the advent of the internet and the spread of social media and smartphones, a poster presented in the morning at a regional conference may be disseminated globally within 48 hours. 2 Background: This review investigates the use of social media at surgical conferences and possible effects of prepublication data release in surgical fields. Potential risks include patient harm by the preliminary application of research that lacks sufficient peer review, infringements on intellectual property, and loss of ""research novelty."" Methods: A literature review of the current use of social media in dispersion of prepublication data was performed. Current submission guidelines for surgical conferences and journals were analyzed for data release embargos and social media use policies. Results: Conference abstract guidelines mentioned data embargos half of the time and the use of social media less than one third of the time. Eighty percentage of journal instructions to authors contained guidelines on both. Conclusions: In nonsurgical fields, the appropriateness of the use of social media to release prepublication data is increasingly being discussed. Little guidance exists on how surgical conference attendees should use social media while at conferences. Given the potential for patient harm and negative impact on intellectual property and attribution, further discussion is warranted. Introducción: Esta crítica investiga el uso de las redes sociales en las conferencias quirúrgicas y los efectos posibles de los datos pre-publicados en cirugía. Los riesgos probables incluyen: daño al paciente causado por la aplicación prematura de las investigaciones sin bastante análisis, violación de la propiedad intelectual, y perdido de ""novedad de investigación."" Metodología: Un repaso fue hecho sobre el rol de las redes sociales en la propagación de los datos pre-publicados. Las normas actuales para la entrega de las conferencias y los periódicos quirúrgicos claves fueron analizadas por las reglas gobernando el uso de las redes sociales y los embargos del lanzamiento de datos. Resultados: Las reglas generales sobre la entrega de abstractos para las conferencias mencionaron los embargos de datos la mitad del tiempo mientras que estas mismas reglas mencionaron el uso de las redes sociales menos que un tercio el tiempo. 80% de las instrucciones de los periódicos dirigidas a los autores tuvieron las reglas generales sobre los dos: los embargos de datas y las redes sociales. Conclusiones: En las especialidades non-quirúrgicas, la pertinencia del uso de las redes sociales para lanzar el dato pre-publicado es discutida con más frecuencia. No existen normas sobre cómo se usan las redes sociales durante las conferencias. Dado el daño potencial al paciente y el impacto negativo en la propiedad y la atribución intelectuales, más discusión está obligatoria.","Historically, research articles were placed under dissemination embargo until final publication. 1 This served to protect copyright and preserve the novelty of data. It also ensured that the public and the media were not privy to datasets and analyses that had the potential to change significantly between prepublication status and final article publication."
Microarrays for Pathogen Detection and Analysis,"DNA microarrays have emerged as a viable platform for detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical and environmental samples. These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","Infectious diseases pose a growing threat to public health, due to increased rates of population growth, international trade and air travel, climate change, bacterial antibiotic resistance and a wide range of other factors. In addition, global conflicts over the past decade have raised concerns that pathogenic agents might be released deliberately by terrorist organizations or other entities. Public and private funding agencies have responded to these concerns by investing heavily in the development of new assays for microbial surveillance and discovery. The majority of these new methods involve direct detection of microbial nucleic acids. Ideally, these methods should be effective both as detection assays (for identification of known pathogens) and as discovery techniques (for revealing the presence of novel, previously uncharacterized organisms)."
BAG3: a multifaceted protein that regulates major cell pathways,"Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) protein is a member of BAG family of co-chaperones that interacts with the ATPase domain of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 through BAG domain (110-124 amino acids). BAG3 is the only member of the family to be induced by stressful stimuli, mainly through the activity of heat shock factor 1 on bag3 gene promoter. In addition to the BAG domain, BAG3 contains also a WW domain and a proline-rich (PXXP) repeat, that mediate binding to partners different from Hsp70. These multifaceted interactions underlie BAG3 ability to modulate major biological processes, that is, apoptosis, development, cytoskeleton organization and autophagy, thereby mediating cell adaptive responses to stressful stimuli. In normal cells, BAG3 is constitutively present in a very few cell types, including cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells, in which the protein appears to contribute to cell resistance to mechanical stress. A growing body of evidence indicate that BAG3 is instead expressed in several tumor types. In different tumor contexts, BAG3 protein was reported to sustain cell survival, resistance to therapy, and/or motility and metastatization. In some tumor types, down-modulation of BAG3 levels was shown, as a proof-of-principle, to inhibit neoplastic cell growth in animal models. This review attempts to outline the emerging mechanisms that can underlie some of the biological activities of the protein, focusing on implications in tumor progression.","Bcl2-associated athanogene (BAG) proteins are a family of co-chaperones that interact with the ATPase domain of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 through a specific structural domain known as BAG domain (110-124 amino acids). 1, 2 Members of the family are found throughout the evolution in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe), invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila), amphibians (Xenopus laevis), mammals (humans, mice) and plants (Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana), 1,3-6 suggesting a fundamental biological role. BAG3 was originally identified by yeast two-hybrid screening using the ATPase domain of the Hsp (heat shock cognate (Hsc)/Hsp) 70 as a bait. 1 In addition to the BAG domain, BAG3 contains a WW domain and a proline-rich repeat (PXXP; Figure 1a ) that mediate binding to other partners. 1, 7, 8 Here we will outline the roles so far identified of BAG3 in the regulation of major biological processes, that is, apoptosis, development, cytoskeleton organization and autophagy. By modulating these pathways, BAG3 appears to mediate cell adaptive responses to stressful stimuli, and its alterations result in altered homeostasis and reduced cytoprotection, explaining why its expression is often found deregulated in a vast series of tumors."
Nivolumab-induced Myocarditis Successfully Treated with Corticosteroid Therapy: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,"A 62-year-old man presented to our hospital for the further evaluation and treatment of his back pain, general fatigue, and dyspnea, which had developed 4 days after the 29th administration of nivolumab to treat his lung cancer. Based on his clinical history, elevated serum cardiac enzyme values, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and myocardial biopsy findings, he was diagnosed with myocarditis induced by nivolumab. Corticosteroid therapy improved his condition, and CMR performed on hospital day 11 also showed remarkable improvement. Although nivolumab-induced myocarditis is rare, cardiologists should consider it when encountering patients treated with such a drug for malignant disease.","Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that has become a new treatment option for malignant tumors. While initially proven effective for melanoma, the diseases for which this agent is administered have been expanding. However, a number of immune-related adverse events (ir-AEs), which are rarely seen in conventional chemotherapy, have been reported with this drug, and as the frequency of its use increases, there are concerns that the number of side effects will also increase."
Effects of Timely Control Intervention on the Spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection,"The 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea caused major economic and social problems. The control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. This study investigates whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective preventive strategy. Methods: The SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model with estimated parameters for the time series data of the daily MERS-CoV incidence in Korea was considered from May to December 2015. For 10,000 stochastic simulations, the SEIR model was computed using the Gillespie algorithm. Depending on the time of control intervention on the 20th, 40th, and 60th days after the identification of the index case, the box plots of MERS-CoV incidences in Korea were computed, and the results were analyzed via ANOVA.","The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea in 2015 exerted huge social and economic tolls. Mathematical models are effective for understanding and controlling the spread of MERS-CoV, and so far, many attempts at applying mathematical models have been made to understand the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. Using a mathematical model, we investigated whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective preventive strategy."
Rapid Response Systems Reduce In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Arrest: A Pilot Study and Motivation for a Nationwide Survey,"Background: Early recognition of the signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration could diminish the incidence of cardiopulmonary arrest. The present study investigates outcomes with respect to cardiopulmonary arrest rates in institutions with and without rapid response systems (RRSs) and the current level of cardiopulmonary arrest rate in tertiary hospitals. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on data from 14 tertiary hospitals. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate reports were obtained from each hospital to include the number of cardiopulmonary arrest events in adult patients in the general ward, the annual adult admission statistics, and the structure of the RRS if present. Results: Hospitals with RRSs showed a statistically significant reduction of the CPR rate between 2013 and 2015 (odds ratio [OR], 0.731; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.577 to 0.927; P = 0.009). Nevertheless, CPR rates of 2013 and 2015 did not change in hospitals without RRS (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.868 to 1.124; P = 0.854). National university-affiliated hospitals showed less cardiopulmonary arrest rate than private university-affiliated in 2015 (1.92 vs. 2.40; OR, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.702 to 0.912; P = 0.001). High-volume hospitals showed lower cardiopulmonary arrest rates compared with medium-volume hospitals in 2013 (1.76 vs. 2.63; OR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.577 to 0.772; P < 0.001) and in 2015 (1.55 vs. 3.20; OR, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.428 to 0.550; P < 0.001). Conclusions: RRSs may be a feasible option to reduce the CPR rate.

CLINICAL EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE RESEARCH K O R E A N V A C C I N E S O C I E T Y K O R E A N A C C I N E O C I E T Y V S Animal models for dengue vaccine development and testing,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. There are four different serotypes of DENV [1] [2] [3] [4] . DENV is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and DENV infection causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DSS is fatal in 1%-2.5% of cases with intensive treatment, and the mortality rate increases to >20% in the absence of proper treatment [1]. Thus far, DENV infection has not been reported in South Korea, except in patients who have traveled to endemic areas, such as Asia-Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa, which are the major sited of dengue fever outbreaks. According to the World Health Organization, 40% of the world population lives in high-DENV areas. An estimated 390 million people are infected with DENV, and about 20,000 of them die each year [2]. In 2014, 113 cases of dengue fever were reported in Yoyogi park in central Tokyo [3] . Similarly, in Europe, from 2012 to 2013, more than 3,000 people were infected with DENV in Portuguese Madeira on the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, 2 and 17 cases of dengue fever in persons who had no previous travel abroad were reported in France and Croatia, respectively, which were the first known cases of self-occurrence in Europe since 1928 and suggest the possibility of a future DENV epidemic [4] . A. aegypti and A. albopictus, which spread DENV, mostly inhabit the tropics and subtropics. These mosquitoes also carry several other infectious viruses, such as Chikungunya, West Nile fever, and yellow fever viruses, which have already been imported into Europe and the Americas by cargo ships and airlines. In 2013, subtropical Dengue fever is a tropical endemic disease; however, because of climate change, it may become a problem in South Korea in the near future. Research on vaccines for dengue fever and outbreak preparedness are currently insufficient. In addition, because there are no appropriate animal models, controversial results from vaccine efficacy assessments and clinical trials have been reported. Therefore, to study the mechanism of dengue fever and test the immunogenicity of vaccines, an appropriate animal model is urgently needed. In addition to mouse models, more suitable models using animals that can be humanized will need to be constructed. In this report, we look at the current status of model animal construction and discuss which models require further development.","mosquitoes were found in Jeju Island, South Korea. Based on their genome sequence, these mosquitos were identified as a strain of A. albopictus, a species which is known to transmit DENV, from Vietnam [5] . Until now, all cases of DENV infection in Korea have been shown to be imported, and >95% of patients had returned to Korea after being infected in Southeast Asia or South Asia. However, as the domestic climate becomes more subtropical, these subtropical insects can survive much longer, and the possible occurrence of subtropical mosquitoes may result in an influx of DENV in South Korea."
The v-sis Oncoprotein Loses Transforming Activity When Targeted to the Early Golgi Complex,"The location of autocrine interactions between the v-sis protein and PDGF receptors remains uncertain and controversial. To examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly, we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes. Fusion of a cis-Golgi retention signal from a coronavirus E1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the Golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface, resulting in efficient transformation. All chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly. Derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence, using antibodies that distinguish between the extraceUular PDGF-related domain and the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. Colocalization of sis-E1-G with Golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early Golgi complex. The sis-E1 constructs, targeted to the early Golgi complex, exhibited no proteo-lyric processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-E1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing. Treatment with suramin, a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-E1 constructs described here. Our results demonstrate that autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and PDGF receptors within the early Golgi complex do not result in functional signal transduction.","T RANSFORMATION and tumorigenesis are frequently associated with the abnormal expression of growth factors and their receptors. Many oncogenes have been shown to be homologues of normal cellular proteins, as in the case of the retroviral oncogene v-sis , which is homologous with the B chain of plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) (Doolittle et al., 1983; Waterfield et al., 1983) . Expression of the v-sis protein activates cellular PDGF receptors, resulting in the stimulation of signal transduction pathways that ultimately leads to cellular transformation."
A Case Report of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Survivor with Kidney Biopsy Results,"A 68-year old man diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presented with multiple pneumonic infiltrations on his chest X-ray, and the patient was placed on a mechanical ventilator because of progressive respiratory failure. Urinary protein excretion steadily increased for a microalbumin to creatinine ratio of 538.4 mg/g Cr and a protein to creatinine ratio of 3,025.8 mg/g Cr. The isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable serum creatinine level increased to 3.0 mg/dL. We performed a kidney biopsy 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Acute tubular necrosis was the main finding, and proteinaceous cast formation and acute tubulointerstitial nephritis were found. There were no electron dense deposits observed with electron microscopy. We could not verify the virus itself by in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy (MERS-CoV costained with dipeptidyl peptidase 4). The viremic status, urinary virus excretion, and timely kidney biopsy results should be investigated with thorough precautions to reveal the direct effects of MERS-CoV with respect to renal complications.","A Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak was reported in Korea in 2015, with high mortality (37 [19. 9%] deaths in total 186 MERS-CoV patients from May to November, 2015, from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.go.kr). Several cases of MERS-CoV infection showed renal function impairment (1,2) since MERS-CoV was isolated from a Saudi Arabian man who died of progressive respiratory and renal failure (3) . Some of those patients required renal replacement therapy. In addition, the MERS-CoV virus was detected in urine samples from a MERS-CoV patient (4) . MERS-CoV may include kidney tropism, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) was identified as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV (5) ."
Cassiae semen: A review of its phytochemistry and pharmacology (Review),"Cassiae semen (Leguminosae), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for a number of centuries in areas of Southeast Asia, including Korea, Japan and China. The present review aims to provide updated and comprehensive information, on the botany, phytochemistry and pharmacology of Cassiae semen. The available information on Cassiae semen was collected using several different resources, including classic books on Chinese herbal medicine and a number of scientific databases, including the China Academic Journals full-text database, PubMed, SciFinder, the Web of Science and Science Direct. To date >70 chemical compounds have been isolated from Cassiae semen, and the major components have been determined to be anthraquinones, naphthopyrones and volatile oil. The crude extracts and pure compounds of Cassiae semen have been used as effective agents in preclinical and clinical practice due to their beneficial activities, including antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, antioxidant and hypotensive activities. With the body of reported data, it has been suggested that Cassiae semen has convincing medicinal potential. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of the main bioactive compounds and the association between structure and activity require further investigation.","Cassiae semen, also known as ʻJuemingziʼ in Chinese, is the dry and mature seed of Cassia obtusifolia L. or C. tora L., which belong to the Cassia genus of Leguminosae (1) . It is cultivated in Korea, Japan and China, and is commonly consumed as a roasted tea (2, 3) . In traditional Chinese medicine, it has been used in treatments for hyperlipemia, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, acute liver injury, inflammation, photophobia, headache, dizziness and hypertension (4) (5) (6) ."
How urbanization affects the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases,"The world is becoming more urban every day, and the process has been ongoing since the industrial revolution in the 18th century. The United Nations now estimates that 3.9 billion people live in urban centres. The rapid influx of residents is however not universal and the developed countries are already urban, but the big rise in urban population in the next 30 years is expected to be in Asia and Africa. Urbanization leads to many challenges for global health and the epidemiology of infectious diseases. New megacities can be incubators for new epidemics, and zoonotic diseases can spread in a more rapid manner and become worldwide threats. Adequate city planning and surveillance can be powerful tools to improve the global health and decrease the burden of communicable diseases.","T he industrial revolution in the 18th century led to larger cities with greater potential for growth and development both for the individual and the community. Living in a city can provide you with several advantages, such as the possibility for higher education, a new job with higher income, the security of better health care, and the safety of social services. In 2014, the United Nations estimated that 54% of the world's population, 3.9 billion, lived in urban centres (1) . Economic growth for countries has been linked to urbanization and countries with high per capita income are among the most urbanized, whereas countries with low per capita income are the least urbanized (2) . The financial and political power is often concentrated in the cities, which leads to unique possibilities for action and quick response if needed."
Molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of diverse bovine astroviruses associated with diarrhea in cattle and water buffalo calves in China,"Astroviruses are the principal causative agents of gastroenteritis in humans and have been associated with diarrhea in other mammals as well as birds. However, astroviral infection of animals had been poorly studied. In the present study, 211 rectal swabs collected from cattle and water buffalo calves with mild to severe diarrhea were tested for bovine astrovirus (BAstV) by RT-PCR. Results: 92/211 (43.6%) samples were positive for BAstV, at a rate of 46.10% (71/154) in cattle and 36.84% (21/57) in water buffalo. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial and full-length of 25 ORF2 amino acid sequences obtained in this study classified the Guangxi BAstVs isolates into five subgroups under the genus of Mamastrovirus, genotype MAstV33, which suggested that the water buffalo was a new host of this genogroup that previously included only cattle and roe deer. Despite the origin of the host, the Guangxi BAstV isolates were closely related to the BAstV Hong Kong isolates (B18/HK and B76-2/HK), but highly divergent from the BAstV NeuroS1 isolate previously associated with neurologic disease in cattle in the U.S.A. Nucleotide sequence-based characterization of the ORF1b/ORF2 junction and corresponding overlapping regions showed distinctive properties, which may be common to BAstVs. Our results suggested that cattle and water buffalo are prone to infection of closely related astroviruses, which probably evolved from the same ancestor. The current study described astroviruses in water buffalo for the first time and is thus far among the largest epidemiological investigations of BAstV infection in cattle conducted in China.","Astroviruses are small and non-enveloped with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 6.4 to 7.3 kb in length consisting of three open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, which encodes the non-structural polyprotein 1a; ORF1b, which encodes the polyprotein 1ab, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is expressed by a ribosomal frameshift at the ORF1a/1b junction [1, 15] ; and ORF2, which encodes a viral capsid structural polyprotein. The current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) system divides the Astroviridae family into two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which infect mammals and birds, respectively [5, 21] . Astrovirus was first identified in 1975 as the causative agent of infantile diarrhea in a maternity ward in England [1] . In 2011, astrovirus infection has expanded to 22 animal species or families, including various terrestrial domestic animals, wild animals and aquatic animals, (turkey, chicken, pig, cattle, dogs, cats, deer, ducks, mink, rabbit, sea lion, bats, etc.) [3, 5, 18, 21, 24, 28] . Bovine astrovirus (BAstV) was first described in England in 1978 from acute enteritis of calves [24] and initially considered to be avirulent, as experimental infection of two gnotobiotic calves with astrovirus-like virus did not cause diarrhea [24] . However, in 1984, two bovine astrovirus isolates from the U.S.A., US1 and US2, which were found to be antigenically related to an isolate in England (U.K.), were shown to cause infection and cytopathology of M cells of the dome epithelium covering the Payer's patches of the calf ileum [25] . In addition, astroviruses in co-infection with other enteric pathogens, such as bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine torovirus (BToV; Breda virus), were shown to increase the severity of astrovirus infection [26] . In 1985, a serologically based investigation classified bovine astroviruses into two serotypes: BoAstV-1 and BoAstV-2. Meanwhile, a study on the earliest three isolates of bovine astroviruses (UK, US1 and US2) implied that these isolates were different serotypes, suggesting that multiple serotypes of bovine astroviruses may exist in nature [25] . Astroviruses, as well as noroviruses, hepatitis A and E, and rotaviruses, are commonly reported as major causes of foodborne illnesses [2] . Astroviruses are commonly detected alongside other enteric viruses, especially noroviruses in alimentary specimens. A previous study suggested that BAstV may be excreted by up to 60-100% of calves on farms [4] , but a later study showed that only 5 (2.4%) of 209 rectal swabs collected from asymptomatic adult cattle tested positive for BAstV [21] . Unlike other enteric viruses, bovine astrovirus is characterized by asymptomatic viral shedding in stool samples without heavy diarrheal disease [4, 24] ."
HIV virions sense plasma membrane heterogeneity for cell entry,"It has been proposed that cholesterol in host cell membranes plays a pivotal role for cell entry of HIV. However, it remains largely unknown why virions prefer cholesterol-rich heterogeneous membranes to uniformly fluid membranes for membrane fusion. Using giant plasma membrane vesicles containing cholesterol-rich ordered and cholesterol-poor fluid lipid domains, we demonstrate that the HIV receptor CD4 is substantially sequestered into ordered domains, whereas the co-receptor CCR5 localizes preferentially at ordered/disordered domain boundaries. We also show that HIV does not fuse from within ordered regions of the plasma membrane but rather at their boundaries. Ordered/disordered lipid domain coexistence is not required for HIV attachment but is a prerequisite for successful fusion. We propose that HIV virions sense and exploit membrane discontinuities to gain entry into cells. This study provides surprising answers to the long-standing question about the roles of cholesterol and ordered lipid domains in cell entry of HIV and perhaps other enveloped viruses.","Cell membranes consist of numerous proteins and lipids exhibiting complex behavior that includes organization into dynamic nanodomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol that are sometimes referred to as ""lipid rafts"" (1, 2) . Accumulating evidence indicates that membrane domain organization plays a vital role in cell signaling and adaptive immune responses to combat infections by many pathogens (3) (4) (5) . For example, HIV has evolved to exploit organized membrane domains to gain entry into host cells (6) (7) (8) (9) . It is well established that recognition and attachment of HIV to host cells are mediated by the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cell-surface receptor CD4 and a co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 (10, 11) . After attachment, membrane fusion mediated by subunit gp41 of the envelope glycoprotein leads to cell entry. Because CD4 has been found to associate with detergent-resistant fractions of the cell membrane, it has been assumed that cholesterol-and sphingomyelin-rich rafts are platforms for HIV entry (12, 13) . However, because lipids in cholesterolrich regions are more tightly packed and more ordered than those in the surrounding membrane, these sites may seem energetically unfavorable for membrane fusion, thereby raising doubts about the involvement of ordered lipid regions in the fusion step of HIV entry."
A nine-month-old girl with respiratory failure and rhomboencephalitis CASE PRESENTATION,"A nine-month-old girl from northern Manitoba presented in September 2014, with a three-day history of vesicular rash on the soles of her feet. She was diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, and discharged from the local nursing station. Over the next 24 h, she developed cough and fever that led to progressive vomiting, diarrhea and increased work of breathing, causing significant oxygen requirements, which led her to be transferred to a tertiary care centre. On admission, she required intubation and fluid resuscitation for respiratory failure and hypotension. On physical examination, she was afebrile. On respiratory examination, there were diffuse crackles and coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiac and abdominal examinations were normal. The only remaining rash consisted of vesicular lesions on an erythematous base on the sole of the right foot.","supportive care over the next five days. She was extubated on day 14 of admission and discharged on day 37, with residual impaired mobility of her right arm. She was seen two months after discharge with improved, but ongoing, difficulty lifting her right arm to her face, and was unable to lift her right arm above her shoulder. She is followed by physiotherapy, occupational therapy and pediatric neurology."

"Strangles, convalescent Streptococcus equi subspecies equi M antibody titers, and presence of complications Background: Streptococcus equi subspecies equi infection elicits M protein antibody titers in","Background: Streptococcus equi subspecies equi infection elicits M protein antibody titers in equids. Interpretation of titers is not generally accepted. Hypothesis: The magnitude of S. equi M protein (SeM) antibody titer after infection (titer ≥1:12 800) will be useful to monitor for the presence of complications or the risk of development of complications. Animals: Forty-eight horses on 1 farm involved in strangles outbreak. Methods: Clinical and observational study. S. equi M protein antibody titers were measured on all horses 8 weeks after infection and select horses 12 and 28 weeks after infection. Horses were categorized: no disease, uncomplicated case, persistent guttural pouch (GP) infection, or complicated cases (metastatic abscesses, purpura hemorrhagica, secondary infections, and dysphagia). Category was compared to titer. Results: Twenty-eight of 48 (58%) developed clinical signs of S. equi infection. Of those, 11 (39%) had uncomplicated strangles, 9 (21%) had persistent GP infection, 5 (18%) were complicated cases, and 3 (11%) had both persistent GP infection and complications. Thirty-three percent of horses (16 of 48) had SeM antibody titers ≥1:12 800 eight weeks after infection. Of horses with titers ≥1:12 800, 6 of 16 had evidence of complications. Of complicated cases, 6 of 8 had titers ≥1:12 800. In this outbreak, the sensitivity (75%; 95% CI [confidence interval] 45-105) for a SeM antibody titer ≥1:12 800 detecting complications was higher than the specificity (43%; 95% CI 23-64).","tions. 2 An additional objective was to follow SeM antibody titers out to 7 months after infection to determine immunoglobulin decay and to monitor for development of additional complications. We hypothesized that the magnitude of SeM antibody titer after infection (SeM titer ≥1:12 800) will be useful to monitor for the presence of complications or for the risk of development of complications. The horses that were euthanized were all complicated cases, including metastatic abscess formation, infarctive purpura hemorrhagica, secondary pleuropneumonia, and dysphagia. This reported outbreak is novel because there was a high proportion of horses with SeM antibody titers ≥1:12 800 (33%). There was also a high proportion of horses with complicated disease (29%) compared to reported complication rates (2%-20%). 1, 2, 4 In this outbreak, case fatality in complicated cases (50%) was high compared to reported case fatality in complicated cases (up to 40%). 2 Lastly, there was a high proportion of horses developing persistent GP infection (43%); this is higher than previous reports (up to 10%) 2 but consistent with a more recent report (up to 40%). 1, 4 Possible explanations for the higher complication rates and higher convalescent SeM antibody titers include a higher dose of exposure, a more virulent S. equi strain, 10, 11 Lastly, 13 horses were not tested for carrier status and were presumed not to have persistent GP infection; however, this could have led to misclassification. At initial testing for carrier status, some horses were tested only once with nasopharyngeal lavage largely based on economics; however, the current recommendations for detection of carrier status are endoscopy and GP lavage. 1, 4 This limitation could have led to underestimating the number of horses with persistent GP infection in this outbreak. It could have also led to overestimating the sensitivity and specificity of SeM antibody titers for detecting persistent GP infection as all of these horses had a SeM antibody titer ≤1:3200; however, this outbreak and other studies have indicated that SeM titers are not useful in this manner. 1, 8, 9 This outbreak illustrates the utility of SeM antibody titers after infection with S. equi. This study demonstrates that a horse may have complications of strangles without a SeM antibody titer ≥1:12 800 and that a horse may have a SeM antibody titer ≥1:12 800 without complications. A convalescent SeM antibody titer ≥1:12 800 warrants additional investigation for complications or persistent GP infection but does not necessarily confirm a horse has complicated disease."
Genetic and antigenic analysis of Chlamydia pecorum strains isolated from calves with diarrhea,"Chlamydia pecorum (designated 22-58) was isolated in 2010 in HmLu-1 cells from the jejunum of a calf which died of necrotizing enterocolitis in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Immunohistochemical staining identified C. pecorum positive reactions in the jejunal villi. C. pecorum, designated 24-100, was isolated from the feces of a calf with diarrhea in another farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture in 2012. A significant increase in neutralizing antibody titers against C. pecorum was confirmed in paired sera. Nucleotide sequence identities of omp1 genes of the 2 isolates were 100%. The isolates were genetically and antigenically more closely related to C. pecorum Bo/Yokohama strain isolated from cattle with enteritis in Japan than to the other prototype strains, Bo/Maeda isolated from cattle with pneumonia and Ov/ IPA isolated from sheep with polyarthritis. These results indicate that C. pecorum strains similar to 22-58 and 24-100 might be endemic in Yamaguchi Prefecture and cause enteric disease in cattle.","Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular bacteria that have a unique developmental cycle which includes morphological changes. They cause a wide range of diseases in animals and humans [20, 21] . The most important mode of transmission is thought to be fecal shedding by carrier animals. Chlamydiae may be shed in vaginal, ocular and nasal discharges, uterine fluid, placental tissue, urine and semen. Chlamydial infection can be acquired by direct contact between animals or by indirect transmission, such as the fecal-oral route or via inhalation of contaminated air [18] . Clarkson et al. [4] reported that Chlamydia was isolated from lamb's feces on 26 farms in England and Wales, and the prevalence of infection varied from 5-50% on individual farms. Isolates were identified as enteric type rather than abortion type and thus were classified as Chlamydia pecorum rather than Chlamydia psittaci. In cattle, C. pecorum is known to cause encephalomyelitis, pneumonia and enteritis, but subclinical and persistent infections are more common [8] . DeGraves et al. [5] reported that low-level of C. psittaci and C. pecorum genital infections was detected in 53% of virgin heifers by quantitative PCR, suggesting predominantly extra-genital transmission of Chlamydia in cattle. Reinhold et al. [17] reported that natural infections with Chlamydia spp. in calves were associated with subclinical chronic effects on animal health. Recently, it was reported that asymptomatic endemic C. pecorum infections reduced growth rates in calves by up to 48% [16] . However, the pathogenesis of C. pecorum is still unclear. In Japan, there are only a few reports of C. pecorum strains isolated from affected cattle [6] [7] [8] ."

Chloroquine could be used for the treatment of filoviral infections and other viral infections that emerge or emerged from viruses requiring an acidic pH for infectivity,"Viruses from the Filoviridae family, as many other virus families, require an acidic pH for successful infection and are therefore susceptible to the actions of 4-aminoquinolines, such as chloroquine.","The Filoviridae familycontaining Ebola and Marburg viruses comprises enveloped viruses with nonsegmented, negativesense RNA genomes, 1-3 each of which consists of seven genes forming the structural and nonstructural proteins. 1, 2 Of all filoviruses, the currently circulating Zaire species of Ebola virus (EboV) is the most virulent, with a mortality rate ranging from 59 to 88%. 1, 2 The peplomers of the EboV species are composed of trimerized heterodimers of glycoproteins 1 and 2, which are heavily glycosylated with both N-linked and O-linked glycans, and contain abundant α(2-6) and/or α(2-3) linked sialic acids. [1] [2] [3] These peplomers have broad tropism for a variety of host cells and organs as a result of their ability to bind either specifically or nonspecifically to various cell surface molecules. 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, despite this broad tropism, infection by filoviruses greatly depends on the acidic pH of the organelles internalizing the virus, 1, 2, [8] [9] [10] and therefore this characteristic can be exploited therapeutically."

The transition from oocyte to embryo requires several coordinated cellular events, including release from meiotic arrest, exocytosis of cortical granules, fusion of male and female pronuclei, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and changes in protein expression (for review see Vacquier, 1981; Whitaker, 2006a; Horner and Wolfner, 2008; Perry and Verlhac, 2008) . The developmental program and signaling cascade is initiated by a transient intracellular calcium wave released through IP 3 receptors that reside on the surface of the ER, in addition to an influx of extracellular calcium (Ridgway et al., 1977; Steinhardt et al., 1977; Gilkey et al., 1978; Busa and Nuccitelli, 1985; Miyazaki et al., 1992) . Work in many other cell types has shown that calcium is one of the most widely used signaling molecules regulating such diverse processes as neuronal signaling (Berridge, 1998) , transcription (Ikura et al., 2002) , mitochondrial function (Brookes et al., 2004) , and apoptosis (Nicotera and Orrenius, 1998) . Although it is known that calcium plays a role in numerous cellular events, it is unknown if there are additional roles for calcium during fertilization and early development."
Targeting of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Gag Precursor to the Site of Virus Budding,Retrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) matures by budding at the cell surface.,"sized Gag became rapidly and efficiently associated with membranes which had a density similar to that of plasma membrane-derived vesicles. Protease-protection studies confirmed that the Gag-containing membranes were of plasma membrane origin, since in crude cell homogenates, the bulk of newly synthesized Gag was protease-resistant as expected of a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Taken together these data indicate that targeting of M-MuLV Gag to the cell surface proceeds via direct insertion of the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, since the membrane insertion reaction is highly efficient and specific, this suggests that the reaction is dependent on as-yet-unidentified cellular factors. T he last step in the assembly of enveloped viruses is budding of the genome-containing viral core structure through a specific membrane compartment. During this process the core is wrapped into a membrane that is highly enriched in virally encoded spike proteins. Studies on genetically altered viruses have indicated that viral budding reactions can proceed by three different kinds of interactions. In the case of alphaviruses, production of enveloped particles is strictly dependent on coexpression of the core and spike proteins (33, 54) , thereby indicating that the budding reaction is driven by interactions between the cytoplasmic core and transmembrane spike proteins. The envelopment of hepadnavirus core has also been shown to require viral spike proteins (5) , but since hepadnaviral spike proteins are capable of self-assembling into subviral lipoprotein particles (50) , lateral spike-spike interactions alone in this case are evidently sufficient to induce an extrusion of a membrane vesicle. Also, the spike Please address all correspondence to H. Garoff, Department of Bioscience at Novum, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden. Tel.: 46 proteins of flaviviruses (2, 24, 34, 63) and coronaviruses (58) have been demonstrated to form subviral lipoprotein particles. Retroviruses represent yet a third type of viral budding mechanism, and in this case the viral core protein precursor Gag is capable of self-assembling into enveloped virus-like particles (9, 12, 48, 53, 62) , thereby indicating that binding of a cytoplasmic core protein into the membrane and its oligomerization into a core structure provide the driving force for retrovirus budding. Recently, it was reported that the core components of the rhabdovirus rabies virus was capable of assembling into extracellular enveloped particles in the absence of the viral spike proteins (36) ."
Mining social media and web searches for disease detection,"Web-based social media is increasingly being used across different settings in the health care industry. The increased frequency in the use of the Internet via computer or mobile devices provides an opportunity for social media to be the medium through which people can be provided with valuable health information quickly and directly. While traditional methods of detection relied predominately on hierarchical or bureaucratic lines of communication, these often failed to yield timely and accurate epidemiological intelligence. New web-based platforms promise increased opportunities for a more timely and accurate spreading of information and analysis. This article aims to provide an overview and discussion of the availability of timely and accurate information. It is especially useful for the rapid identification of an outbreak of an infectious disease that is necessary to promptly and effectively develop public health responses. These web-based platforms include search queries, data mining of web and social media, process and analysis of blogs containing epidemic key words, text mining, and geographical information system data analyses. These new sources of analysis and information are intended to complement traditional sources of epidemic intelligence. Despite the attractiveness of these new approaches, further study is needed to determine the accuracy of blogger statements, as increases in public participation may not necessarily mean the information provided is more accurate.","Social networking enables the health care industry to interact with and educate patients through social media. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are the open forum spaces in which social networks are created and maintained. Another term for a social networking platform is a social networking site, or SNS. As a forum, an SNS generally allows users to upload commentary and content onto online open space."
The Transformation of Enterovirus Replication Structures: a Three- Dimensional Study of Single-and Double-Membrane Compartments,"All positive-strand RNA viruses induce membrane structures in their host cells which are thought to serve as suitable microenvironments for viral RNA synthesis. The structures induced by enteroviruses, which are members of the family Picornaviridae, have so far been described as either single-or double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). Aside from the number of delimiting membranes, their exact architecture has also remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional electron microscopy. In this study, we used electron tomography (ET) to solve the three-dimensional (3-D) ultrastructure of these compartments. At different time points postinfection, coxsackievirus B3-infected cells were high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted for ET analysis. The tomograms showed that during the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis, closed smooth single-membrane tubules constituted the predominant virus-induced membrane structure, with a minor proportion of DMVs that were either closed or connected to the cytosol in a vase-like configuration. As infection progressed, the DMV number steadily increased, while the tubular single-membrane structures gradually disappeared. Late in infection, complex multilamellar structures, previously unreported, became apparent in the cytoplasm. Serial tomography disclosed that their basic unit is a DMV, which is enwrapped by one or multiple cisternae.","Enteroviruses (family Picornaviridae) represent a group of nonenveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that includes important human pathogens, such as poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, and rhinoviruses. Enterovirus-induced membranous structures were detected in poliovirus-infected cells by transmission electron microscopy (EM) as early as 1958 (4) , and viral RNA replication was later shown to be associated with these membranous structures (5) (6) (7) . EM showed these ""replication structures"" to be singlemembrane vesicles (4, (6) (7) (8) or double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) of heterogeneous size clustering in the perinuclear region and eventually occupying most of the cytoplasm."
Pathway and Network Approaches for Identification of Cancer Signature Markers from Omics Data,J Jo ou ur rn na al l o of f C Ca an nc ce er r 2015; 6(1): 54-65.,"A better understanding of disease associated with biomarkers could potentially start a new area for uncovering the mechanism of cancer progression, development and offer better targets for drug development [1] . Studies on single gene/protein/ metabolite molecular signatures offer limited insight into the complex interplay among the molecules responsible for progression of complex diseases such as cancer. Thus, there is a shift toward the identification of a panel of genes that interact directly or indirectly in the form of pathway or complex network to evaluate their association to cancer [2, 3] . This is accomplished through massive data derived by high throughput omic technologies such as next generation sequencing, microarray, and mass spectrometry. Although thousands of candidate biomarkers have been discovered by these technologies, few of them have been transferred into practical application in clinical setting and new drug production. The challenges lie in (1) high false positive rate of the candidate biomarkers identified from omics data; (2) Lack of attention on the study of the context of biomarkers who are interacting each other in the form of pathway or network associated with cancer; (3) Fragmental and incomplete information based on biomarkers identified from solely omics platform; (4) Lack of effective algorithms that allow integration of diverse omics data sources to simulate the biological pathway and networks. To meet these challenges, a number of pathway and network based approaches have been introduced. This review article evaluates the advantages and limitations of these methods."
Plant-made vaccines and reagents for the One Health initiative,"The One Health initiative is increasingly becoming a prominent discussion topic in animal and human health, with its focus on prevention of spread of zoonotic diseases, both in animals, and from animals to humans. An important part of One Health is that diagnostics and vaccines for diseases may be the same thingand be used for both humans and animals. One potential problem standing in the way of wider adoption of One Health principles, though, is that use of conventional cell fermentation systems for production of the recombinant proteins that could be used as diagnostics or vaccines is often expensive and is not easily scalable. A solution to this may be the use of plants or plant cells as bioreactors: molecular farming, or the production of biologics in plants, is now a well-established science with many proofs of principle and important proofs of efficacy for especially animal vaccines. This review discusses how molecular farming could enable important advances in One Health, using as examples plant-made vacccines, reagents and therapeutics for influenza viruses, ebolaviruses, rabies virus, bunyaviruses and flaviviruses.","The One Health initiative, formerly known as One Medicine, is ""…dedicated to improving the lives of all species -human and animal -through the integration of human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental science"" (http://www.onehealthini tiative.com/mission.php). It is premised on the principle that the health of the Earth's people is connected to the health of its animals and of the environment, and encourages collaboration to achieve the best health for all of these. The initiative in its modern form dates from 2007, when a formal bond was established between the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and when an International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in New Delhi urged governments to build One Health linkages for pandemic preparedness and human health security. Adoption of the principles by the European Union and the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, and support from international bodies such as the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health, mean that while it is still a virtual initiative that does not provide funding, its influence on national and international health policies is significant. 1 The importance of the approach can be seen when one realizes that 6 out of every 10 infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, or spread from animals (https://www.cdc.gov/one health/), and 7 out of 10 of emerging or re-emerging infections are vector-borne or zoonotic (http://www.onehealthinitiative. com/). There is particular interest in developing low-cost reagents for point-of-care diagnostics that could also be used as vaccines for animals and possibly also for humans, as these diseases mainly affect people and animals in developing countries, meaning that resources to study them are often lacking."
NOTE Feline coronavirus isolates from a part of Brazil: insights into molecular epidemiology and phylogeny inferred from the 7b gene,"The Feline coronavirus (FCoV) can lead to Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which the precise cause is still unknown. The theory of internal mutation suggests that a less virulent biotype of FCoV (FECV) would lead to another more pathogenic biotype (FIPV) capable of causing FIP. In this work, the 7b gene was amplified from 51 domestic cat plasma samples by semi-nested PCR and tested through phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. The 7b gene of Brazilian isolates displayed high conservation, a strong correlation between the geographic origin of the viral isolates and their genealogy, and its evolution was possibly shaped by a combination of high rates of nucleotide substitution and purifying selection.","doi: 10 .1292/jvms. jaundice, recurrent fever, iritis, or neurological signs and abdominal or pleural effusion [17, 23] ."
Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic: What Can the World Learn and Not Learn from West Africa?,"With over 4,500 deaths and counting, and new cases identified in two developed countries that are struggling and faltering in their handling of the epidemic, the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic is unlike any of its kind ever encountered. The ability of some poor, resource-limited, developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa to efficiently handle the epidemic within their shores provides some lessons learned for the global health community. Among others, the 2014 EVD epidemic teaches us that it is time to put the ""P"" back in public and population health around the world. The global health community must support a sustainable strategy to mitigate Ebola virus and other epidemics both within and outside their shores, even after the cameras are gone. Ebola virus must not be called the disease of the poor and developing world.","In September and October, 2014, the United States (US) and Spain, respectively, became the first two developed countries of the world to record the diagnoses of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in their lands outside West Africa during the current 2014 EVD epidemic. For the US, it was the nation's first case of EVD transmitted across international lines. The patient, now deceased, contracted Ebola virus and travelled to US from his native Liberia, one of the West African country at the center of what has become one of the most challenging infectious disease outbreaks and national security threats in modern times. [1, 2] The other four countries are Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. For Spain, it was the nation's first case of an indigenous Ebola virus infection for a nurse, who had earlier cared for two Spaniard missionaries who later died from the virus which they contracted in West Africa.
