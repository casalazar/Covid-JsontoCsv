Multimerization of HIV-1 integrase hinges on conserved SH3-docking platforms,"New anti-AIDS treatments must be continually developed in order to overcome resistance mutations including those emerging in the newest therapeutic target, the viral integrase (IN). Multimerization of IN is functionally imperative and provides a forthcoming therapeutic target. Allosteric inhibitors of IN bind to non-catalytic sites and prevent correct multimerization not only restricting viral integration but also the assembly and maturation of viral particles. Here, we report an allosteric inhibitor peptide targeting an unexploited SH3-docking platform of retroviral IN. The crystal structure of the peptide in complex with the HIV-1 IN core domain reveals a steric interference that would inhibit conserved docking of SH3-containing domain with the core domain vital for IN multimerization, providing a template for the development of novel anti-IN allosteric inhibitors.","In the absence of a curative treatment, the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) keeps the HIV-1 virus of AIDS patients under control. HAART combines drugs targeting different stages of viral replication including the integration step catalyzed by the integrase protein (IN) (1) . Integration of viral DNA into host genome involves two steps catalyzed by IN: (i) cleavage of a dinucleotide from each 3'-end of the viral DNA (3'processing), and (ii) insertion of this processed viral DNA into the host DNA (strand-transfer) (2) . Clinical IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) target the catalytic site of the enzyme to specifically inhibit the DNA joining reaction, however, as with all anti-AIDS treatments, the continued success of these drugs is persistently disrupted by resistance mutations (1, 2) . Although 3'-processing can be carried out by monomeric IN (3) , the assembly of IN functional multimers is imperative for the strand-transfer activity (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , and for virus particle maturation and production (reviewed in (9, 10) ). In the continued quest to identify and develop new drugs, allosteric inhibitors that bind sites outside the catalytic core and disrupt IN multimerization are emerging with potent therapeutic potential (11) (12) (13) (14) ."
Time-varying transmission dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China At a Glance Commentary Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Since,"Rationale: Several studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.","Eighteen years ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out globally, which caused more than 8000 cases with a fatality rate of 9.6% (1). Since December 2019, a pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, which was now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread throughout China and to many other countries (2) (3) (4) . As of February 9, 2020, 2019-nCoV had transmitted to 34 provinces, regions and municipal cities across China. A total of 40,235 confirmed NCP cases with 908 deaths (2.3%) and 6,484 (16.1%) critically ill cases, and there were still 23,589 suspected cases (5) ."
p53 is not necessary for DUX4 pathology,"Summary Statement: DUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion.","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) affects over 25,000 people in the U.S. alone, making it one of the most prevalent genetic diseases. The genetic mutation underlying FSHD is usually a reduction in the copy number of a macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4 referred to as D4Z4 (van Deutekom et al. 1993; Wijmenga et al. 1992 ). This repeat is GC-rich, highly methylated, and normally subjected to repeat-induced silencing, which is disrupted in an allelespecific manner by contractions to 10 or fewer copies (van Overveld et al. 2003) or on all D4Z4 repeats by mutation in the chromatin protein SMCHD1 (de Greef et al. 2009; Hartweck et al. 2013 ; Lemmers et al. 2012) . When silencing at D4Z4 breaks down, an RNA transcript encoding the DUX4 protein (Gabriels et al. 1999 ) is expressed. The presence of a poly(A) signal downstream of the D4Z4 repeats on chr4 (Dixit et al. 2007 ) leads to DUX4 expression and explains why disease is associated only with contractions of the D4Z4 repeats on chr4, and only on specific 4qter alleles, so called permissive alleles, which harbor the poly(A) signal (Lemmers et al. 2010; Lemmers et al. 2004 ). The DUX4 protein has been observed by immunostaining of cultured FSHD myoblasts which show infrequent, possibly episodic, expression (Jones et al. 2012; Snider et al. 2010 ) and differentiated myotubes which show more prevalent expression (Block et al. 2013; Rickard, Petek and Miller 2015) ."
Virological assessment of hospitalized cases of coronavirus disease 2019 *equal contribution **senior authors with equal contribution,"emerged in late 2019 1,2 . Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe-, and 6.1% with critical courses 3 . This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung 2,4 . By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity but also aided the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 5 . However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting a potential for pre-or oligosymptomatic transmission 6-8 .","Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 X 10 8 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat-and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat-and lung samples of one same patient. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 6-12 days, but was not followed by a rapid decline of viral loads. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness."
Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","(2.2 with 90% high density interval 1.4-3.8 (Riou and Althaus, 2020) or 2.7 with a 95% CrI of 2.47-2.86 (Wu et al., 2020) ). Higher estimates have also been reported (Sanche et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Importantly, R 0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen, but is affected by factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of infected individuals. One such environmental factor is climate which modulates transmissibility throughout the year. As a result, many respiratory viruses show clear seasonal variation in prevalence; the most well-known example being seasonal influenza which peaks every winter in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere (Petrova and Russell, 2018) . A similar pattern is seen for the four seasonal human coronaviruses: HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E (hereafter collectively referred to as ""seasonal CoVs"") (Al-Khannaq et al., 2016; Friedman et al., 2018; Galanti et al., 2019; Góes et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2017; Killerby et al., 2018) . These viruses cause respiratory infections which usually are mild and primarily affect young children."

Clinical Features of COVID-19-Related Liver Damage,"with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely . Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay.","Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the pathogen to cause pneumonia in Wuhan, China , which was temporarily named as 2019-nCoV by WHO. 2, 3 On 11 February 2020, based on the phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, 2019-nCoV was officially named as SARS-CoV-2, 4 and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19 . 5 Evidence has proven that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact , posing a huge challenge on the public health. 6 Up to now, there were more than seventy thousand confirmed cases and two thousand death case in 30 countries around the world. 7 The main manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, dry cough, weakness, and breathing difficulty. Abnormal liver functions were frequently reported extrapulmonary clinical feature and almost one half of patients experienced different degrees of liver function damage. 8, 9 .According to the recent study of single-cell RNAseq , angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)2 was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in bile duct cells. 10 Importantly, recent study confirmed that the cell entry receptor of 2019-nCoV, like SARS-CoV, is ACE2 receptor. 11 All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the bile duct cells and cause the abnormal liver function in these patients. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the bile duct injury related index, was not specific in COVID-19 patients . 8, 9 .A recent pathological finding reported that moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were present in liver biopsy specimens, indicating that the liver injury could be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 12 Currently, however, there is no any clinical research to analyze whether abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients is due to the drugs used or not. Given the high contagious and pathogenic capacities of SARS-CoV-2 and high incidence of liver damage, an analysis with liver function in COVID patients is urgently warranted."
Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus,"Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections [1] . In the past 2 decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality [2] . For example, 8,098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion [3, 4] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2,494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia [2] . In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was found in Wuhan, China. As of February 02, 2020, there have been over 14,000 cases with ~300 deaths for the 2019-nCoV pandemic (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html); furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts [5] .

Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is closely associated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients.","The novel coronavirus disease , which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, has been called as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] [2] [3] . The disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to other areas. Compared with two other WHO blueprint priority coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is lethal 4 . As of February 25, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has led to 2663 deaths in China base on the report from National Health Commission of China."
Projecting the end of the Zika virus epidemic in Latin America: a modelling analysis,"International Concern following a cluster of associated neurological disorders and neonatal malformations. In 2017, Zika cases declined, but future incidence in LAC remains uncertain due to gaps in our understanding, considerable variation in surveillance and a lack of a comprehensive collation of data from affected countries.","Starting as early as 2013, 1 has since spread to 49 countries and territories across the Americas where autochthonous transmission has been confirmed. 3 However, 2017 saw a marked decline in reported Zika cases and its severe disease manifestations. 4 This decline has been widely attributed to the build-up of immunity against ZIKV in the wider human population, 5 although it remains unknown how many people have been infected. To date, there has been limited use of population-based surveys to determine the circulation and seroprevalence of ZIKV in LAC, owing to challenges in interpretation of serological tests that cross-react with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue). 6, 7 In addition to the reduction in Zika cases there has also been a marked reduction in incidence of reported dengue and chikungunya cases in Brazil, meaning that the role of climatic, and other factors affecting mosquito density, or cross-immunity between arboviruses cannot be ruled out."
Relations of parameters for describing the epidemic of COVID-19 by the Kermack-McKendrick model,"In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID-19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/τ grow =1/τ trans −1/τ inf , where τ grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, τ trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time τ inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(∞ ) ≈ 1− exp(− (R 0 − 1)/0.60) is the relation between p(∞ ), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society, and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/τ end =","We reported the understanding of the present status and forecasting of pneumonia by in China which is supposed to have originated in Wuhan by analyzing the data up to February 11 (ref.1). In ref. 1 , we clarified that the behavior of the epidemic was different in different regions and that the outbreak was well described by a Gaussian as was for influenza in Japan. We reported the following; 1. the epidemic in China passed the peak in the beginning of February, 2. the date of the epidemic peak was different by region and was the latest in Wuhan. For more than 10 days after our forecast, the epidemic closely followed our forecast. The new patients outside Wuhan decreased to less than 4 % of that at the peak around February 5."
Title: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in Malawi: Implementation Gaps and Challenges for Timely Alert Submit journal: PLoS ONE,Objective: The emerging and recent 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks rang the bell to call upon efforts from globe to assist resource-constrained countries to strengthen public health surveillance system for early response. Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening.,"After the largest Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) outbreak happened in Western Africa, governments, health authorities in Africa and the world learnt a valuable lesson from the challenges of diseases surveillance systems implementations in countries with limited public health infrastructure [1, 2] ."
A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells,"The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from 2 China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, 3 called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe 5 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 6 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein 7 from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. 8 However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, 9 control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed 10 between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association 11 can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a 12 multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new 13 virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data 14 obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between 15 virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in 16 host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that 17 the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, 18 while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our 19 computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible 20 explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 author/funder.

It has been found that the replicated RNA genome and synthesized viral proteins are finally assembled together into 10 new viruses, before they escape and attack other cells [7, 8] . As a result, the infections of 11 2019-nCoV normally come with the similar symptoms as SARS, including fever, 12 respiratory difficulty and pneumonia [9, 10] . Different from SARS, however, the new 13 COVID-19 seems to have longer incubation period and thus is more contagious [11] . The 14 disease has caused more than 70,000 confirmed cases with at least 1000 death globally, 15 according to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 16 th 2020. 16 Therefore, the development of vaccine or therapeutic treatment for this ongoing public 17 health crisis is highly demanding [12, 13] . 18 Almost all the coronaviruses recognize their host cells through spike (S) proteins 19 [14, 15] . S-protein is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of viral envelop as homo-20 trimers [16] . Each S-protein further consists of two subunits. The S1 subunit includes a 21 region called receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is used to target receptors in host 22 cells, while the S2 subunit regulates the membrane fusion between virus and host cells 23 [17] . These roles of S protein suggest that it could be a key target for vaccine and 24 therapeutics developed to neutralize virus infection by blocking their invasion [18] . 25 Moreover, it has been confirmed in a recent report that the new virus 2019-nCoV uses the 26 same cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS coronavirus [19] . The atomic structures of 27 complex between human ACE2 and the RBD regions from S-protein of SARS-CoV have 28 been obtained by x-ray crystallography [17] . It was also shown that the sequence of S-29 protein from SARS-CoV shares more than 70% identity with the S-protein from 2019-30 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak: an observational and modelling study,The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World.,"could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020."
Title: ACP risk grade: a simple mortality index for patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) during the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan,Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease,"Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients."
ZODIAC: database-independent molecular formula annotation using Gibbs sampling reveals unknown small molecules,"The condent high-throughput identication of small molecules remains one of the most challenging tasks in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. SIRIUS has become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectra, and shows outstanding performance for identifying the molecular formula of a query compound, being the rst step of structure identication. Nevertheless, the identication of both molecular formulas for large compounds above 500 Daltons and novel molecular formulas remains highly challenging. Here, we present ZODIAC, a network-based algorithm for the de novo estimation of molecular formulas. ZODIAC reranks SIRIUS' molecular formula candidates, combining fragmentation tree computation with Bayesian statistics using Gibbs sampling. Through careful algorithm engineering, ZODIAC's Gibbs sampling is very swift in practice. ZODIAC decreases incorrect annotations 16.2-fold on a challenging plant extract dataset with most compounds above 700 Dalton; we then show improvements on four additional, diverse datasets. Our analysis led to the discovery of compounds with novel molecular formulas such as C 24 H 47 BrNO 8 P which, as of today, is not present in any publicly available molecular structure databases.","For all ve datasets, we observe that ZODIAC outperforms SIRIUS, often substantially decreasing molecular formula annotation error rates (Fig. 1, left) . We rst consider the dendroides dataset, for which improvements are most distinctive: This dataset contains many larger compounds, and 75 % of the ground truth compounds have an m/z of 605 or higher ( Supplementary Fig. 6 )."
Correlation Analysis Between Disease Severity and Inflammation-related Parameters in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Aim: The new coronavirus pneumonia outbreaking at the end of 2019 is highly contagious. Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early.",Critical patients should have any of the following conditions:
Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of ""resumption of work"", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, with a spherical shape and crown-like spines, from which their name derives. They generally cause mild respiratory infections but can sometimes be fatal. Since their first discovery and molecular characterization, three major spread out globally [2 ,6, 8, 11] , causing approximately 80,000 cases and 2,400 deaths as of February 22 nd 2020 [13] ."
Profiling the immune vulnerability landscape of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"The outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread from Wuhan, China to multiple countries, causing staggering number of infections and deaths. A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies. We create an online database to broadly share our research outcome. Overall, we present an immunological resource for 2019-nCoV that could significantly promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research.","In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, China (1). 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to other regions of China, and multiple other countries, with a contagious speed that is much higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (2) . Despite the lower mortality rate of 2019-nCoV compared with SARS and MERS, the scale of the 2019-nCoV contagion has already caused more casualties than either of them, as of this writing. Early research into 2019-nCoV has mostly described its epidemiological features (1, 3), reported the possible curative effect of remdesivir (4) , and characterized its basic genomics features (5, 6) ."
Real-Time Estimation of the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection: Inference Using Exported Cases,"The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection that were confirmed outside of China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January, 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.","Since 8 December, 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology have emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] . Virological investigation suggests that the causative agent of this pneumonia is a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) [3] . As of 27 January, 2020, a total of 4515 cases including 106 deaths were confirmed [4] . Forty-one cases of COVID-19 infections were also reported outside China, in other Asian countries, the United States, France, Australia, and Canada."
Potentially highly potent drugs for 2019-nCoV,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 and has rapidly spread around the world. By Feb 5, 2020, more than 24000 individuals were infected and more than 490 fatalities had been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no specific antiviral drug for this epidemic. Considering the severity of this widespread dissemination and health threats, panic patients misled by media flocked to the pharmacies for Chinese Medicine herbs which were reported to ""inhibit"" the 2019-nCoV, despite no clinical evidence supporting the claim. Many researchers are engaged in developing anti-2019-nCoV drug s [1, 2] . However, new drug discovery and development is a long, costly and rigorous scientific process. A more effective approach is to search for anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drug database."
Inferring the presence of aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus flavus strains using 3 RNA sequencing and electronic probes as a transcriptomic screening tool 4 5 6,"20 E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally 21 developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, 22 enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed 23 detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific 24 pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, 25 e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, 26 EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes 27 related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from 28 genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene 29 transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where 30 aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being 31 used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 32 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth). 33 34 Maize [1], peanuts [2], tree nuts, dried spices [3] and cottonseed [4] are crops that can 35 be infected during the pre-harvest, post-harvest and/or storage period with Aspergillus 36 flavus Link.

Title Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases,"Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.","On December 31, 2019, the Health Commission in Wuhan, China, announced 27 cases of viral pneumonia.

"The Role of Proton Transport in Gating Current in a Voltage Gated Ion Channel, as Shown by Quantum Calculations","Over two-thirds of a century ago, Hodgkin and Huxley proposed the existence of voltage gated ion channels (VGIC) to carry Na + and K + ions across the cell membrane to create the nerve impulse, in response to depolarization of the membrane.

Classification: Biological Sciences Minor: Microbial Biology Site specific target binding controls RNA cleavage efficiency by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus endonuclease SOX,"During lytic replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the gene expression landscape of a cell is remodeled to evade the immune response and create an environment favorable to viral replication. A major driver of these gene expression changes is a virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific endonuclease termed SOX. SOX cleaves the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but does so at specific internal sites loosely defined by a degenerate sequence motif. If and how RNA sequence directs SOX targeting remained unknown. To address these questions, we used recombinant, highly purified SOX endonuclease in a series of biochemical assays to reconstitute the cleavage reaction in vitro and gain significant insight into the biochemical mechanism of both SOX target recognition and endonucleolytic cleavage. Using this system, we determined that cut site specificity is preserved with purified SOX and a validated target RNA and thus does not require additional cellular cofactors. Furthermore, we showed that . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of target RNA susceptibility observed in cells.","Viral infection dramatically reshapes the gene expression landscape of the host cell. By changing overall messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance or translation, viruses can redirect host machinery towards viral gene expression while simultaneously dampening immune stimulatory signals (1) (2) (3) . Suppression of host gene expression, termed host shutoff, can occur via a variety of mechanisms, but one common strategy is to accelerate degradation of mRNA (1, 2) . This occurs during infection with DNA viruses such as In cells, the mRNA fragments resulting from the primary SOX endonucleolytic cleavage are predominantly cleared by the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, while in vitro, RNA fragments are rapidly degraded by 5'-3' exonucleolytic activity intrinsic to purified SOX (9) . Thus, it has been challenging to analyze the initial endonucleolytic cleavage event that is an essential component of mRNA target specificity in vivo. Here, we sought to develop a biochemical system to address these questions."
The Viral Protein Corona Directs Viral Pathogenesis and Amyloid Aggregation,"Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ42), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies. doi: bioRxiv preprint HSV-1 is an example of another virus with high prevalence, infecting nearly 70% of the human population 17 .","The term ""protein corona"" refers to the layer of proteins that adhere to the surfaces of nanostructures when they encounter biological fluids. Nanoparticles adsorb biomolecules in biological fluids due to the high free energy of their surfaces 1 . The importance of the corona layer stems from the fact that it constitutes the actual surface of interaction with biological membranes or ""what the cell sees"" in the in-vivo context 2 . Hundreds of proteins have been identified to confer a distinct biological identity of nanoparticles in different microenvironments depending on their size, chemistry and surface modification (recently reviewed in 3 ). These factors were found to be critical determinants of the biodistribution and pharmacodynamics of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the ability of the surfaces of nanoparticles to partially denature certain corona proteins exposing ""cryptic epitopes"" highlights the role of the protein corona in the toxicology of nanoparticles [4] [5] [6] . The formation of a protein corona is particularly important in the context of nanoparticle interaction with amyloidogenic peptides such as amyloid beta (Aβ42) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which are associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 disease, respectively. Nanoparticles have been shown to catalyze amyloid formation via binding of amyloidogenic peptides in their corona, thereby increasing local peptide concentration and inducing conformational changes that facilitate fibril growth via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism 7, 8 . This surface-assisted (heterogenous) nucleation has been demonstrated for several nanoparticles with different amyloidogenic peptides including IAPP and Aβ42 9,10 ."

Stress-induced phospho-ubiquitin formation causes parkin degradation,"Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin are the most common known cause of autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Multiple types of stress decrease parkin protein levels, an effect that may be relevant to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism(s) involved in this loss remain largely unclear. We sought to elucidate these mechanisms using a PD-relevant stressor, L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as toxic quinones via auto-oxidation. We find that L-DOPA causes parkin loss through both an oxidative stress-independent and an oxidative stress-dependent pathway. Characterization of the latter reveals that it requires both the kinase PINK1 and parkin's interaction with phosphorylated ubiquitin (phospho-Ub) and is mediated by proteasomal degradation.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, affecting roughly 2% of those over the age of 80 [1] . Though most cases of PD appear to be ""sporadic"", a minority of cases have a clear autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance pattern [2] . The most common known cause of autosomal recessive PD is homozygous inactivation of PARK2, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin [3] . Parkin has been demonstrated to promote cell survival in many different contexts [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . There is also evidence that parkin loss may play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD [21] [22] [23] . As such, strategies aimed at upregulating parkin levels or maintaining it in an active state hold therapeutic promise for sporadic PD [16] , [24] [25] [26] ."
Significance of hydrophobic and charged sequence similarities in sodium-bile acid cotransporter and vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor,"Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","The sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also defined the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) or also liver bile acid transporter, is an integral transmembrane protein that is encoded by the SLC10A1 (solute carrier family 10, member 1) human gene and shows multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains (1) . This transporter plays a critical role in maintenance of the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and hepatocyte function. The protein is constituted by 349 aminoacids with a resulting molecular mass of 56 kDa and works by binding two sodium ions and one (conjugated) bile salt molecule, in this manner determining hepatic influx of bile salts. Other molecules that may be transported by this protein comprise steroid and thyroid hormones, and xenobiotics of different origin (2) . NTCP also represents the receptor for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the interaction between the aminoacid sequences of NTCP and those of HBV surface proteins has been characterized in molecular details. The preS1 sequence of large envelope protein (L) is essential for interaction with a stretch of nine hydrophobic residues (157-KGIVISLVL-165) located in the third transmembrane domain of NTCP. The sequence of the preS1 L protein binding NTCP is constituted by a stretch of predominantly hydrophobic aminoacids (residues 2-48) and, within this stretch, there is a highly conserved motif (9-NPLGF(F/L)P-15) that is essential for binding (3) . It is apparent that knowledge of the mechanics of interaction at this level may be instrumental in developing strategies aimed at preventing preS1/NTCP interaction with consequent internalization. We therefore decided to use computational tools to investigate sequence similarities in other proteins that may interact with the preS1 sequence as well as with other surface proteins of viruses. To this end, we chose a well-characterized multifunctional serum protein that has the ability to work as a transporter, a hormone-and fatty acid binding protein, and an immune stimulating cytokine, the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) macrophage activating factor (MAF). This is a serum alpha-2 glycoprotein constituted by a single polypeptide chain showing a molecular mass of 51-58 kDa. From the structural point of view, it is related to serum albumin and it is also known as Gc (Group-component) globulin. DBP synthesis occurs in the liver and its level in human plasma is around 20-55 mg/100 ml. DBP is a multifunctional protein that, in addition to vitamin D, binds actin, acting as an actin scavenger, and also binds fatty acids. The protein is constituted by 458 aminoacids and shows three domains that share limited sequence similarity with each other as well as with similar sequences of human albumin. The first domain contains the vitamin D-binding site that is located in a shallow cleft that allows interaction with the plasma membrane. DBP is present on the surface of several cell types that comprise yolk sac endodermal cells and T lymphocytes. In B lymphocytes, DBP is responsible for the linkage of surface immunoglobulins, thus contributing to the balance of the immune response (4). The de-glycosylated form of DBP is a powerful macrophage activating factor -hence the designation DBP-MAF -and shows a number of biological effects (5) . We demonstrated that, in addition to its presence in human serum, DBP-MAF is formed during fermentation of milk and colostrum (6) as well as during fermentation of hemp seed proteins (7). Here, we demonstrate that DBP-MAF shares significant similarities with hydrophobic sequences of NTCP that interact with the preS1 sequence of L protein. We also show that DBP-MAF, but not NTCP, shares similarities between the hydrophobic sequence of the fatty acid binding site and the domain IV of the same L protein. Finally, we show the .

Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial 1 diseases 2,"Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public 12 health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne 13 pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; 14 however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are 15 both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-16 222 nm) efficiently kills bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its 17 strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) 18 layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller 19 dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them.

Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus,"The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene.","In less than two months since initially reported in mid-December 2019, the recent coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has caused more than 900 fatalities associated with severe respiratory disease.

,"Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58, 956 [90% CI 40,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 -7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","Starting in December 2019, Chinese health authorities have been closely monitoring a cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province.

"Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing: A flexible, generalizable model for real-time epidemic tracking","Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. ""Nowcast"" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission-that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases-and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to timevarying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package ""NobBS"") for widespread application.","Effective public health action relies on surveillance that is timely and accurate, especially in disease outbreaks (1, 2) . Specifically, surveillance provides the information required to assess risks, prioritize and allocate resources to public health threats, deploy and discontinue interventions to interrupt transmission, and monitor the impact of those interventions. Ideally, disease surveillance systems should closely track the often fast-changing circumstances of outbreaks, distinguishing true changes in the dynamics from artifacts of reporting."
Evolutionary proteomics uncovers ciliary signaling components 1 2,"Cilia are organelles specialized for movement and signaling. To infer when during animal 24 evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the proteomes of 25 cilia from three organisms: sea urchins, sea anemones and choanoflagellates. From these 26 ciliomes, we identified 437 high confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals, 27 including known regulators of Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling. The phylogenetic profiles 28 of their ciliary association indicate that the Hh and GPCR pathways were linked to cilia before 29 the origin of bilateria and TRP channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that some 30 of the candidates not previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further 31 investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein that we identified in the cilia of all three 32 organisms. In animals, ENKUR is expressed by cells with motile cilia, ENKUR localizes to cilia 33 in diverse organisms and, in both Xenopus laevis and mice, ENKUR is required for patterning 34 the left/right axis. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes situs inversus in humans.

Despite extensive vaccination, IBV poses a continued economic threat to the poultry industry. The primary site of IBV infection is the epithelium of the respiratory tract; however IBV can spread to other sites including the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, reproductive organs and Harderian glands (2, 9) . Viremia has been suggested as a way for internal spread, as evidenced by detection of virus in the blood of infected chickens (3, 5) . However, the mechanism remains unknown. Other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome--coronavirus (4) and feline coronavirus (10) , exhibit well recognized systemic infection, with monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells originating from a common myeloid progenitor disseminating the virus and acting as an important immunopathogenic component in disease (8) ."

Salt Effects on the Thermodynamics of a Frameshifting RNA Pseudoknot under Tension,"Because of the potential link between −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting and response of a pseudoknot (PK) RNA to force, a number of single molecule pulling experiments have been performed on PKs to decipher the mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces (f s) and monovalent salt concentrations (Cs). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states.","The multifarious roles RNA molecules play in controlling a myriad of cellular functions [1] have made it important to understand in quantitative terms their folding [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and how they respond to external stresses [7] . Among them, one of the simplest structural motifs is the RNA pseudoknot (PK), which is involved in many biological functions. The simplest type, referred to as H-type PK, consists of two stems connected by two loops in which one of the stems forms base pairs with the loop of the other. The PK motif, found in many RNA molecules such as telomerase [8] , mRNA [9] , ribosomal RNA [10] , transfer-messenger RNA, and viral RNA [11] , is functionally important [12] . For instance, a PK in the human telomerase RNA is essential for enzyme (a ribonucleoprotein complex) activity [13] . Many pathogenic mutations in the human telomerase RNA are found in the wellconserved PK region of the RNA, further underscoring the importance of the PK [8, 13] . The presence of PKs is also important in ribozyme catalysis and inhibition of ribosome translation."
TALC: Transcription Aware Long Read Correction,"Long-read sequencing technologies are invaluable for determining complex RNA transcript architectures but are error-prone. Numerous ""hybrid correction"" algorithms have been developed for genomic data that correct long reads by exploiting the accuracy and depth of short reads sequenced from the same sample. These algorithms are not suited for correcting more complex transcriptome sequencing data.","Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have revealed that transcription is more pervasive (1) , more diverse (2) and more cryptic (3) than expected (4) (5) (6) . Given the major role that RNA processing plays in disease and normal biology, it is crucial to ascertain the existence of novel isoforms and to accurately quantify their abundance. Second generation RNA-seq technologies such as Illumina are well suited to the tasks of assessing gene expression levels and determining proximal exon connectivity. They produce numerous sequencing reads at a low cost ensuring sufficient representation of most transcripts. However, because the RNA or cDNA is fragmented during short RNA-seq protocols, long range connectivity can only be computationally inferred. These predictions based on short reads struggle to correctly identify transcript isoforms that contain multiple alternative exons (7) or that contain retained introns (8, 9) . In these cases, long-read (LR) sequencing technologies are invaluable because they can sequence entire molecules in one pass and thus capture long-range connectivity of complex isoforms."

Screening of FDA-approved drugs using a MERS-CoV clinical isolate from South Korea identifies potential therapeutic options for COVID-19,"In 2015, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea, resulting from nosocomial transmission, and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-ofaddition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early-and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","patients in the late stage of infection (Omrani et al., 2014; Shalhoub et al., 2014; Spanakis et al., 2014) . These results suggest that the administration of broad-spectrum antivirals to MERS patients is effective at some points during infection, although a specific treatment for MERS-CoV may be required full antiviral activity."
"RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain and is required for ubiquitination E-mail: Gracjan.Michlewski@ed.ac.uk Running Title: RNA-binding protein TRIM25 KEYWORDS: Novel RNA-binding proteins, TRIM25, RNA-protein interactions, RNA- binding domain, PRY/SPRY","TRIM25 is a novel RNA-binding protein and a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response. Almost nothing is known about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. Here, we reveal that RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain.","More than 300 novel RNA-binding proteins have been identified in HeLa (Castello et al., 2012) , HEK293 (Baltz et al., 2012) and mouse ES cells (Kwon et al., 2013) . Furthermore, a recent study identified 393 new RNA-binding proteins unique to cardiomyocytes (Liao et al., 2016) . Strikingly, many of these proteins were not previously known for their RNA-binding properties and do not contain canonical RNA-binding domains. Intriguingly, E3 ubiquitin ligases from the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family (TRIM25, TRIM56 and TRIM71) are among these newly identified RNA-binding proteins. TRIM proteins have a characteristic architecture that includes RING zinc-finger, B-Box, coiled-coil (CC) and variable C-terminal domains. There are over 80 TRIM proteins in the human genome, and they have been divided into 11 subfamilies based on their structural composition (Versteeg et al., 2013) . The largest subfamily (C-IV) of 33 TRIM proteins is characterized by the PRY/SPRY domain at the Cterminal end. Most the proteins from the TRIM family are involved in innate immune responses (Jefferies et al., 2011; Rajsbaum et al., 2014; van Tol et al., 2017) . For example, TRIM25 plays a role in the RIG-I-mediated interferon response to viral RNAs (Ozato et al., 2008; Versteeg et al., 2013) . RIG-I recognizes viral RNA molecules with a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp-RNA) (Yoneyama et al., 2004) and initiates a downstream signaling cascade that culminates with the expression of type I interferons (interferon α and β ) (Loo and Gale, 2011) and an anti-viral response. TRIM25 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which leads to efficient recruitment of its downstream partners. Such recruitment in turn triggers the interferon response (Gack et al., 2007) . Recently, TRIM25 was shown to be required for the antiviral activity of RNA-binding Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) Zheng et al., 2017) . Almost nothing is known about the RNA-mediated roles and characteristics of these RNA-binding E3 ligases."
Single-cell Analysis of ACE2 Expression in Human Kidneys and Bladders Reveals a Potential Route of 2019-nCoV Infection,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month.","In late December 2019, a cluster of mystery pneumonia cases emerged in Wuhan, a city in the middle south of China. Deep sequencing analysis and etiological investigations then confirmed the pathogen was a type of a newly identified coronavirus which had been labelled as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The rapid spread of 2019-nCoV caused the outbreak of pneumonia in China and also other countries, making it a severe threat to international public health security within a short period of time [1] [2] [3] ."
,"The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to national regions and multiple other countries, thus, pose a serious threat to public health. Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.","The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. According to the World Health Organization on February 24th 16, about 77,269 viral infected patients and at least 2596 deaths were confirmed globally."
Title: Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes Short title: Automated tool for phylogenetic and mutational analysis of coronaviruses genomes,"Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.","We are currently faced with a potential global epidemic of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people in China and is spreading rapidly around the world. This week the WHO has declared it an global emergency (WHO, 2020) . The Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and 2003. The virus is a SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), and it is genetically associated with SARSr-CoV strains that infect bats in China . It causes severe respiratory illness, has high fatality rate , can be transmitted from person to person and has spread to over 15 countries in less than two months (WHO, 2020) ."
Rapid colorimetric detection of COVID-19 coronavirus using a reverse tran- scriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) diagnostic plat- form: iLACO,"The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.","In December 2019, the first case of cluster unidentified pneumonia was found in Wuhan, named 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a beta subtype, highly homologous with SARS(1). As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmed cases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavy pres-sure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others (2) . Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infected individuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread."
In-silico immune cell deconvolution of the airway proteomes of infants with pneumonia reveals a link between reduced airway eosinophils and an increased risk of mortality,"Rationale: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in infants and young children. The mechanisms that lead to mortality in these children are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of pneumonia. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data.","Pneumonia is a leading cause of paediatric mortality word-wide. A recent study on the global burden of paediatric pneumonia conducted in seven countries found that viruses account for about 61% of all paediatric pneumonia infections, while about 27% of infection were attributed to bacterial pathogens, with RSV accounting for the largest etiological fraction of paediatric pneumonia 1 . More than 90% of the deaths that occur due to pneumonia in children under 5, occur in low resource settings, mainly due to the lack of paediatric intensive care facilities 2 . Very young infants especially those with comorbidities such as HIV and malnutrition have a poor survival prognosis following pneumonia infection. HIV-infected infants who develop a pneumonia infection are up to 10 times more likely to die from the infection than non-HIV infected children 3 , while those with malnutrition are more than 15 times more likely to die after admission 4 . The damage to the lungs caused by severe pneumonia appears to persist even after discharge from hospital, with recent estimates showing that post-discharge mortality in African children previously admitted to hospital with pneumonia being eight times greater than those discharged with other diagnoses 5 ."
Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein reveals a proteolytically- sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS- like coronaviruses,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module.","The coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and the Orthocoronaviridae subfamily, which is divided in four genera; Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and"
Title: Risk for Transportation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan to Cities in China,"On January 23, 2020, China quarantined Wuhan to contain an emerging coronavirus . We estimated the probability of transportation of COVID-19 from Wuhan to 369 cities in China before the quarantine. The expected risk is >50% in 130 (95% CI 89-190) cities and >99% in the 4 largest metropolitan areas of China.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China (1). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (2). By January 31, 2020, 192 fatalities and 3,215 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan; 8,576 additional cases were spread across >300 cities in mainland China; and 127 exported cases were reported in 23 countries/states spanning Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America. The rapid global expansion, rising fatalities, unknown animal reservoir, and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential (3, 8) initially resembled the 2003 SARS epidemic and raised concerns about global spread."
"Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers","Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore.","2 may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold."
"Estimating number of global importations of COVID-19 from Wuhan, risk of transmission outside mainland China and COVID-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland China",Background,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China."
Evolutionary origins of epidemic potential among human RNA viruses,"To have epidemic potential, a pathogen must be able to spread in human populations, but of human-infective RNA viruses only a minority can do so. We investigated the evolution of human transmissibility through parallel analyses of 1755 virus genome sequences from 39 RNA virus genera. We identified 57 lineages containing human-transmissible species and estimated that at least 74% of these lineages have evolved directly from non-human viruses in other mammals or birds, a public health threat recently designated ""Disease X"". Humantransmissible viruses rarely evolve from virus lineages that can infect but not transmit between humans. This result cautions against focussing surveillance and mitigation efforts narrowly on currently known human-infective virus lineages and supports calls for a better understanding of RNA virus diversity in non-human hosts.","The relative frequencies of L1-L2, L1-L3/4 and L2-L3/4 transitions varied across genera, 101 families and genome types (Figures 3b-d, Table S2 ). The odds of L1-L3/4 relative to L1-L2 (Table   112 S3, Figure S4 ). There was no indication that L2 viruses tended to arise earlier in lineages than 113 L3/4 viruses. Nor was there a consistent trend towards evolutionary recent (as measured by 114 relative node depth) increases in the number of viruses entering human populations. We also 115 estimated the instantaneous transition rates between IT level (see Supplementary Materials). 116 The rates of L2-L3/4 transitions were not higher than the rates of L1-L3/4 transitions ( Figure   117 3g, Table S4 ). This implies that the distributions of values of parameters a and c in our (Table S4) ."

Identification of a Zika NS2B-NS3pro pocket susceptible to allosteric inhibition by small molecules including qucertin rich in edible plants,"It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika virus, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine available. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication. Very recently we identified two small molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode, with Ki values of 0.57 and 2.02 µM respective for p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate and qucertin. Here, by molecular docking, we show that although one is designed compound while another is a natural product, both molecules bind to the same pocket on the back of the substratebinding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As the two inhibitors fundamentally differ from cn-716, the only known peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor in both structure scaffolds and inhibitory modes, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes. Furthermore, as qucertin is abundant in many vegetables and fruits such caper, lovage, tea and red onion, our results should benefit the public to immediately fight Zika virus. author/funder.

Structure of M pro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors,"A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible 31 for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan 1-4 . Currently there 32 is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to 33 rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined 34 structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to 35 identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M pro ). M pro is a key 36 CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, 37 making it an attractive drug target for this virus 5,6 . Here, we identified a mechanism-based 38 inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal 39 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with this compound. Next, through a 40 combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 41 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other 42 pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M pro . Six of these inhibit M pro with 43 IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. Ebselen also exhibited strong antiviral activity 44 in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which 45 can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new 46 infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. 47 48 author/funder.

The COVID-19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000 51 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, 52 required for viral replication and transcription 3,4 . The functional polypeptides are released 53 from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8-kDa 54 main protease (M pro ), also referred to as the 3C-like protease. M pro digests the polyprotein 55 at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself 56 from pp1a and pp1ab 8 . The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle, together 57 with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the M pro as an attractive 58 target for antiviral drug design 9 . 59 To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we 60 developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and 61 high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID-19 virus M pro . 62 Establishing a high-throughput activity assay 63 Recombinant COVID-19 virus M pro with native N and C termini was expressed in 64 Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b).

Getting to zero quickly in the 2019-nCov epidemic with vaccines or rapid testing,"Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by onetime vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients.

We began with 111 MET and RAP due to their translational importance in humans 14,27 . However, RAP combined with 112 MET at their optimal doses did not show any further benefit on lifespan (Extended data Fig. 2j,p). We 113 carried out additional trials, exploring all possible combinations of optimal and half-optimal dose for 114 MET and RAP (Extended data Fig. 2j-p).

In silico Design of novel Multi-epitope recombinant Vaccine based on Coronavirus surface 2 glycoprotein 3 4,It is of special significance to find a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-11,"In early 2020, COVID-19 began generating headlines all over the world because of the extraordinary speed 28 of its transmission. So, there are rising concerns about community infections. Vaccination is one of the 29 most effective tools to prevent infectious diseases [1] [2]. As far as our knowledge concerns, there is no 30 report about developing COVID-19 multi epitope vaccine. Therefore, we became eager to design potent 31 multiepitope vaccines from antigenic sites of coronavirus surface glycoprotein. The multiepitope 32 vaccines have advantageous over conventional vaccines with regards to safety profile and high 33 immunogenicity [3] . Multiepitope vaccines have the potential to induce responses restricted by a 34 wide variety of HLA molecules and generate a balanced CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immune 35 response. Another molecule that contribute to innate immunity contains TLR3 that activates Escherichia coli [7] , Vibrio cholera [8], Human immunodeficiency virus-1 [9], Hepatitis C virus 43 [10] and many others. In several experimental studies, the efficacy of computationally designed 44 vaccines has been recently approved for use in defined human vaccines [11] [13] . In this study, in 45 silico analysis were performed to determine exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus 46 surface glycoprotein that are antigenically most significant for coronavirus. In our research, some 47 unique exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus surface glycoprotein were selected 48 based on their antigenicity, stability and length. The selected epitopes were merged into each other 49 using suitable linkers for organization of final vaccine construct. Consequently, the stability and 50 efficacy of the vaccines were predicted by a set of bioinformatics methods. the conserved sequence and antigenic peptide were selected for further analysis.

A Generalized Discrete Dynamic Model for Human Epidemics,"A discrete dynamic model for human epidemics was developed in present study. The model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period, hospitalization time, non-hospitalization daily mortality, non-hospitalization daily recovery rate, and hospitalization proportion, etc. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated the total cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. The total cumulative cases significantly decreased with transmission strength's decline and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate.","So far a lot of dynamic models have been developed and used in the mechanic analysis and prediction of animal epidemics. Among them the differential equations based models are the mainstream methods, including SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) , Anderson-May model (Anderson and May, 1981) , the models of Zhang et al. (1997 , 2011 ), etc. Zhang et al. (1997 model was a group of differential-integral equations mainly treating susceptible and infected insect populations. The improved model (Zhang et al., 2011) was composed of nearly twenty differential equations supplemented by other equations. In these models, both susceptible and infected populations were treated as population density, and susceptible population interacts with infected population mainly through feeding on virus on the leaves spread by insects that died from virus infection. Serving as both explanatory and simulation models, they have demonstrated the better performance. Both SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) and Anderson-May model (Anderson and May, 1981) include differential equations (correspondingly, difference equations) for susceptible (s) and infected (i) populations rather than population density, and the two populations interact with each other through the interaction term, ps(t)i(t) (Fuxa and Tanada, 1987) . Nevertheless, numerous simulation results showed that both of their models are extremely sensitive to some of the key parameters and initial population sizes, especially the infection coefficient, p. Given true parameters and initial conditions, it was so difficult to synchronously obtain realistic results for population size and key time points (such as the peak time) although both of them are better explanatory models for the epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, the important parameters such as incubation period, hospitalization term, etc., were not included in such explanatory models and most of the other models (Chen et al., 2020a) . In present paper we developed a generalized discrete dynamic model for human epidemics, and sensitivity analysis and scenario prediction was made, aiming to provide a novel simulation tool for future uses."
Live-cell single RNA imaging reveals bursts of translational frameshifting,"Ribosomal frameshifting during the translation of RNA is implicated in both human disease and viral infection. While previous work has uncovered many mechanistic details about single RNA frameshifting kinetics in vitro, very little is known about how single RNA frameshift in living systems. To confront this problem, we have developed technology to quantify live-cell single RNA translation dynamics in frameshifted open reading frames. Applying this technology to RNA encoding the HIV-1 frameshift sequence reveals a small subset (~8%) of the translating pool robustly frameshift in living cells. Frameshifting RNA are preferentially in multi-RNA ""translation factories,"" are translated at about the same All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.","Frameshifting is a fundamental biological process in which a ribosome translating an RNA slips by +/-1 nucleotides, resulting in the translation of an entirely different peptide sequence from that point forward. While frameshifting is generally detrimental to protein fidelity (Belew et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2015) , the process effectively creates two distinct proteins from a single RNA (Clark et al., 2007; Meydan et al., 2017; Yordanova et al., 2015) . Viruses exploit this aspect of frameshifting to minimize their genomes and to successfully replicate in host cells (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Brierley et al., 1989; Caliskan et al., 2015; Cardno et al., 2015; Mouzakis et al., 2013) . A prototypical example is HIV, which utilizes frameshifting to translate the gag-pol proteins from a single viral RNA (Guerrero et al., 2015) ."
Modeling Epidemics: A Primer and Numerus Software Implementation,"Epidemiological models are dominated by SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) dynamical systems formulations and their elaborations. These formulations can be continuous or discrete, deterministic or stochastic, or spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous, the latter often embracing a network formulation. Here we review the continuous and discrete deterministic and discrete stochastic formulations of the SEIR dynamical systems models, and we outline how they can be easily and rapidly constructed using the Numerus Model Builder, a graphicallydriven coding platform. We also demonstrate how to extend these models to a metapopulation setting using both the Numerus Model Builder network and geographical mapping tools.","In a recent comprehensive review of epidemiological models, Smith et al. [1] trace the development of systems of differential equations used over the past 100 years to study disease processes. Once the purview of mathematicians, physicist and engineers, dynamical system formulations of epidemic processes are increasingly being used by epidemiologists, ecologists and social scientists to study the potential for disease pandemics to threaten the lives of humans, domesticated animals and plants, and all organisms across the globe."

Prediction of antiviral drugs against African Swine Fever Viruses based on protein-protein interaction analysis,"The African swine fever virus (ASFV) has severely influenced the swine industry of the world. Unfortunately, there is no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus until now. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of PPIs from multiple sources. Thirty-two swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as AIPs. They were found to play a central role in the swine PPI network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of AIPs also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted AIPs and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on AIPs were identified, such as Polaprezinc. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs. author/funder.

"Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types.","In the past two decades, pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused epidemic infections, including the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV outbreak in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and the current Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak. They typically affect the respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory illnesses. We have learned from SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov that human populations showed disparities in susceptibility to these viruses. For example, epidemiology studies found that males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females. 1, 2 We believe that the susceptibility to the novel 2019-nCov is also different among population groups. In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care."
Congruence of location-specific transcriptional programs in intestinal organoids during long-term culture,"The emergence of intestinal organoids, as a stem cell-based self-renewable model system, has led to many studies on intestinal development and cell-cell signaling. However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of intestinal organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including location specific functions, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most tissue-specific genes were not expressed in the transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.","The intestinal epithelium plays an essential role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients while also maintaining homeostasis with symbiotic microbiota [1] [2] [3] . The physical containment of microbes to the lumen and homeostasis of tolerance and immunity depends on the functions of different lineages of intestinal epithelial cell [2, 3] . For decades, scientists have exploited the replicative potential of immortalized intestinal cells as enterocyte models to study host-pathogen interactions and intestinal functions in vitro. Such monotypic cell models have led to important discoveries but have notable limitations. Immortalized cell lines can undergo significant genotypic alterations within a few passages in vitro which are potential threats to data reproducibility [4] [5] [6] . Furthermore, transformed cell lines often have altered pathway expression compared to primary cells [4] . Since 2009, when it was shown that intestinal adult leucine-rich repeat-containing G proteincoupled receptor 5 (LGR5+) stem cells [7] could be grown into organotypic cultures and propagated in 3D culture [8, 9] , there has been much interest in employing intestinal organoids as advanced models. A distinct advantage of organoids is the development of a crypt-villus axis with a similar spatial organisation of the heterotypic cell lineages found in the tissue of origin. Additionally, methods for generating polarised monolayers of organoids cells [10] have been optimised [11] to improve the versatility of the models, e.g. to study transport, and differential responses to luminal or basolateral stimulants. Another favourable property of organoids generated from adult intestinal stem cells is that they express specific functions associated with their original intestinal location [12] . This means that locationspecific functions of different parts of the intestine are intrinsically programmed in adult stem cells."
Molecular Dynamics Simulations Indicate the COVID-19 Mpro Is Not a Viable Target for Small-Molecule Inhibitors Design,"The novel coronavirus whose outbreak took place in December 2019 continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro). We compared and contrasted the Mpro for COVID-19 with a highly similar SARS protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the pocket's time-dependence indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus' mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors.","In early December 2019, the first atypical pneumonia outbreak associated with the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China 1,2 . As of 23 February 2020, COVID-19 has been reported in 26 countries and nearly 79,000 infection cases (both laboratory-confirmed and reported as clinically diagnosed), including more than 2400 fatal ones, have been confirmed 3 . According to the World Health Organization, a precise estimate of the infection fatality rate is therefore impossible at present. However, the National Health Commission of China, at the press conference on February 4 evaluated that the virus mortality rate stood at 2.1% nationwide (4.9% in Wuhan)."

Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral 44 recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use 45 resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral 46 RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly 47 different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05). Our results 48 demonstrated that the novel polystyrene filter material resulted in the highest concentration of 49 extracted RNA compared to the commonly used polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride, 50 which we speculate may be related to the chemical composition of the filter material (e.g., 51 polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon whereas polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride 52 contain more polar, and thus potentially reactive, carbon-halogen bonds).

TITLE Containing Emerging Epidemics: a Quantitative Comparison of Quarantine and Symptom Monitoring,"Strategies for containing an emerging infectious disease outbreak must be nonpharmaceutical when drugs or vaccines for the pathogen do not yet exist or are unavailable. The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen.","Quarantine and symptom monitoring of contacts with suspected exposure to an infectious disease are key interventions for the control of emerging epidemics; however, there does not yet exist a quantitative framework for comparing the control performance of each."
Title page • Title A combinatorial biomolecular strategy to identify peptides for improved transport across the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and the underlying epithelia • Author names and affiliations,"Drugs and drug delivery systems have to traverse multiple biological barriers to achieve therapeutic efficacy. In diseases of mucosal-associated tissues such as cystic fibrosis (CF), successful delivery of gene and drug therapies remains a significant challenge due to an abnormally concentrated viscoelastic mucus, which prevents ~99% of all drugs and particles from penetrating the mucus barrier and the underlying epithelia for effective therapy, resulting in decreased survival. We used combinatorial peptide-presenting phage libraries and nextgeneration sequencing to identify hydrophilic, close to net-neutral charged peptides that penetrate the mucus barrier ex vivo in sputum from CF patients with ~600-fold better penetration than a positively charged control. After mucus penetration, nanoparticles conjugated with our selected peptides successfully translocated into lung epithelial cells derived from CF patients and demonstrated up to three-fold improved cell uptake compared to non-modified carboxylated-and gold standard PEGylated-nanoparticles. The selected peptides act as surface chemistries with synergistic functions to significantly improve the ability of drug delivery systems to overcome the human mucosal barriers and provide efficient cellular internalization. Our screening strategy provides a biologically-based discovery assay that directly addresses transport through mucus and cell barriers and has the potential to advance drug and gene delivery to multiple mucosal barriers.","For successful treatment of mucosal-associated diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), HIV, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it is critical for drug and gene therapies to cross several biological barriers to enter the target cells at therapeutic concentrations. One of the initial and primary barriers is the protective mucus layer lining the epithelia in the eyes, airways, gastrointestinal and cervicovaginal tracts [1] [2] [3] . Mucus is a complex biopolymer composed mainly of water, mucin glycoproteins, lipids, DNA, non-mucin proteins, salts, and cell debris [4] . The mucus layer acts as a transport barrier and can greatly hinder the diffusion of drugs, particles, and other molecules [5] [6] [7] via size filtering, mucociliary clearance, and intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic, hydrophobic, and/or other specific binding interactions [8] . For example in CF, the hyperconcentrated mucus layer traps foreign pathogens, resulting in chronic bacterial infections and concomitantly prevents up to 99% of drugs and particles from penetration needed for successful therapy [9, 10] . As a result, it is a long-standing challenge for drugs to permeate the mucus barrier and reach the underlying epithelia."
"Title: Epidemiological and clinical features of 291 cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in areas adjacent to Hubei, China: a double-center observational study","Lei, MD have contributed equally to this work.","In December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to other Chinese provinces and 38 countries around the world up to February 26, 2020. Owing to its involvement in multiple areas, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. Up to February 26, 2020, there were 78,630 laboratory-confirmed and clinical-confirmed cases in China and over 3,000 cases outside China while about 2/3 of cases in China was located in Wuhan. 1 Zhang et al reported the largest epidemiological investigation of 72314 cases and showed the crude case fatality rate in Hubei province (2.9%) was 7.3 times higher than other provinces (0.4%) in China, 2 which indicated that there are differences in clinical outcome between the patients in Hubei and other provinces. The features and outcomes of patients with COVID- 19 in Wuhan have been described in detail in several studies. Currently, there has been limited studies about patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang and Beijing, which is far from Hubei. 3, 4 However, the clinical characteristics and progression of disease outside Hubei, especially in areas near Hubei which have a relative higher risk of importing patients than remote areas, were still unknown."
Spatially Explicit Modeling of 2019-nCoV Epidemic Trend Based on Mobile Phone Data in Mainland China,"As of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was","Wuhan, a large city with 14 million residents and a major air and train transportation hub of central China, identified a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 29, 2019 1 . Four patients were initially reported and all these initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market 2 . Chinese health authorities and scientists did immediate investigation and isolated a novel coronavirus from these patients by January 7, 2020, which is then named as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization 3, 4 . 2019-nCoV can cause acute respiratory diseases that progress to severe pneumonia 5 . The infection fatality risk is around 3% estimated from the data of early outbreak 3, 6 . Information on new cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread 1, 7, 8 . Infection of 2019-nCoV quickly spread to other cities in China and other countries ( Figure 1 ). It becomes an event of global health concern 9 . Up to February 11, 2020, according to the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, all prefecturelevel cities of mainland China have confirmed cases and the total number reaches to 42667, of whom 1016 have died and 4242 recovered; 24 oversea countries have 398 confirmed cases (1 died). Chinese government took great effort to control the spread of disease, including closing the public transportation from and to Wuhan on January 23, extending the Spring Festival holiday, postponing the school-back day, and suspending all domestic and international group tours. Unfortunately, many external factors bring a challenge to control virus spreading. First, it might be already late to stop the migration of infected cases. Evidence suggests that Wuhan is the center of 2019-nCoV outbreak 1, 10 . However, around 5 million Wuhan residents left Wuhan in January 2020 due to the Spring Festival (January 24, 2020). It is very likely that a considerable number of infected cases have moved from Wuhan to other cities before Wuhan government implemented border control on January 23. Second, it is highly possible that infected cases spread the virus to their family members or relatives 7 . A study based on 425 patients at the early stage of outbreak revealed that the time from infection to illness onset is 5.2 days 1 . As a result, presymptomatic cases who have left Wuhan may not be isolated themselves from their family and relatives 11 . Third, due to the sudden outbreak of virus, the preparation and resources for preventing virus transmission are limited. The protective equipment in many hospitals in Wuhan was in short supply so that it is difficult to maintain strict personal hygiene. With the quick increase of infected cases, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province have large pressure to isolate and give medical treatment to infected people. All above factors make preventing the spread of 2019-nCoV even more difficult than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus outbreak in China 17 years ago that caused more than 8000 infections and 800 deaths."
Altered polarization of PAR-2 signaling during airway epithelial remodeling,Background: Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) is activated by proteases involved in allergy and triggers airway epithelial secretion and inflammation. PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells.,"Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that can drive inflammation in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and allergic rhinitis. 1, 2 PARs are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular N-terminus, exposing an intramolecular tethered ligand. 1, 2 PAR-2 may be activated by mast cell tryptase, 3 neutrophil elastase, 4 Alternaria fungal proteases, 5 and house dust mite proteases 6 and may promote Th2 inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells. 7 We previously found that PAR-2 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of healthy well-polarized differentiated primary sinonasal epithelial ciliated cells, where it elevates intracellular calcium to increase ciliary beating and apical membrane Clsecreation, 8 suggesting PAR-2 promotes epithelial mucociliary clearance in response to protease activity."
Amplicon based MinION sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic characterisation of nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with COVID-19,COVID-19 is a complex disease phenotype where the underlying microbiome could influence morbidity and mortality. Amplicon and metagenomic MinION based sequencing was used to rapidly (within 8 hours) identify SARS-CoV-2 and assess the microbiome in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients with COVID-19 by the ISARIC 4C consortium.,"Mechanisms of life-threatening disease in COVID-19 including factors associated with morbidity and mortality. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) can provide important parallels: one of the risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome is the presence of other infections [1, 2] . Other infections may therefore exacerbate COVID-19. A case study in China identified the presence of other microorganisms in patients with COVID-19 and included specific nucleic acid based detection for six common respiratory virus and the use of culture [3] . No viruses were identified but the study identified Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aspergillus flavus in a single patient and several cases of fungal infection were diagnosed including Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The ability to rapidly identify both the primary pathogen and other infections that may be present early in disease may provide opportunities for targeted intervention in patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. The advantage of both laboratory [4] and field-based sequencing approaches [5] was illustrated in the West African Ebola virus outbreak in characterising viral infection and also providing an assessment of the contribution of potential co-infections to outcome [6] . Rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 itself provides utility in two main areas. First, specific amplicon-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 allows for potential contact tracing, molecular epidemiology and studies of viral evolution. Second, the use of metagenomic approaches like SISPA provides a check on sequence divergence for amplicon-based approaches. This is particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus could undergo recombination with other human coronaviruses and mutation and this may also affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy."
"Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China. medRxiv","Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China.

Title: Novel tetraplex qPCR assays for simultaneous detection and identification of Xylella fastidiosa subspecies in plant tissues,"Xylella fastidiosa is an insect-borne bacterium confined to the xylem vessels of plants. This plant 15 pathogen has a broad host range estimated to 560 plant species. Five subspecies of the pathogen with 16 different but overlapping host ranges have been described, but only three subspecies are widely 17 accepted, namely subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca. Initially limited to the Americas, Xf has 18 been detected in Europe since 2013.

MERS-CoV spillover at the camel-human interface,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while casebased and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), endemic in camels in the Arabian Peninsula, is the causative agent of zoonotic infections and limited outbreaks in humans. The virus, first discovered in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012; Boheemen et al., 2012) , has caused more than 2000 infections and over 700 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2017) . Its epidemiology remains obscure, largely because infections are observed among the most severely affected individuals, such as older males with comorbidities (Assiri et al., 2013a; The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . While contact with camels is often reported, other patients do not recall contact with any livestock, suggesting an unobserved community contribution to the outbreak (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . Previous studies on MERS-CoV epidemiology have used serology to identify factors associated with MERS-CoV exposure in potential risk groups (Reusken et al., 2015 (Reusken et al., , 2013 . Such data have shown high seroprevalence in camels (Müller et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013 Reusken et al., , 2014 and evidence of contact with MERS-CoV in workers with occupational exposure to camels (Reusken et al., 2015; Müller et al., 2015) .

Host shifts result in parallel genetic changes when viruses evolve in closely related species 1 2,"Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of 17 emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on 18 the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To 19 investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA 20 virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral 21 genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host 22","Host shifts -where a pathogen jumps into and establishes in a new host species -are a major 32 source of emerging infectious diseases. RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [1] [2] [3] [4] , with 33 HIV, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus all having been acquired by humans from other host species 34 [5] [6] [7] . Whilst some pathogens may be pre-adapted to a novel host, there are increasing numbers of 35 examples demonstrating that adaptation to the new host occurs following a host shift [8, 9] . These 36 adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress 37 the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [10, 11] . For example, in the 2013-38 2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early 39 in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and 40 decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [12, 13] . Likewise, a 41 switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the 42 virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [14, 15] "

"Epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia in Beijing, China","Background: SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posing a large casualty. The features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, and laboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results: We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to conversion was 9.71 (95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/µL) of CD8 + T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 and lactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively.

[5] [6] [7] The case number increased quickly in Wuhan and posed a large casualty. Up to February 24, 2020, a total of 46607 confirmed cases had been identified in Wuhan, with an estimated case fatality of 4.26% (1987 deaths). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other parts of Hubei province, other parts of China, and 29 countries, resulting in 17680 cases and 508 deaths (estimated fatality: 2.87%), 12975 cases and 100 deaths (0.77%), and 2105 cases and 24 deaths (1.14%), respectively (up to February 24, 2020). The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is higher and the fatality is lower compared to SARS-CoV, although the two CoVs share the receptor-human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2).

Prediction of criticality in patients with severe Covid-19 infection using three clinical features: a machine learning-based prognostic model with clinical data in Wuhan,"We screened the electronic records of 2,799 patients admitted in Tongji Hospital from January 10th to February 18th, 2020. There were 375 discharged patients including 201 survivors. We built a prognostic prediction model based on XGBoost machine learning algorithm and then tested 29 patients (included 3 patients from other hospital) who were cleared after February 19th.","The outbreaks of COVID-19 epidemic has caused worldwide health concerns since December, 2019. It has been shown in literature [ patients is astonishingly 61.5%. However, it is arduous to identify these patients manually from the infectious crowds.

"Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation","2019-nCov has caused more than 80 deaths as of 27 January 2020 in China, and infection cases have been reported in more than 10 countries. However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov M pro is a potential drug target to combat the virus. We built homology models based on SARS M pro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known M pro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov M pro .","In December 2019, cluster of patients with pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1, 2 Shortly, a new coronavirus, temporally named 2019-nCov, was identified to be the cause of the disease, which is the seventh member of the family betacoronavirus. 1 More than 2,700 infection cases and 80 deaths were reported as of 27"
Comparison of alternative models of human movement and the spread of disease,"Predictive models for the spatial spread of infectious diseases has received much attention in recent years as tools for the management of infectious diseas outbreaks. Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer's rank model, Fotheringham's competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer's rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets.","Accurately predicting the geographical spread of emerging, re-emerging, and recurrent 14 epidemics in an increasingly globalized world is a matter of international urgency in the 15 wake of outbreaks of emerging pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 16 (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and ebola virus disease (EBVD) as 17 well as re-emerging and resurgent pathogens such as influenza subtype A-H1N1, 18 whooping cough, and measles. In response to this challenge, various 'spatial interaction' 19 models describing human movement as a function of population distribution have been 20 proposed. Some of these borrow from economics and human geography while others 21 adapt models from movement ecology and the physics of reaction and diffusion on 22 heterogenous landscapes. 23 In recent years, the field has seen the widespread adoption of a family of so-called 24 'gravity' models from transportation theory and human geography (see, e.g., [1, 2] ). In 25 its most common form, the gravity model posits that the migration flux between a pair 26 of cities is log-linearly dependent on their respective sizes and on their separating 27 distance. The application of this simple model to disease spread was originally proposed 28 by Murray and Cliff [3] , but over the last decade, many studies have used it to explain 29 historical, or predict future, disease spread in a range of infections including measles [4] , 30 influenza [5] [6] [7] , cholera [8] , and yellow fever [9] . While its application has yielded 31 insights, the geography literature has highlighted a prominent shortcoming of the 32 gravity model. In particular, these models ignore the potential for competitive or 33 synergistic interactions among population centers ( Fig. 1 ; [10, 11] ). Thus, for example, 34 movement between Boston and Washington DC is assumed to be unaffected by the 35 presence of the intervening city of New York. 36 As it happens, there are distinct families of models, arising from economics and 37 geography, that predict human movement patterns while allowing for higher-order 38 interactions among cities. In particular, Stouffer's [12] 'law of intervening opportunities' 39 posits that ""the number of persons going a given distance is directly proportional to the 40 number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of 41 intervening opportunities"". This idea has given rise to alternative models for human can feed back onto migration. Most obviously, disease symptoms can influence 53 movement behavior, as seen, for example, in the fact that a mild cold may induce 54 minimal changes in movement behavior but severe hemorrhagic fever or acute paralytic 55 disease will typically slow the movement of the infected hosts. These two considerations 56 do not preclude the utility of spatial interaction models in the infectious disease context; 57 they do, however, complicate their use and the importance of understanding 58 transmission relevant migration fluxes, which will be some sort of 'effective average' of 59 movement as filtered through such aforementioned complications."
Modeling and Prediction of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Spreading in China Incorporating Human Migration Data,"This study integrates the daily intercity migration data with the classic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model to construct a new model suitable for describing the dynamics of epidemic spreading of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China. Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China are collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Historical data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source are used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimization procedure is used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the coming weeks. Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (known earlier as New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia) began to spread since December 2019 from Wuhan, which has been widely regarded as the epicenter of the epidemic, to almost all provinces throughout China and 28 other countries. Human-to-human transmission had been found to occur in some early Wuhan cases in mid December [1] , and the high volume and frequency of movement of people from Wuhan to other cities and between cities is thus an obvious cause for the wide and rapid spread of the disease throughout the country. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model has traditionally been used to study epidemic spreading with various forms of networks of transmission which define the contact topology [2] , such as scalefree networks [3, 4, 5] , small-world networks [6, 7] , Oregon graph [8, 9] , and adaptive networks [10] . Moreover, in most studies, the contact process assumes that the contagion expands at a certain rate from an infected individual to his/her neighbor, and that the spreading process takes place in a single population (network). The COVID-19 outbreak, however, began to occur and escalate in a special holiday period in China (about 20 days surrounding the Lunar New Year), during which a huge volume of intercity travel took place, resulting in outbreaks in multiple regions connected by an active transportation network. Thus, in order to understand the COVID-19 spreading process in China, it is essential to examine the human migration dynamics, especially between the epicenter Wuhan and other Chinese cities. A recent study has also revealed the risk of transmission of the virus from Wuhan to other cities [11] ."
Modulation of metabolic functions through Cas13d-mediated gene knockdown in liver,"RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels.

In the past decades, many strategies of metabolic regulations were achieved through using various modulators, including numerous small molecular compounds, nucleic acids, and therapeutic polypeptides/proteins targeting individual or multiple defined molecular products, such as enzymes, circulating proteins, cell-surface receptors and cellular RNAs (Moller, 2012) . Applications of metabolic modulation have great potential for disease modeling and therapies. However, developing novel approaches with more specific and more flexible modulation of metabolic genes in vivo is still challenging, because natural and synthesized modulators with high targeting specificity are theoretically limited."

Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19): An Updated Systematic Review,Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.,"COVID-19 among different studies, partly due to anthropogenic differences in patients enrolled and differences in sample size across different studies. Notably, variation in reporting descriptive data may lead to the misunderstanding of COVID-9 characteristics. In this updated systematic review, hence, we sought to address the heterogeneities among published retrospective studies and to synthesize the available data. We expect this critical review will provide insights to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a more systematic manner."

Clearing the FoG: Antifungal tolerance is a subpopulation effect that is distinct from 3 resistance and is associated with persistent candidemia 4 5,"Drug susceptibility, defined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), often does not 25 predict whether fungal infections will respond to therapy in the clinic. Tolerance at supra-MIC 26 antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest 27 it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could 28 influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of 29 Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified 30 antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly 31 distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow 32 growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the 33 population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, 34 many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance 35 without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as 36 Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant 37 combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly 38 tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels.","( Supplementary Fig. 3e) .

Consistent with this, in liquid assays with drug, highly tolerant 187 isolates also displayed shorter lag times than related isolates with low tolerance levels 188 ( Supplementary Fig. 5a )."
Alterations in sialic-acid O-acetylation glycoforms during murine erythrocyte development,"in host-pathogen interactions. CASD1 has been described as a sialate-Oacetyltransferase and has been shown to be essential for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in some cell lines in vitro. In this study, we used knockout mice to confirm that CASD1 is indeed responsible for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in vivo. We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4 + T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis.","Sialic acid, a monosaccharide with a nine-carbon backbone, is widely found in nature as a terminal sugar of animal and microbial glycoproteins and glycolipids. It plays important roles in animal development, cellular recognition processes and host-pathogen interactions (Schauer, 2009) . A common modification of sialic acid is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition and ganglioside biology. The hemagglutinins or hemagglutinin-esterases of type C influenza viruses and certain nidoviruses specifically recognize the 9-O-acetylated form of sialic acid, and this form of sialic acid is required for the entry of these viruses into human cells. Although we had previously inferred a role for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in regulating Siglec-2 (Cariappa et al., 2009) , we have demonstrated that many of the phenotypes on the basis of which earlier conclusions were made, actually resulted from a mutation that was traceable to a commercially available C57BL/6 strain of mice (Mahajan et al., 2016) . , 2015) . Their studies implicated CASD1 in directly transferring acetyl moieties from acetyl-CoA to CMP-sialic acid. Whether CMP-sialic acid is the preferred substrate for the O-acetylation of sialic acid in vivo however remains to be established. In this report, we describe a mouse strain in which Casd1 has been deleted in the germline. Analysis of these mice demonstrated the loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid on the surface of all hematopoietic cells examined. Based on the differential specificity of hemagglutinin O-acetylated sialic acid found on the surface of murine myeloid cells may decorate this glycoprotein. Indeed, mucin-like glycoproteins such as CD43 and CD45RB have been shown to bear 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on mononuclear cells in the spleen (Krishna and Varki, 1997) . No detectable 9-O-acetyl sialic acid was found on the CD11b + CD43 + population in the bone marrows of Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1C) . A large proportion of CD43 + CD11bnon-myeloid cells, largely hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow, also express surface 9-O-acetyl sialic acid in wild type mice but this was completely lost in Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1C) ."
TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex and biases towards MyD88-dependent 1 signaling in environmental lung injury 2,"Lung disease causes significant morbidity and mortality, and is exacerbated by environmental 24 injury, e.g. through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or ozone (O3). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate 25 immune responses to injury by recognizing pathogen-or danger-associated molecular patterns. 26 TLR4, the prototypic receptor for LPS, also mediates inflammation after O3, triggered by 27 endogenous hyaluronan. Regulation of TLR4 signaling is incompletely understood. TLR5, the 28 flagellin receptor, is expressed in alveolar macrophages, and regulates immune responses to 29 environmental injury. Using in vivo animal models of TLR4-mediated inflammations (LPS, O3, 30 hyaluronan), we show that TLR5 impacts the in vivo response to LPS, hyaluronan and O3. We 31 demonstrate that immune cells of human carriers of a dominant negative TLR5 allele have 32 decreased inflammatory response to O3 exposure ex vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Using 33 primary murine macrophages, we find that TLR5 physically associates with TLR4 and biases 34 TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway. Our results suggest an updated paradigm for 35 TLR4/TLR5 signaling. 36","Lung disease is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the US alone, over 44 15% of the population suffers from lung disease, at an annual cost of 120,000 deaths, and >$50 45 billion (1-3). Environmental lung injury, e.g. through inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or elevated 46 ozone (O3) levels, exacerbates lung disease (4-7). For example, household LPS levels are directly 47 associated with asthma symptoms and asthma-related health care utilization (7). Also, sound 48 epidemiological studies suggest that for every 10 parts-per-billion (ppb) increase in O3 levels there 49 is an associated mortality increase of 0.39-0. 87% (5, 8) . It is therefore imperative to understand 50 the mechanisms of environmentally induced lung injury. 51"
Inhibition of arterivirus RNA synthesis by cyclophilin inhibitors is 3 counteracted by mutations in replicase transmembrane subunits 4 5,"Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to 26 inhibit the replication of diverse RNA viruses, including arteriviruses and coronaviruses, which both 27 belong to the order Nidovirales. Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-28 of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA 29 synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus 30 (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence 31 of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the 32 arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or 33 A134V) led to a ~2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations 34 further increased EAV's CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered 35 EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. 36","However, other coronaviruses seem to be much less affected by depletion of CypA in the infected cell 110 (de Wilde et Our present study aimed to investigate the molecular details of the inhibition of arterivirus 114 replication by cyclophilin inhibitors.

Role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases,"COVID-19 is having a great impact on public health, mortality and economy worldwide, in spite of the efforts to prevent its epidemy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak.","The outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China during last December led to great efforts to prevent a global epidemic. The alert from China CDC was rapidly transmitted to the World Health Organization, 1-3 excluding possible causes such as influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). 1, [3] [4] The novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, and its genomic characterization was performed a few days after, permitting to devise a robust test method.

When human-to-human transmission was proved, on the 20th of January, the onset of the disease (COVID-19) has changed. 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] According to the China CDC 11 , the case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.2% at the end of January 2020 and 14.4% of the confirmed cases were considered severe or even critical. In the last week of February, 79441 cases were confirmed worldwide (97% in Mainland China) and the number of deaths was 2620 (95% in Mainland China). 12, 13 The epidemiological curves of COVID-19 in China showed the progression of illness in the outbreak over time from December 8, 2019 up to February 11, 2020, 11 when there were a total of 72314 confirmed cases as the geo-temporal spread of COVID- 19. 11 At that time, the majority of confirmed cases occurred in the northern hemisphere and until the last week of February 2020 no confirmed cases had been reported in South America or Africa, except for one .

DeepTracer: Predicting Backbone Atomic Structure from High Resolution Cryo-EM Den- sity Maps of Protein Complexes XXXXXXX Received on XXXXX; revised on XXXXX; accepted on XXXXX,"Motivation: Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results: We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. Availability: The repository of this project will be published.","Proteins represent an essential building block in all organisms. They perform crucial functions such as DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and many more [1] . Each protein consists of a sequence of the same 20 kinds of amino acids, while all amino acids are made up of a carbon, carbonalpha (Cα), and nitrogen atom, as well as a side chain which determines the amino acid type and is connected to the Cα atom. The functionality of a protein is determined through its structure, defined by the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of the amino acids that make up the protein [2] ."
Structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors,"Recent history is punctuated by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-and MERS-CoV into human circulation. Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 Å resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.","Coronaviruses (CoV) represent a diverse family of positive-sense RNA viruses capable of causing respiratory and enteric disease in human and animal hosts. Though there are several human coronaviruses responsible for a mild respiratory disease 1 , most notable are the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV capable of causing a severe respiratory disease. The zoonotic SARS-CoV emerged into human populations in 2002, spreading to 26 countries during its brief nine month circulation in humans 2 . This epidemic resulted in over 8,000 infections with a ~10% case fatality rate and was eventually contained through public health measures, as there are no specific treatments approved for human coronavirus infections. With the exception of a smaller second SARS-CoV outbreak in 2004 3 , SARS-CoV has been absent from human circulation since the initial outbreak ended. Despite the lack of recent human infections, SARS-CoVlike viruses continue to circulate in bat reservoirs 4 . Similar to SARS-CoV, the zoonotic MERS-CoV also causes a severe respiratory infection in humans and has so far shown limited human-to-human transmission outside of hospital settings 5 . However, ongoing zoonotic transmissions of MERS-CoV have continued since 2012 5 . Outbreaks of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses remain an emerging threat to global health security and given past history are likely to continue to occur."
Estimating the generation interval for COVID-19 based on symptom onset data,Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies.,"In order to plan intervention strategies aimed at bringing disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 outbreak under control as well as to monitor disease outbreaks, public health officials depend on insights about key disease transmission parameters which are typically obtained from mathematical or statistical modelling. Examples of key parameters include the reproduction number (average number of infections caused by an infectious individual) and distributions of the generation interval (time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair), serial interval (time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair), and incubation period (time between moment of infection and symptom onset) [1] . Estimates of the reproduction number together with the generation interval distribution can provide insight into the speed with which a disease will spread."
X-ray Structure of Main Protease of the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Enables Design of a-Ketoamide Inhibitors,"A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of a massive outbreak of atypical pneumonia originating at Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Involved in the formation of the coronavirus replication complex, the viral main protease (M pro , also called 3CL pro ) represents an attractive target for therapy. We determined the crystal structure of the unliganded M pro at 1.75 Å resolution and used this structure to guide optimization of a series of alpha-ketoamide inhibitors.","Since December 2019, a new coronavirus has been emerging in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. Whereas at the beginning of the outbreak, cases were connected to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan, efficient human-to-human transmission led to exponential growth in the number of cases, with the count standing at >71,000 as of today, with a ~2.4% case-fatality rate. The RNA genome of 2019-nCoV features an identity of about 82% to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); both viruses belong to clade b of the genus Betacoronavirus."
Gut microbiota structure differs between honey,"Adult honey bees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While 25 seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have 26 focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. 27 Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer 28 than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We 29 quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over two years 30 and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter.","an important characteristic of different bee types (e.g. foragers, nurses, winter bees), 87 season, or environmental exposure. An example is the experimental exposure of bees to 88 antibiotics which did not result in a strong shift in the relative composition, but in an overall 89 reduction of bacterial load, rendering bees more susceptible to pathogen invasion [11] . In 90 addition to the limitations of current studies using relative abundance data, almost nothing 91 is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees as compared to foragers or nurses. This 92 is surprising, as winter bees are critical for colony health and survival during the cold season 93 of the year, when resources are limited and most colony losses occur [33, 34] . 94 Characterizing the gut microbiota of winter bees and identifying factors that shape its 95 community composition may help to understand the physiological adaptations that honey 96 bees need to survive the cold season in temperate regions. In this study, we used qPCR and 97 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the gut microbiota of nurses, 98 foragers, and winter bees. We analyzed bacterial loads of major community members in 99 566 individual worker bees sampled from a single hive over two years. We then expanded 100 our analysis to the entire community and analyzed pooled samples from 14 different hives 101 to test if similar community changes occur in winter bees across hives. Finally, we 102 performed experiments with gnotobiotic bees to test the influence of diet on differences 103 in gut microbiota composition. Our study reveals major differences in total bacterial load 104 and in the abundance of specific gut community members in the gut microbiota of nurses, 105 foragers, and winter bees and identifies dietary pollen as a major contributing factor.

"Genotypic diversity, circulation patterns, and co-detections among rhinoviruses in Queensland, 2001","Rhinoviruses (RVs) occur more frequently than other viruses and more often in people displaying symptoms than in those without. RVs exacerbate chronic airway disease and confound the clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness. We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to breakdown RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections by comprehensive molecular testing of a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001.","Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the largest related assemblage of genetically and antigenically distinct respiratory pathogens known, comprising 168 genotypes. These picornavirus species often occur in symptomatic young children from community and hospital populations where they create a sizable burden for management and are a frequent trigger of wheeze. [1] [2] [3] Picornavirus infections can more often be observed among children presenting to an emergency department than other respiratory virus infections. 4 Nearly three quarters of respiratory virus detection episodes during the first 28 days of life are due to RVs and over half are symptomatic. 3 Until recently, much of what is known of RV diversity, epidemiology and clinical impact was determined using human studies and cell culture methods in the 1950s to 1980s. In 2006, the molecular discovery of a genetic clade of RVs that could only be cultured in vitro using sophisticated air-liquid interface cultures was subsequently ratified as a third species, Rhinovirus C (RV-C). 5, 6 To date, RV-C has added 56 distinct RV types to the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. As more is learned, conclusions reached by some earlier studies have required re-examination and confirmation.

Animal virus ecology and evolution are shaped by the virus host-body,"12 The current classification of animal viruses primarily relates to the virus molecular world, the 13 genomic architecture and the corresponding host-cell infection cycle. This virus centered 14 perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus 15 transmission success.

Here we present the 'AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm' ('AVARDA'), a multi-module software package for analyzing VirScan datasets. AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection at species-level resolution by considering alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected antibody responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thereby improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 62.5%. We further assessed AVARDA's utility in the setting of an epidemiological study, demonstrating its ability to determine infections acquired in a child followed prospectively from infancy. We consider ways in which AVARDA's conceptual framework may be further developed in the future and describe how its analyses may be extended beyond investigations of viral infection. AVARDA, in combination with VirScan and other pan-pathogen serological techniques, is likely to find broad utility in the epidemiology and diagnosis of infectious diseases.","Comprehensive profiling of virome-wide antibody binding specificities has broad utility for epidemiological investigations, surveillance of emerging viruses, and the unbiased diagnosis of infections 1, 2, 3, 4 . Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (""PhIP-seq"") 5 with a peptide library spanning the human virome (""VirScan"") 6 provides a platform for unbiased, high-throughput, low cost analysis of anti-viral antibodies. While other multiplexed serological techniques exist 7 , each is limited in its representation of viral antigens 8 , the size and quality of the epitopes presented 9 , the per-sample assay cost and/or sample throughput. VirScan provides favorable performance characteristics, but until now interpretation of assay results has been limited by a rudimentary analytical framework."
COVID-19 in Japan: What could happen in the future?,"medRxiv preprint COVID-19 has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly Since December 2019. We have independently developed a novel statistical time delay dynamic model on the basis of the distribution models from CCDC.

The RNA pseudoknots in foot-and-mouth disease virus are dispensable for genome replication but essential for the production of infectious virus. 2 3,"word count: 194 22 Text word count: 5168 23 24 25 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38","VP3, and VP0 (which is further processed to VP2 and VP4 during virus assembly) (6).

SPINT2 inhibits proteases involved in activation of both influenza viruses and metapneumoviruses 1 2,"Viruses possessing class I fusion proteins require proteolytic activation by host cell proteases to mediate 18 fusion with the host cell membrane. The mammalian SPINT2 gene encodes a protease inhibitor that 19 targets trypsin-like serine proteases. Here we show the protease inhibitor, SPINT2, restricts cleavage-20 activation efficiently for a range of influenza viruses and for human metapneumovirus (HMPV). SPINT2 21 treatment resulted in the cleavage and fusion inhibition of full-length influenza A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) HA, 22","Influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) represent a significant burden on public health and can be caused by 10 a range of respiratory viruses in addition to influenza virus itself (1). An ongoing goal of anti-viral drug 11 discovery is to develop broadly-acting therapeutics that can be used in the absence of definitive diagnosis, 12 such as in the case of ILIs. For such strategies to succeed, drug targets that are shared across virus families 13 need to be identified. 14 For the SPINT2 inhibition assays, trypsin (which typically resides in the intestinal tract and expresses a very 1 broad activity towards different HA subtypes and HMPV F) served as a control (41). In addition, furin was 2 used as a negative control that is not inhibited by SPINT2. As none of the peptides used in combination 3 with the aforementioned proteases has a furin cleavage site we tested furin-mediated cleavage on a 4 peptide with a H5N1 HPAI cleavage motif in the presence of 500 nM SPINT2 (Supplementary Figure 1) . 5"
Title 4 Spike-based phylogenetically defined clades within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species 5 6 Authors 7,"Taxonomic classification for the Coronaviridae can be challenging, due to the wide host tropism 30 and highly variable genome of the viruses in this Family. Within the Alphacoronavirus genus, there is a 31 single species Alphacoronavirus 1 that encompasses several biologically distinct viruses of distinct animal 32 species. Here, we carried out phylogenetic analysis of members of the Alphacoronavirus genus, focusing 33 on the viral spike gene, which is a primary driver of viral tropism and pathogenesis. We identify two 34 distinct clades (A and B) within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species. Alphacoronavirus 1 clade A 35 encompasses serotype I FCoV and CCoV, and Alphacoronavirus 1 clade B, encompasses serotype II 36","The Alphacoronavirus genus is composed of viruses infecting bats, ferrets, mink, cats, dogs, pigs, 71 and humans. The prototypical species Alphacoronavirus 1 is composed of the following prototypical virus 72 strains (6): feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and transmissible gastrointestinal 73 enteric virus (TGEV). FCoV is an Alphacoronavirus of particular interest as it manifests as two distinct 74 biotypes or pathotypes with a highly transmissible form, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that provokes 75 self-limiting, usually mild enteric tract infections, and a systemic form, feline infectious peritonitis virus 76 (FIPV), typically associated with low transmissibility but high morbidity (7). In the widely accepted ""internal 77 mutation"" hypothesis, it is believed that genetic mutations in the genome of FCoV occur within an infected 78 animal, giving rise to FIPV (8). A similar FIP-like pathogenesis phenomenon is also observed with ferret 79 coronaviruses (FRCoV) (9). While CCoV is a widespread enteric virus of dogs and can occur in highly 80 pathogenic forms, the virus does not manifest itself with FIP-like clinical signs (10). 81"
Transmission Dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia,"This paper focuses on the formulation of a deterministic 2019-nCov transmission model by considering the exposed and recovered populations with immunity. The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.","On 31 December 2019, China notified an outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City to the World Health Organization (WHO) and it had been identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In January 2020, several cases were confirmed outside the Mainland of China and hence WHO has declared 2019-nCoV as a global health emergency. Approximately one month since the notification to the WHO, there were 24,663 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases worldwide where 29 countries were affected. January 25 in Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the first three confirmed cases of whom are of China nationality. The three infected patients were reported to have entered Malaysia from Singapore of which two days earlier, a confirmed case was notified by the Singapore authorities. The first infected Malaysian was reported on February 4. Based on the patient mobility report prior to the notification, it was noted that he was in Singapore for a week starting on January 16, 2020 to attend an international conference where some of the conference delegates were reported to have come from China. It was noted that this patient's symptoms appear on 23 January and he only seek for treatment on January 29 and was referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital on February 2."
Estimating the Relative Probability of Direct Transmission between Infectious Disease Patients,"Estimating infectious disease parameters such as the serial interval (time between symptom onset in primary and secondary cases) and reproductive number (average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case) are important to understand infectious disease dynamics. Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases.","Infectious disease parameters such as the serial interval (time between symptom onset from primary to secondary case) and the reproductive number (average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case over the infection course) are instrumental in managing outbreaks (1) . For diseases in which disease progression shortly follows infection, these parameters have been studied extensively (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . For others, such as tuberculosis (TB), the serial interval and reproductive number estimates are few and inconsistent (7) (8) (9) ."

A novel totivirus alters gene expression and vacuolar morphology in Malassezia cells and induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response Running Head: A novel totivirus in Malassezia,"Most fungal viruses have been identified in plant pathogens, whereas the presence of viral 33 particles in human pathogenic fungi is less well studied. In the present study, we observed 34 extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in various clinical isolates of 35 Malassezia species. Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface, 36 and species in this group are considered to be etiological factors in various skin diseases 37 including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We identified novel dsRNA 38 segments and our sequencing results revealed that the virus, named MrV40, belongs to the 39 Totiviridae family and contains an additional satellite dsRNA segment encoding a novel 40 protein. The transcriptome of virus-infected M. restricta cells was compared to that of virus-41 free cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were 42 down regulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were 43 increased in abundance. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly 44 larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection 45 dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that a viral nucleic 46 acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-47 derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and this result suggests that a viral element contributes to 48 the pathogenesis of Malassezia. Importance 51 Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface and is associated 52 with various skin diseases including dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Among Malassezia 53 species, M. restricta is the most widely observed species on the human skin. In the current 54 study, we identified a novel dsRNA virus, named MrV40, in M. restricta and characterized 55 the sequences and structure of the viral genome along with an independent satellite dsRNA 56 viral segment. Moreover, we found altered expression of genes involved in ribosomal 57 synthesis and programmed cell death, indicating that virus infection altered the physiology of 58 the fungal host cells. Our data also showed that the viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induces a 59 TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells 60 (BMDCs), indicating that a viral element likely contributes to the pathogenesis of Malassezia. 61 This is the first study to identify and characterize a novel mycovirus in Malassezia. : bioRxiv preprint 65 mushrooms (1). Fungal viruses, also known as mycoviruses, possess different forms of viral 66 genomes including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and 67 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It is estimated that 30-80% of all fungal species, mainly 68 endophytic fungi, are infected with viruses. Unlike viruses that infect other organisms, the 69 transmission of fungal virus occurs vertically by cell division or horizontally via mating or 70 hyphal anastomosis, with no extracellular phase of the virus life cycle. dsRNA segments have 71 predominantly been found for fungal viruses and, taxonomically, the fungal dsRNA viruses 72 are classified into seven families: Chrysoviridae, Endornaviridae, Megabirnaviridae, 73 Quadriviridae, Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, and Totiviridae (2). 74 The model fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae also carries a dsRNA virus that belongs to the 75 Totiviridae family and is known as the L-A virus. A unique feature of fungal viruses of the 76 Totiviridae family is their capability to produce the killer toxin that lyses susceptible neighbor 77 strains, whereas the virus-containing strain (also known as a killer strain) is immune to the 78 toxin. Studies of how the virus produces killer toxins in S. cerevisiae showed that killer toxins 79 are encoded by a satellite dsRNA segment, known as the M satellite, within the L-A virus. To 80 date, four different killer toxins, K1, K2, K28, and Klus have been described (3-6). The S. 81 cerevisiae L-A virus forms icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 39 nm (7).","Viruses have been observed in many fungal species since their first identification in diameter of 43 nm (Fig. 2C) . These results support the hypothesis that the extrachromosomal 156 dsRNA segments formed the genome of mycovirus in M. restricta KCTC27540. We named motifs, which are commonly found in totiviruses, were found within ORF2, supporting the (Table 1 and Table S1 ). These results indicate that the presence of the virus may 240 impact a number of physiological processes in M. restricta."
G-quadruplex stabilization in the ions and maltose transporters inhibit Salmonella enterica growth and virulence,"The G-quadruplex structure forming motifs have recently emerged as a novel therapeutic drug target in various human pathogens. Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ -1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg 2+ and Fe 3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection.","Salmonella enterica belongs to Enterobacteriaceae family and known to cause typhoid fever and food poisoning in the human. Salmonella enterica consists of six subspecies namely 1) enterica 2) salamae 3) arizonae 4) diarizonae 5) houtenae 6) indica (Fig 1a) . Among these subspecies, subspecies S. enterica is known to infect human and possess ~2463 serovars that can be further divided into two subclasses [1, 2] ."
A comprehensive annotation and differential expression analysis of short and long non-coding RNAs in 16 bat genomes,"Although bats are increasingly becoming the focus of scientific studies due to their unique properties, these exceptional animals are still among the least studied mammals. Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (Electronic Supplement) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology, and important host-virus interactions.","Bats (Chiroptera) are the most abundant, ecologically diverse and globally distributed animals within all vertebrates 1 , but representative genome arrangements and corresponding coding and non-coding gene annotations are still incomplete 2 . Except for the extreme polar regions, bats can be found throughout the globe, feeding on diverse sources such as insects, blood, nectar, fruits, and pollen 2 . Their origin has been dated in the Cretaceous period, with a diversification explosion process dating back to the Eocene 3 ."
Profiling ACE2 expression in colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients by single-cell transcriptome analysis,"A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets.","As one member of the family coronaviride, coronavirus are enveloped with non-segmented positive sense RNA, which are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals(1).

Global dynamics of a general vector-borne disease model with two,"1 transmission routes 2 Sk Shahid Nadim a , Indrajit Ghosh 1a , Joydev Chattopadhyay a 3 Abstract 5","The mode of transmission of some infectious diseases may be through both direct and indirect con-9 tact. In direct transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through infected host, and in 10 indirect transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through an infected vector.

Additionally, the influenza pandemic of 2009 has triggered a psychological effect that caused adoption of preventive 23 measures by a significant portion of the population (4). Recent MERS-CoV outbreak in Arabian penin-24 sula also imposed a significant behaviour change in the local people (1) . Thus, psychological effects 25 are necessary in modelling infectious disease transmission. The general incidence rate in this context at time t is given by N v (t) = S v (t) + I v (t).

Quantifying transmission of emerging zoonoses: 3 Using mathematical models to maximize the value of surveillance data 4 5 6 7,"Understanding and quantifying the transmission of zoonotic pathogens is essential for 24 directing public health responses, especially for pathogens capable of transmission between 25 humans. However, determining a pathogen's transmission dynamics is complicated by 26 challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of 27 transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of 28 surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these 29 challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. 30","Introduction 54 Many recent infectious disease threats have been caused by pathogens with zoonotic 55 origins, including Ebola, pandemic H1N1 influenza, and SARS-and MERS-Coronaviruses, and 56 zoonotic pathogens are expected to be a primary source of future emerging infectious diseases 57 control measure, implemented at a known point in time, causes an abrupt reduction in spillover. 135 A related approach that requires knowledge of the human and animal reservoir population sizes 136 was also explored in Lo Iacono et al. [35] . Crucially, however, none of these methods 137 incorporate information about the spatial location of cases to improve inference power or to 138 estimate patterns of spatial spread. Spatial data is a powerful tool in transmission inference in 139 single-species studies (e.g. [36] [37] [38] [39] ), but has largely been excluded from analyses of zoonotic 140 transmission, which often implicitly assume homogenous mixing across the study area or that 141 human-to-human transmission can only occur within a locality. One recent exception to this is 142 the analysis by Cauchemez et al. [40] , which includes transmission at several spatial levels. 143"

International travelers and genomics uncover a 'hidden' Zika outbreak,"The ongoing Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged public health surveillance, response, and control systems. Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by longlived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be 'silently' spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.","The recent Zika epidemic in the Americas is a testament to how rapidly mosquito-borne viruses can emerge and spread, and has revealed flaws in our surveillance and response systems (Grubaugh et al., 2018a; Morens and Fauci, 2017) . Due, in part, to high rates of subclinical infections and overlapping symptoms with infections from dengue and chikungunya viruses (Mitchell et al., 2018) , Zika virus was circulating for more than a year and a half before it was first detected in Brazil (Faria et al., 2017) . By the time Zika virus was discovered in May of 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) and recognized for its ability to cause severe congenital disease (França et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) , the virus had already spread from Brazil to more than 40 countries (Faria et al., 2017; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017; Thézé et al., 2018) . By mid 2017, reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, 2017a) revealed Zika virus activity throughout the Americas was waning, prompting predictions for the end of the epidemic (e.g. (O'Reilly et al., 2018) ) and the removal of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" status (WHO, 2016a (WHO, , 2016b ."
Precautions are Needed for COVID-19 Patients with Coinfection of Common Respiratory Pathogens,"With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 , infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics.

Here, we present data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 52 patients from the current outbreak, obtained from publicly available line lists [11] . We fit 53 an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited 54 numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution 55 characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the 56 community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location 57 is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We 58 estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV 59 is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of The distribution of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation was estimated using 69 patient data from the ongoing outbreak [11] (data are shown in Fig 1A) .

A single locus underlies variation in Caenorhabditis elegans chemotherapeutic responses,"Pleiotropy, the concept that a single gene controls multiple distinct traits, is prevalent in most organisms and has broad implications for medicine and agriculture. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1 . Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1 , which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes. : bioRxiv preprint / Here, we use linkage mapping to identify a single overlapping QTL on chromosome V that influences the responses to eight chemotherapeutic compounds. We show that these drug-response QTL also overlap with an expression QTL hotspot that contains the gene scb-1 , previously implicated in bleomycin response (Brady et al. 2019) . Although the exact mechanism of scb-1 is yet unknown, it is hypothesized to act in response to stress (Riedel et al. 2013 ) and has weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Zhang et al. 2018; Kelley et al. 2015) . Together, these data suggest that the importance of scb-1 expression might extend beyond bleomycin response. We validated the QTL using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and performed mediation analysis to predict that scb-1 expression explains the observed QTL for five of the eight drugs. Finally, we directly tested the effect of scb-1 loss of function on chemotherapeutic responses. We discovered that expression of scb-1 underlies differential responses to several chemotherapeutics that cause double-strand DNA breaks, not just bleomycin. This discovery of pleiotropy helps to further define the role of scb-1 by expanding its known functions and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the nematode drug response.","Pleiotropy refers to the well established notion that a single gene or genetic variant affects multiple distinct traits (Paaby and Rockman 2013) , and the discovery of pleiotropic genes can provide meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of these traits (Tyler, Crawford, and Pendergrass 2016) . It has become easier to identify pleiotropic genes with the advent of reverse-genetic screens and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (Paaby and Rockman 2013) . For example, pleiotropic QTL for diverse growth and fitness traits have been identified in organisms such as yeast (Peltier et al. 2019; Jerison et al. 2017; Cubillos et al. 2011) , Arabidopsis (Fusari et al. 2017; McKay, Richards, and Mitchell-Olds 2003; El-Assal et al. 2004) , Drosophila (McGuigan et al. 2014; Brown et al. 2013) , and mice (White et al. 2013; Leamy et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014 ) . These studies have led to important questions in the field of evolutionary genetics regarding the 'cost of complexity' (Fisher, n.d.; Orr 2000) , as a single mutation might be beneficial for one trait and harmful for another (Wagner and Zhang 2011) . Furthermore, human association studies have identified pleiotropic variants associated with different diseases (Sivakumaran et al. 2011; Chesmore, Bartlett, and Williams 2018; Pavlides et al. 2016) , highlighting both the ubiquity and importance of certain immune-related genes and oncogenes across unrelated diseases (Gratten and Visscher 2016; Borrello, Degl'Innocenti, and Pierotti 2008) . Perhaps the strongest evidence of pleiotropy exists for molecular phenotypes. Large-scale expression QTL (eQTL) mapping studies have identified single regulatory variants that control expression and likely the functions of hundreds of genes at once, opening a window into the mechanisms for how traits are controlled (Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010; Breitling et al. 2008; Hasin-Brumshtein et al. 2016; Keurentjes et al. 2007 ; Frank Wolfgang Albert et al. 2018; Frank W.

Mono-ADP-ribosylation by ARTD10 restricts Chikungunya virus replication by interfering with the proteolytic activity of nsP2 2 3 4,"24 A subset of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka 25 mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons. Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral 26 activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-27 ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus 28 conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a 29 macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. 30 This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in 31 replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection 32 are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication 33 and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified 34 ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-35 dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein 36 nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a 37 functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction 38 of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a 39 decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This 40 suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a 41 hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We 42 hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found 43 that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing 44 polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized 45 by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic 46 explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. 47 Author Summary 48 Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever 49 new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased 50 human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause 51 world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic 52 rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs 53 are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic 54 function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-55 ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this 56 modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because 57 macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets. 58 59 Introduction 60 Upon viral infection host cells initiate an antiviral immune response. Because the regulation 61 of protein function through post-translational modifications (PTMs) is among the quickest 62 mechanisms to adapt to challenges such as viral infections, PTMs display an essential part of 63 antiviral signaling. Viruses have developed multifaceted strategies to evade or even hijack 64 cellular mechanisms, e.g. encoding proteins that regulate PTMs and thereby counteract the 65 antiviral reaction of the host [1-5]. Recent findings have elaborated on the role of intracellular 66 ADP-ribosylation at the host-pathogen interface [6-12]. ADP-ribosylation is an ancient PTM of 67 proteins and intracellularly mainly catalyzed by members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 68 diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases (PARPs)), 69",.

Quantifying the success of measles vaccination campaigns in the Rohingya refugee camps,"In the wake of the Rohingya population's mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world's largest 10 refugee settlements was constructed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new 11 refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many 12 population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among 13 the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological 14 parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness 15 of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent 16 outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of 17 the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance 18 of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low 19 vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.","3 .

Characterizing the transmission and identifying the control strategy for COVID-19 through epidemiological modeling,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, a city located in central China, in early December, is fast spreading to more than 30 countries (Benvenuto et al., 2020; She et al., 2020) . In less than 3 months, the disease has infected more than 70,000 people globally, and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. On January 30 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. Upon composing this manuscript, the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day. This outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic."
Estimating the Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 using Cases from Outside China,"There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China. Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.","The new coronavirus appears to be fairly transmissible [1] , and is spreading in China. Disease severity is a particularly important parameter for understanding this new disease [1] , but unfortunately, the case fatality risk (CFR) data from China is difficult to interpret owing to likely missed mild cases (including due to a lack of appropriate test kits early in the epidemic) and also the likely delay in deaths occurring. Such a prolonged time course is suggested by a case series of 138 cases from Wuhan, China with cases enrolled between 1-28 January 2020. For this group on 3 February, 62% were still hospitalised and 31% (11/36) of those admitted to ICU were still there (6 had died) [2] ."
Glycosylation of Zika Virus Is Important in Host-Virus Interaction and Pathogenesis 1 USA,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe 33 developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. Because ZIKV uses 34 glycosylation of its envelope (E) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, 35 these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. Due to a lack 36 of information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains 37 derived from different cells. ZIKV E proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, 38 hybrid-and complex-N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. Host cell-surface glycans 39 correlated strongly with the glycomic features of ZIKV E. Mechanistically, we discovered that 40 ZIKV N-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific C-type lectins DC-41 SIGN and L-SIGN mediate cell entry of ZIKV.

Viral long-term evolutionary strategies favor stability 1 over proliferation,"Viruses are known to have some of the highest and most diverse mutation rates found 12 in any biological replicator, with single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses evolving the fastest, 13 and double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses having rates approaching those of bacteria. As 14 mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear 15 driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of 16 viral evolution is still unclear. To understand how these two processes affect the long-17 term evolution of viruses infecting humans, we comprehensively analyzed ssRNA, ssDNA, 18 dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus types and which functions show evidence 19 for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that selection mostly 20 affects single stranded viruses, that correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, 21 and that both processes, taken independently, mostly affect viral replication. However, 22 the genes that are jointly affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life 23 cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary 24 processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that it is the 25 joint action of selection and correlated evolution, and not just selection, that shapes the 26 evolutionary trajectories of viruses -and possibly of their epidemiological potential.","Humanity is regularly reminded of the epidemiological toll of viruses, in part due to recent To date, one of the most salient evolutionary feature shared by all viruses is the ex-38 istence of a negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size Holmes (2009) . 39 This is a critical result as it suggests that selection is driving the evolution of mutation The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Collaborative Cross Mouse Populations as a Resource for the Study of Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with complex etiologies and genetic architecture. Animal models have a critical role in understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Here we studied epilepsy utilizing a genetic reference population of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice with publicly available whole genome sequences. We measured multiple epilepsy traits in 35 CC strains, and we identified novel animal models that exhibit extreme outcomes in seizure susceptibility, seizure propagation, epileptogenesis, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We performed QTL mapping in an F2 population and identified seven novel and one previously identified loci associated with seizure sensitivity. We combined whole genome sequence and hippocampal gene expression to pinpoint biologically plausible candidate genes and candidate variants associated with seizure sensitivity. These resources provide a powerful toolbox for studying complex features of seizures and for identifying genes associated with particular seizure outcomes, and hence will facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

There are no treatments to prevent epilepsy, and roughly 30% of epilepsies are intractable to current antiepileptic medications 2 . Uncontrolled seizures also increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), a poorly understood fatal complication of epilepsy 3 . New transformative treatments could be developed by understanding the genetic associations conferring risk or protective effects. In addition to rapid expansion of epilepsy-associated gene list discovered mainly with monogenic causes of seizures, human GWAS studies of generalized epilepsy identified more than a dozen novel genome-wide significant loci and biological plausible candidate genes [4] [5] [6] . However, human GWAS approaches have had limited success in identifying risk loci associated with certain forms of epilepsy (e.g. partial epilepsy) and specific seizure outcomes (e.g. SUDEP), partially due to complex disease etiologies and underpowered sample sizes 7, 8 . Animal studies remain essential for understanding the mechanisms of epilepsy and for identifying new therapeutic targets. In particular, animal models offer phenotypic repeatability and a means to study a trait in a controlled environment, as well as providing a level of experimental testing and validation that is not ethical or possible in human subjects, such as in the case of SUDEP. Most existing animal models of complex diseases such as epilepsy are limited because they do not mirror the genetic diversity found in the human population. In order to identify novel genetic targets, a model research population with a high level of genetic variation is needed."
Hotspots of aberrant enhancer activity in fibrolamellar carcinoma reveal molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and intrinsic drug resistance,"Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, therapeutically intractable liver cancer that disproportionately affects youth.

Here we used chromatin run-on sequencing to discover approximately 7,000 enhancers and 141 enhancer hotspots activated in FLC relative to non-malignant liver. Detailed bioinformatic analyses revealed aberrant ERK/MEK signaling and candidate master transcriptional regulators. We also defined the genes most strongly associated with aberrant FLC enhancer activity, including CA12 and SLC16A14. Treatment of FLC cell models with inhibitors of CA12 or SLC16A14 independently reduced cell viability and/or significantly enhanced the effect of MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. These findings highlight new molecular targets for drug development as well as novel drug combination approaches.","Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare type of liver cancer that predominantly affects adolescents and young adults with no prior history of liver disease (Craig et al., 1980; Torbenson, 2012) . Currently, surgical resection is the only effective treatment for FLC, however most patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, making surgical cures difficult (Stipa et al., 2006) . While some patients have been successfully treated with chemotherapy and molecular therapies, there is no standard treatment regimen for FLC patients (Torbenson, 2012) . Furthermore, FLC is often drug resistant and frequently recurs following initial treatment (Maniaci et al., 2009) , underscoring the need to develop effective therapies for this cancer. FLC is genetically characterized by a ~400 kb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 19 that leads to the formation of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion (Honeyman et al., 2014) . This fusion occurs in at least 80% of patients (Cornella et al., 2014; Honeyman et al., 2014) , is specific to FLC (Dinh et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2015; Kastenhuber et al., 2017) , and is sufficient to drive liver tumor formation in mice (Engelholm et al., 2017; Kastenhuber et al., 2017) . Multiple groups have performed genome-scale analyses to identify dysregulated genes (Cornella et al., 2014; Dinh et al., 2017; Griffith et al., 2016; Malouf et al., 2014; Simon et al., 2015; Sorenson et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2014) , long non-coding RNAs (Dinh et al., 2017) , and microRNAs (Dinh et al., 2019; Farber et al., 2018) in FLC. Yet, little is known about the causative transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that lead to aberrant gene expression and FLC tumor formation."
PhyloFold: Precise and Swift Prediction of RNA Secondary Structures to Incorporate Phylogeny among Homologs Associate Editor: XXXXXXX Received on XXXXX; revised on XXXXX; accepted on XXXXX,"The simultaneous consideration of sequence alignment and RNA secondary structure, or structural alignment, is known to help predict more accurate secondary structures of homologs. However, the consideration is heavy and can be done only roughly to decompose structural alignments.","A large quantity of functional ncRNAs have been discovered through sequencing technology, including high throughput sequencing (Maxam and Gilbert, 1977; Bentley et al., 2008) . The RNAs are related to various biological processes such as epigenetic silencing (Pasmant et al., 2011) , splicing regulation (Ji et al., 2003) , translational control (Long and Caceres, 2009 ), apoptosis regulation, and cell cycle control (Kino et al., 2010) . However, the functions of a large number of RNAs have not yet been uncovered. Secondary structures of the RNAs are an important key to uncovering the functions of the RNAs because the structures play critical roles in biological processes, (Wu et al., 1991) and secondary structures are often conserved among homologs even in the case where the sequences of the homologs are nonconserved. (Klein and Eddy, 2003) To more correctly predict secondary structures, simultaneous consideration of sequence alignment and secondary structure, or structural alignment (Sankoff, 1985; Hofacker et al., 2004; Havgaard et al., 2007) , has been taken into account. (Hamada et al., 2009c (Hamada et al., , 2011 Tan et al., 2017) However, the consideration has been proven intractable (Sankoff, 1985) and thus has been conducted roughly to decompose structural alignments. (Hamada et al., 2009c,a; Sato et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2017) To more accurately accomplish this goal, the PhyloFold method ( Figure 1 ) was developed in this study. The method predicts secondary structures of homologs considering likely pairwise structual alignments between the homologs by a sparsification technique. (1) The method computes pairwise structural alignment probabilities for each pair of input homologs."
"Title: The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infections among travellers from Wuhan, China","Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.","Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the infectious agent that causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the first cases had their symptom onset in December 2019 [1] . This newly discovered virus causes a severe acute respiratory disease. The rapid spread in Wuhan and throughout China poses a great strain on health care system and disrupts the local societies. The multiple cases showing up outside China cause international concern."
50-valent inactivated rhinovirus vaccine is broadly immunogenic in rhesus macaques,"As the predominant etiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is 19 the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed monovalent formalin-20 inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated 21 with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine 22 efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing 23 virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, 24 we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, 25 inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice 26 and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient 27 quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the 28 response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to 29 numerous and diverse HRV types.","HRV causes respiratory illness in billions of people annually, a socioeconomic burden 1 . 33 HRV also causes pneumonia hospitalizations in children and adults and exacerbations of asthma 34 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 2 . HRV was found to be the second leading 35 cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in US children, second only 36 to respiratory syncytial virus, and the most common pathogen associated with pneumonia 37 hospitalization in US adults 3,4 . A vaccine for HRV could alleviate serious disease in asthma and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a correlate of protection, and estimated duration of 41 immunity 5-11 .

Multiplex logic processing isothermal diagnostic assays for an evolving virus,"We have developed a generalizable 'smart molecular diagnostic' capable of accurate point-ofcare (POC) detection of variable nucleic acid targets. Our one-pot isothermal assay relies on multiplex execution of four loop-mediated isothermal amplification reactions, with primers that are degenerate and redundant, thereby increasing the breadth of targets while reducing the probability of amplification failure. An easy-to-read visual answer is computed directly by a multi-input Boolean OR gate signal transducer that uses degenerate strand exchange probes to assess any combination of amplicons. We demonstrate our platform by using the same assay to detect divergent Asian and African lineages of the evolving Zika virus (ZIKV), while maintaining selectivity against non-target viruses. Direct analysis of biological specimens proved possible, with 20 virions / µl being directly detected in human saliva within 90 minutes, and crudely macerated ZIKV-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes being identified with 100% specificity and sensitivity.","In contrast, isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) have been developed that rival PCR in sensitivity, cost far less, and do not necessarily rely on complex instrumentation. 4 To further the adoption of these assays, we and others have begun to develop 'smart molecular diagnostics' that can integrate information at the molecular level. For example, to increase signal specificity, a variety of sequence-specific probes, including molecular beacons, nucleasedependent probes, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs have been adapted to isothermal amplification assays such as rolling circle amplification (RCA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), or loop-mediated amplification (LAMP). 5, 6, 7 More recently, RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes, such as Cas13a and Cas12a, have been used to signal the presence of isothermally generated amplicons. 8, 9 In our own previous work, we developed oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes, 10 that were triggered by strand exchange reactions with transiently single-stranded stem-loop sequences. 11 This led to the exquisitely sensitive detection of LAMP amplicons without interference. 12 One-pot LAMP-OSD assays that can work with crude samples are especially appealing for POC use. 13, 14 These assays have been coupled to highly sensitive and reliable 'yes/no' output signals such as fluorescence, glucose, or hCG that can be readily read using offthe-shelf cellphones, glucometers, or pregnancy test strips, respectively. 12, 13, 15 16, 17, 18, 19 Toehold switch RNA sensors have also been used to link iNAATs with in vitro reporter protein translation, leading to colorimetric signals. 20 Even as these iNAAT tests move towards wider adoption, they all still face the same problem as other POC assays, in that the answers they give are relatively simplistic. However, given that the strand exchange reactions that underlie OSD probes were originally derived from far more complex DNA computations, 10, 21, 22, 23 it may be possible to go beyond mere improvements in specificity and to integrate additional desirable features directly into the molecular diagnostic itself, such that the reaction helps to 'compute' its own outcome. As examples, we have previously developed strand exchange computation modules that can quantitate inputs to isothermal amplification reactions, 24 or that can integrate multiple molecular signals via Boolean logic operations. 17 We now attempt to take on real-world problems with computations that are embedded in the smart molecular diagnostics themselves. It is unfortunately a fundamental fact that diagnostic targets often evolve faster than assays designed to detect them. The resulting target sequence variations can easily prevent recognition of assay primers and probes, leading to test failure and false negative readouts, a problem which to date can only be solved via regular (and impractical) assay updates. 25, 26 For instance, primers and probes for all eight published reverse transcription (RT) qPCR assays (qRT-PCR) for Zika virus (ZIKV) were found to have numerous mismatches with multiple ZIKV genomes sequenced from recent outbreaks. 27 Some 20%-80% of ZIKV-infected patients are believed to have remained undiagnosed due to this incompatibility. 27, 28 To overcome this problem and increase the overall accuracy of POC nucleic acid testing we have engineered additional computations into our smart molecular diagnostics that can compute the presence of almost any ZIKV variant. Strategic degenerate bases in 21 multiplexed primers allow the amplification of multiple ZIKV viral genes and gene variants in four, simultaneous LAMP reactions. The presence of any positive signal is calculated by multi-input Boolean 'OR'gated logic processors in a single one-pot reaction that directly analyzes crude biological samples and provides a visual yes/no readout for any ZIKV variant within 60-90 min. As with previous LAMP-OSD assays, the exquisite sequence-specificity of oligonucleotide strand exchange probes ensures signal specificity, while the built-in assay redundancy of the molecular logic processors guards against false negatives."

Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution,"doi: bioRxiv preprint molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intraspecies variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection. 3 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 author/funder.

IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at subcodon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33-40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3' untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes."

"Title: 2 The Role of Interleukin-1 cytokine family (IL-1β, IL-37) and interleukin-12 cytokine 3 family (IL-12, IL-35) in eumycetoma infection pathogenesis. Authors 7 Corresponding Author","Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, 49 characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and 50 appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an 51 important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these 52 interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma 53 has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1β, 54 IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association 55 between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, 56 a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University 57 Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided 58 into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 59 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 60 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 61 (ELISA). 62 There was no significant correlation between the IL-1β and IL-12 levels and the lesions size 63 and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with 64 that. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of 65 mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1β cytokine, where a unit 66 increment in IL-1β will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 67 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≤ one year had significantly 68 decreased by an average of 18.45 compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's 69 duration of ≥ 5years (reference group).

This infection progresses to affect pre-existing Th2 environment caused by schistosomiasis promotes the development of 140 mycetoma as patients with mycetoma were significantly more positive for schistosoma 141 antibodies than healthy endemic controls [9] . These findings suggested that Th2 like 142 response and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokines could have a negative impact 143 on mycetoma development and disease progression. 144 IL-1 is a polypeptide which has two forms; IL-1α and IL-1β. It is involved in the acute-phase 145 response and is accountable for several alterations that are related to the onset of various 146 medical disorders [15, 16] . It is demonstrated recently that higher levels of IL-1β cytokine 147 are strongly associated with surgically treated mycetoma patients, in comparison to those 148 treated without surgery [17] . It is known that IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is 149 involved in cell death coordination [18] . IL-1β cytokine is cleaved into the mature, active and disease severity in murine aspergillosis [29] . In addition to its role in innate immunity; IL-174 37 plays a pivotal role in regulating adaptive immunity by inducing regulatory T (T reg ) cells 175 and impairing activation of effector T-cell responses [30] . To our knowledge, there has been 176 no study to report the relationship between IL-37 and mycetoma pathogenesis so far. poorly understood. However IL-35 is recognised as a typical anti-inflammatory cytokine, and 189 the predominant mechanism of suppression is associated with its ability to suppress T cell (Table 2) .

Amongst the cases in Mainland China, 2239 cases died, 11 cases of death was reported from out of Mainland China. 7 There were 41 initial cases of COVID-19 that were directly or indirectly linked to the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as reported by Huang and colleagues. 8 The clinical features include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, decreased leukocyte counts and computed tomography (CT) evidence of pneumonia. 8 Subsequently, Chen and colleagues reported 99 cases from a single centre of Wuhan, but the severe and non-severe cases were not compared. 9 And then Wang and colleagues published a study based on 138 hospitalized patients from Wuhan. 10 However, all these studies are based on cases identified in Wuhan.

Capturing diverse microbial sequence with comprehensive and scalable probe design,"Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to transform microbial detection and characterization, but new tools are needed to improve its sensitivity. We developed CATCH (Compact Aggregation of Targets for Comprehensive Hybridization), a computational method to enhance nucleic acid capture for enrichment of diverse microbial taxa. CATCH designs compact probe sets that achieve full coverage of known sequence diversity and that scale well with this diversity. To illustrate applications of CATCH, we focused on capturing viral genomes. We designed, synthesized, and validated multiple probe sets, including one that targets whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriched unique viral content on average 18× and allowed us to assemble genomes that we could not otherwise recover, while accurately preserving within-sample diversity. We used this approach to recover genomes from the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria and to improve detection of viral infections in samples with unknown content. Together, this work demonstrates a path toward more sensitive, cost-effective metagenomic sequencing.","Sequencing of patient samples has revolutionized the detection and characterization of important human viral pathogens 1 and has enabled crucial insights into their evolution and epidemiology [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Unbiased metagenomic sequencing is particularly useful for identifying and obtaining genome sequences of emerging or diverse species because it allows accurate detection of species and variants whether they are known or novel 1 . However, in practice its utility is often limited because of extremely low viral titers, e.g., as seen in the recent Zika virus outbreak [7] [8] [9] , or high levels of host material 10 . The low ratio of viral to host material results in few viral-derived sequencing reads, which can make genome assembly, if even attainable, prohibitively expensive. To fully realize the potential of metagenomic sequencing, we need new tools that improve its sensitivity while preserving its comprehensive, unbiased scope."

Real-time projections of epidemic transmission and estimation of vaccination impact during an Ebola virus disease outbreak in Northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo,"Background: As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak with case-count time series from prior outbreaks to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak.","During an Ebola outbreak, real-time forecasting has the potential to support 28 decision-making and allocation of resources, but highly accurate forecasts have proven 29 difficult for Ebola [8, 9] as well as other diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] . Highly accurate forecasts of 30 small, noisy outbreaks may be a fundamentally elusive ideal [14] . Previous work has 31 found that probabilistic forecasts can have relatively high accuracy within a few weeks, 32 though they become less useful as time horizons grow longer [15] . Thus, short-term against subsequently known counts. Although the epidemic was officially reported on 63 August 1 as a cluster of cases occurring in June and July, seven sporadic early cases 64 from April and May were subsequently linked to the current outbreak and were added 65 to later case totals [3] . This additional knowledge was added retrospectively to the time 66 series of cumulative case counts only for predictions made for days on or after 67 September 15, when these cases were officially linked to the current outbreak. 68 Stochastic model 69 We modeled Ebola virus (EBOV) transmission using a stochastic branching process 70 model, parameterized by transmission rates estimated from the dynamics of prior EVD 71 outbreaks and conditioned on agreement with reported case counts from the 2018 EVD 72 outbreak to date. We incorporated high and low estimates of vaccination coverage into 73 this model. We used this model to generate a set of probabilistic projections of the size 74 of simulated outbreaks in the current setting. This model is similar to one described in 75 previous work [16] , with the addition of a smoothing step allowing for a continuum of 76 transmission rates interpolated between those estimated from prior outbreaks. 77 On the assumption that past outbreaks provide a basis for projection of the current 78 outbreak, we used estimates of transmission rates from past EVD outbreaks to 79 parameterize simulations of the current outbreak. To estimate the reproduction number 80 R in past outbreaks as a function of the number of days from the beginning of the 81 outbreak, we included reported cases by date from fourteen prior outbreaks (Table S1 in 82 S1 Supporting Information), [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . To reflect the Ebola response system in DRC 83 during what is now its tenth outbreak, the first historical outbreak reported in each 84 country was excluded (e.g. the 1976 outbreak in Yambuko, DRC), as there is a 85 difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD 86 following a country's first outbreak. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate 87 R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in these outbreaks [31] . The serial 88 interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 89 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest 90 whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD 91 cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days. Transmission rates estimated by day in these outbreaks tend to decline from initially 93 high to eventually low values, though they may display substantial fluctuations. This 94 ""quenching"" of transmission may be driven by formal interventions such as quarantine, or 95 by informal changes in individuals' behavior in response to the disease or by depletion 96 of uninfected contacts of infective individuals, or by other causes. We incorporated this 97 pattern into our model by estimating an initial reproduction number R initial and 98 quenching rate τ for each outbreak by fitting an exponentially quenched curve to the 99 outbreak's estimates of R by day d (Fig S2 in S1 Supporting Information), and used 100 these pairs of parameters, one from each past outbreak, to construct a joint distribution 101 of initial reproduction numbers and quenching rates for outbreak simulation. 102 We simulated EBOV transmission using a stochastic branching process model in 103 which the number of secondary cases caused by any given primary case is drawn from a 104 negative binomial distribution, whose mean is the reproduction number R as a function 105 of day of the outbreak, and variance is controlled by a dispersion parameter k [32, 33]. 106"
Title: Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.","Similar to outbreaks of other respiratory pathogens (1) (2) (3) (4) , syndromic airport screening at arrival of travellers from regions with a high risk of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of infected travellers to prevent global spread (5, 6) . Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and to encourage selfisolation as well as rapidly seeking for medical assistance via telephone which in turn will trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts, may have a more pronounced effect and is currently implemented in many transport hubs. However, with increasing numbers of infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the immensely resourceintensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent local transmission in the long term (7) ."

Deep sequencing of primary human lung epithelial cells challenged with H5N1 influenza virus reveals 1 a proviral role for CEACAM1 2 3,"15 Current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies targeting human influenza viruses include 16 vaccines and antivirals. Given variable rates of vaccine efficacy and antiviral resistance, 17 alternative strategies are urgently required to improve disease outcomes. Here we describe the 18 use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar 19 epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours 20 post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly up-regulated, including the cell adhesion 21 molecule CEACAM1. The up-regulation of CEACAM1 was blocked in the presence of the 22 reactive oxygen species inhibitor, apocynin. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher 23 CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to low pathogenic PR8 H1N1 virus, suggesting a 24 key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous 25 CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as 26 well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides 27 evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and 28 may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies. 29 30 IMPORTANCE 31",regulates the innate immune response in a clinically relevant in vitro human model of H5N1 39 infection. 40
Mortality of COVID-19 is Associated with Cellular Immune Function Compared to Immune Function in Chinese Han Population,"Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8 (IQR, 0.6-1.1) 10 9 /L in Wuhan, 1.0 (IQR, 0.7-1.4) 10 9 /L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 10 9 /L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality.

,"The large magnitude of protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs within the human interactome necessitates the development of predictive models and screening tools to better understand this fundamental molecular communication. However, despite enormous efforts from various groups to develop predictive techniques in the last decade, PPI complex structures are in general still very challenging to predict due to the large number of degrees of freedom. In this study, we use the binding complex of human profilin (PFN1) and polyproline-10 (P10) as a model system to examine various approaches, with the aim of going beyond normal protein docking for PPI prediction and evaluation. The potential of mean force (PMF) was first obtained from the timeconsuming umbrella sampling, which confirmed that the most stable binding structure identified by the maximal PMF difference is indeed the crystallographic binding structure. Moreover, crucial residues previously identified in experimental studies, W3, H133 and S137 of PFN1, were found to form favorable hydrogen bonds with P10, suggesting a zipping process during the binding between PFN1 and P10. We then explored both regular molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, seeking for better criteria of ranking the PPI prediction. Despite valuable information obtained from conventional MD simulations, neither the commonly used interaction energy between the two binding parties nor the long-term root mean square displacement (RMSD) correlates well with the PMF results. On the other hand, with a sizable collection of trajectories, we demonstrated that the average rupture work calculated from SMD simulations correlates fairly well with the PMFs (R 2 = 0.67), making it a promising PPI screening method.

Interleukin-33 promotes type 1 cytokine expression via p38 MAPK in human natural killer cells,"This study tests the hypothesis that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by physiologically-relevant concentrations of interleukin-33 (IL-33) contributes to enhanced cytokine expression by IL-12 stimulated human natural killer (NK) cells. While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN- by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN- and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Natural killer (NK) cells play a key role in the clearance of virus-infected cells and the pathogenesis of many diseases [1] [2] [3] . The type 1 cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) provokes a canonical interferon-gamma (IFN-) response by NK cells 4 . Other type 1 cytokines, including IL-15, IL-18 and IL-1 enhance IL-12-induced IFN- release by NK cells [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . This type 1 cytokine synergy can also promote enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Thus, type 1 cytokine rich environments associated with immune insults such as infection or injury can stimulate cytokine responses from NK cells that further promote type 1 responses. For example, in the experimental model of Leishmania infantum, the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 is critical for NK-cell IFN- expression 11 ."
Proofreading-deficient coronaviruses adapt over long-term passage for increased fidelity and 1 fitness without reversion of exoribonuclease-inactivating mutations 2 3 4,"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA 23 viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3¢à5¢exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 24 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN 25 catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN 26 activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased 27 fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) 28 genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in 29 parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated 30 enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive 31 fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-32 inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA 33 polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the 34 observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness 35 observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can 36 compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN.

These data suggest that the increased replication of P250 173 viruses relative to WT-MHV is not fully accounted for by increased RNA synthesis. In addition 174 to RNA synthesis defects, ExoN(-) CoVs have up-to 20-fold increased mutation frequencies and 175 profoundly increased sensitivity to nucleoside and base analogs relative to WT CoVs (13, 14, 16, 176 17, 38). To determine whether nucleoside analog sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) was altered by 177 long-term passage, we treated cells infected with parental and passaged viruses with the base 178 analog, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is converted intracellularly into a nucleoside analog that 179 incorporates into growing RNA strands and causes A:G and U:C mutations. For simplicity, we 180 hereafter refer to 5-FU as a nucleoside analog. Incorporation of 5-FU is increased in the absence 181 of ExoN activity (16). All viruses displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in viral titer but 182 differed greatly in their susceptibility to 5-FU (Fig. 4C ). At 120µM, WT-MHV P3 titers were 183 reduced by ~1 log 10 , while MHV-ExoN(-) P3 titers were undetectable (> 5 log 10 -fold reduction). 184"

Therapeutic effects of dipyridamole on COVID-19 patients with 1 coagulation dysfunction,"The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective 48 antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the 49 overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent 50 dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited 51 potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In 52 analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found 53 that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts 54 and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP 55 treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the 56 hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time 57 of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 58 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, 59 suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery.

In a VSV-induced pneumonia model, we also confirmed that DIP 108 elicited potent antiviral immunity and significantly improved the survival rate. In a small clinical 109 cohort, we found that DIP adjunctive therapy led to increased circulating lymphocyte and platelet 110 counts and lowered D-dimer levels, and markedly improved clinical outcomes."
Complete genome characterisation of a novel coronavirus 4 associated with severe human respiratory disease in Wuhan,"bioRxiv preprint 2 Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika and highly 25 pathogenic influenza present a major threat to public health 1-3 . Despite intense research 26 effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable 27 uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, 28 Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been 29 reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12 nd 2019. Epidemiological 30 investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested 31 that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven 32 patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 33 (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, 34 dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 35 26 th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing 4 identified a novel RNA virus 36 from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV). 37 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that 38 WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of 39 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, 40 subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history 41 of genomic recombination.

The clinical characteristics of the patients 47 are shown in Table 1. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms. All patients had 48 fever with body temperatures ranging from 37.2 o C to 40 o C. Patients 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 had 49 cough, while patients 1, 2 and 7 presented with severe cough with phlegm at onset of illness. 50 Patients 4 and 5 also complained of chest tightness and dyspnea. Patients 1, 3, 4 and 6 51 experienced dizziness and patient 3 felt weakness. No neurological symptoms were observed 52 in any of the patients. Bacterial culture revealed the presence of Streptococcus bacteria in 53 throat swabs from patients 3, 4 and 7. Combination antibiotic, antiviral and glucocorticoid 54 therapy were administered.

Of the 93 384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit 8 , the longest (30,474 nucleotides [nt]) had high 94 abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate -bat-SL-CoVZC45 95 (GenBank Accession MG772933) -previously sampled in China, with a nt identity of 89.1% 96 (Table S1 and S2). The genome sequence of this novel virus, as well as its termini, were 97 determined and confirmed by RT-PCR 9 and 5'/3' RACE kits (TaKaRa), respectively. This 98 new virus was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has also been referred 99 to as '2019-nCoV') and its whole genome sequence (29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank 100 accession number MN908947.

The viral load in the BALF sample 103 was estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to be 3.95×10 8 copies/mL ( Figure S3 ). 104 The viral genome organization of WHCV was characterized by sequence alignment 105 against two representative members of the genus Betacoronavirus: a human-origin 106 coronavirus (SARS-CoV Tor2, AY274119) and a bat-origin coronavirus 107 MG772933) (Figure 2 ). The un-translational regions (UTR) and open reading frame (ORF) of 108 WHCV were mapped based on this sequence alignment and ORF prediction.

Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China,"Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases.","In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origins were identified in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China [1] . High-throughput sequencing has revealed a novel betacoronavirus that is currently named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2] , which resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] . The 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus (subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) [3] . Evidence pointing to the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings has been accumulating [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ."
CORRELATION OF MRNA DELIVERY TIMING AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN LIPID-BASED TRANSFECTION,"Non-viral gene delivery is constrained by the dwell time that most synthetic nucleic acid nanocarriers spend inside endosomal compartments. In order to overcome this endosomalrelease bottleneck, methods are required that measure nanocarrier uptake kinetics and transfection efficiency simultaneously. Here, we employ live-cell imaging on single-cell arrays (LISCA) to study the delivery-time distribution of lipid-based mRNA complexes under varied serum conditions. By fitting a translation-maturation model to hundreds of individual eGFP reporter fluorescence time courses, the protein expression onset times and the expression rates after transfection are determined. Using this approach, we find that delivery timing and protein expression rates are not intrinsically correlated at the single-cell level, even though population-averaged values of both parameters conjointly change as a function of increasing external serum protein fraction. Lipofectamine mediated delivery showed decreased transfection efficiency and longer delivery times with increasing serum protein concentration. This is in contrast to ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) mediated transfer, which showed increased efficiency and faster uptake in the presence of serum. In conclusion, the interdependences of single-cell expression rates and onset timing provide additional clues on uptake and release mechanisms, which are useful for improving nucleic acid delivery. author/funder.

However, clinical applications are still limited due to the difficulties inherent in delivery of nucleic acids in vivo (1, 2) . Over the last years, intense research is dedicated to develop non-viral vectors that are capable to safely and efficiently package, transport and systemically deliver nucleic acid to cells (3) (4) (5) . In particular for therapeutic purposes, there is need to deliver DNA, mRNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA). The molecular and cellular processes of nucleic acid nanoparticles share common structural features and entry mechanisms. Some of the major challenges associated with current cationic lipid vectors are the interaction with blood serum components, impaired intracellular uptake, limited release into the cytosol and immunological response (6, 7) . Each of these hurdles are independently affected by variations in the lipid formulations and transfection conditions. Lipid-encapsulated RNA is taken up by various, endosomal or phagocytotic, uptake mechanisms and subsequent intracellular pathways. It appears however, that nucleic acids nanocarriers are largely trapped inside the endosomes or lysosomes and that delivery by lipid nanoparticles is limited by endocytic recycling (8) . In timeresolved fluorescence microscopy studies, the uptake and fate of delivery particles has been visualized at the single-cell level (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Recently, it was shown that siRNA release occurred during a narrow 'window of opportunity' showing that timing and efficiency are linked (12) . However, the uptake pathways and factors that control endosomal release of lipid-based nanocarriers are not fully resolved. In particular, the interdependence of timing and efficiency of gene delivery and the role of extracellular factors on the kinetics of cellular uptake and endosomal release are poorly understood aspects in the delivery process."
Processing of the SARS-CoV pp1a/ab nsp7-10 region,Abstract,"The human pathogenic potential of zoonotic infections by coronaviruses was exposed by the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as causative agent of the SARS epidemic in 2003 [1, 2] . The replicase gene ORF 1ab occupies two thirds of the CoV single-strand (+)sense RNA genome. Initially, ORF1ab is directly translated into either replicase polyprotein pp1a (nsp1-11) or pp1ab (nsp1-16), depending on a ribosomal (-1)-frameshift [3] . Subsequently, the polyproteins undergo proteolytic processing into 11 or 16 individual nsp's. Eventually, the nsp's take part in forming the RTC, a membrane-anchored, highly dynamic protein-RNA complex facilitating the replicative processes [4] [5] [6] [7] ."
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-RBD Structure and Receptor Binding Comparison and Potential Implications on Neutralizing Antibody and Vaccine Development,"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.","In December 2019, outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has brought back the attention of pathogenic coronavirus to the spotlight [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .

"A quantitative framework to define the end of an outbreak: application to Ebola Virus Disease ""A quantitative framework to define the end of an outbreak: application to Ebola Virus Disease""","Declaring the end of an outbreak is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulationbased model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-ofoutbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.","Declaring the end of an outbreak (EO) is a critical programmatic step in outbreak response. Any infectious disease outbreak can be devastating for affected populations and areas as alongside burden from infections and mortality, the outbreak status of a region or a country can influence other vital sectors such as: social, economic, political, and security (1) (2) (3) . In defining the EO, it is crucial to consider the risk of cases arising in the future using objective quantitative methods. A well-timed declaration of EO is essential as it would allow affected countries to address problems in other sectors, reallocate healthcare resources to cover other important public health issues, and start post-outbreak recovery efforts."
"In silico study of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2: similarity with SARS-CoV, hot-spot analysis and effect of the receptor polymorphism","The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Proteinprotein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein : bioRxiv preprint 2 docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as nCoV -19) has been 4 associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 [9] , [2] . Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 6 receptor on the surface of the host cell using the spike protein and explored 7 the binary interaction of these two partners [4, 12, 28] . In this work, we 8 focused our analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main 9 subjects: (1) The architecture of the interface of the spike protein and 10 whether its evolution in many isolates supports an increase in affinity 11 toward the ACE2 receptor; (2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and 12 SARS-CoV-RBD toward different ACE2 homologous proteins from different 13 species is dictated by a divergent interface sequences (3); A comparison of 14 the interaction hotspots between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, 15 (4) whether any of the studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding 16 property compared to the reference allele.

Vitrification after multiple rounds of sample application and blotting improves particle density on cryo-electron microscopy grids,"Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming widely adopted as a tool for structural characterization of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozen-hydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies. The method is versatile, easy to implement, minimizes sample requirements and can enable characterization of samples that would otherwise resist structural studies using single particle cryoEM.","Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming an increasingly important tool in structural biology (Nogales and Scheres 2015; Cheng et al. 2015) . Due to recent advances in detector efficiency, microscope stability and image processing, the 3D structure of biomolecular complexes spanning a wide range of sizes, from haemoglobin to microtubules and intact viruses, can be reconstructed at (near-) atomic resolution (Bai et al. 2013; Brilot et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2015; Koshouei et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2010; Nogales 2015; Scheres 2012; Walls et al. 2016a; Walls et al. 2016b) ."
"Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42·9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.",". In addition, SARS-CoV was detected in urine, feces and tears of some SARS-CoV infected patients. It was confirmed that SARS-CoV could be transmitted through fecal-oral and contiguous pathways 6, 8 . Thus far, there has not been a report to show if SARS-CoV can be transmitted through sexual transmission. Therefore, based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV, current preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV 6 . However, different from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, another virus of the same coronavirus family, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread to several other countries 9,10 , was transmitted through large droplets and close contact, although the possibility of air transmission or dust mite transmission was not ruled out 9 . Also, it is not clear whether MERS-CoV is sexually transmitted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided recommendations for the prevention of MERS-CoV, mainly including droplet and contact precautions 11 . Interestingly, HCoV-229E in the coronavirus family was detected in the maternal vagina and also found in the gastric swab samples of newborns 12 . This makes the sexual transmission of this type of virus possible although there is no direct evidence to prove it. Therefore, it also remains possible that SARS-CoV-2, as a new type of coronavirus, could be sexually transmitted."
Genetic control of the HDL proteome,"High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are nanoparticles with >80 associated proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. A comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice, Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local, cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Variations in apolipoprotein A-II and apolipoprotein C-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of co-varying proteins and define a protein-protein interaction network describing the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1 specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size suggesting a multi genetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, supporting the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL's properties such as protection against CAD.","as well as larger HDL species that contain a large core of cholesteryl esters (Kontush et al., 2013; Yetukuri et al., 2010) . In humans, discrete classes of HDL based on size can be identified. In mice, HDL sizes are more continuous (LeBoeuf and Lusis, 1983 ) and represent one monodisperse peak. The size and levels of HDL vary in both human and mouse populations (Joshi et al., 2016; Pamir et al., 2016) . There are clear functional differences associated with the various size classes of HDL. In particular, the small lipid-poor particles are the best acceptors of cholesterol from cells and thus should be particularly important in mediating reverse cholesterol transport, whereas larger particles, associated with proteins such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and APOE, are likely to be important in protecting against inflammation. HDL particles containing proteins such as serum amyloid A (SAA) species tend to lack anti-inflammatory properties (Vaisar et al., 2015) . HDL-C levels have a skewed normal distribution in the general population, and the median levels vary by sex and ethnicity. Linkage based studies from the early 1980's have tried to identify the genetic factors that influence plasma HDL-C levels, but many findings have not been replicated due to polygenic nature of this trait, with contributions from multiple small-effect gene variants. Meta-analyses and GWAS results do, however, support the association of HDL-C with variation in CETP, LIPC, LPL, ABCA1, endothelial lipase (LIPG) and LCAT (Hegele, 2009; Thompson et al., 2008) . Multiple genetic factors could be present in an individual, creating a polygenic network of HDL-C determinants (Cohen et al., 2004) . These determinants include monogenic effectors, such rare homozygous mutations in ABCA1, LCAT, and APOA1 causing extremely low HDL-C (Brooks-Wilson et al., 1999; Kuivenhoven et al., 1996; Ng et al., 1994) , and rare homozygous mutations in CETP, LIPC, and SCARB1, causing extremely elevated HDL-C . The mouse models of these variants have been supportive of the human findings (Wang and Paigen, 2005) (Wang & Paigen, 2005) . Polygenic determinants have been recently investigated using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with extremely low and high HDL-C. About 30% of individuals at the extremes of HDL-C had rare large effect and common small effect variants explaining the trait (Dron et al., 2017) . Whereas the genetic determinants of plasma HDL-C levels have been well studied, the genetic determinants of HDL proteome and lipidome have never been previously investigated."
SEIR Transmission dynamics model of 2019 nCoV coronavirus with considering the weak infectious ability and changes in latency duration,"Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.","The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a major epidemic that humans are experiencing. As a kind of coronavirus, it poses a continuing threat to human health because of its high transmission efficiency and serious infection consequences [1] . Since the first case of novel coronavirus pneumonia was discovered in early Dec 2019, it has spread widely over the past two months. By the end of 10:00, Feb 10th, 2020, there were 42708 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection and 21675 suspected cases in China. At present, 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases have been confirmed in dozens of countries and regions including the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, and Japan."
A Toolkit for Rapid Modular Construction of Biological Circuits in Mammalian Cells,"The ability to rapidly assemble and prototype cellular circuits is vital for biological research and its applications in biotechnology and medicine. Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health. and Extensible Mammalian Modular Assembly kit (EMMA) 3 based on Golden Gate assembly reactions were proposed. Both methods use sets of modular parts with given functionality, which can be assembled directionally into transcription units (TUs) by type-IIS restriction enzymes. While useful, all three methods have important shortcomings. GMAP requires sequencing in between all cloning steps, which makes the method slow and expensive. EMMA and mMoClo provide a method to hierarchically assemble DNA vectors that encode large circuits, but fall short on shareability, integration of Cas9 sgRNA cloning, a library of tested parts, and ease of use. While in yeast and plant systems, methods for the rapid, efficient and hierarchical assembly of genetic circuits from a large library of well described modular parts [8] [9] [10] [11] exist, we are unaware that such a cloning toolkit for mammalian systems is readily available.","Molecular cloning is the cornerstone of modern biological research. It is required to generate DNA vectors that can encode a myriad of genetic circuits with applications in the fields of cell biology, therapeutics, virology, synthetic biology and biotechnology, among others. These circuits can encompass the expression of endogenous proteins, small RNAs, reporters of gene expression or cellular activity, and other innumerable reagents whose applications extend from basic discovery to medical applications. To move molecular cloning forward into an engineering discipline, with minimal trial and error and reproducible results, the parts that constitute engineered circuits need to be modular, vetted for their function and easy to share. To maximize the range of applications, circuits made from these parts need to be rapidly assembled, amenable to fast prototyping, and not bottlenecked by the delivery method to their target genomic integration sites."

Translational profiling of macrophages infected with Leishmania donovani identifies 2 mTOR-and eIF4A-sensitive immune-related transcripts,"24 The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a 25 chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. While previous studies showed that L. donovani 26 reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite 27 also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we 28 compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. 29 donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective 30 changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions 31 by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while 32 inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel 33 quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was 34 activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by 35 polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic 36 in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) 37 and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR 38 inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting 39 corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-β decreased in presence of the 40 eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite 41 modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. 42 donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under 43 mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR-and eIF4A-44 sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. 45 donovani-infected macrophages.

It is well established that the 51 protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell 52 functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-53 transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression 54 programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding 55 mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. 56 Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins 57 share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and 58 microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts 59 that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the 60 activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A 61 activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the 62 opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene 63 expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be 64 targeted for therapeutic intervention. : bioRxiv preprint 5 65 66 Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne infection caused by protozoan parasites of the 67 Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) complex. VL is endemic in more than 60 countries and is 68 frequently lethal if untreated (1). The lack of efficient vaccines and the failure to control 69 emerging parasite resistance reflect the urgent need to design safe and efficient therapeutics 70 targeting host-encoded factors (2). In mammalian hosts, Leishmania promastigotes preferentially 71 colonize macrophages, where they transform into replicative amastigotes that proliferate within 72 modified phagolysosomes (1). To establish a successful infection, the parasite dampens 73 antimicrobial responses, alters vesicle trafficking, and subverts immunomodulatory functions 74 and metabolic processes of the host cell (3). 75 76 At the molecular level, L. donovani modulates the activity of multiple host cell signaling 77 pathways and transcription factors (3). Consistently, profiling of mRNA levels in L. donovani-78 infected macrophages revealed vast perturbation in host gene expression programs associated 79 with parasite persistence (4-8). The pioneering data supporting widespread changes in host cell 80 mRNA levels following L. donovani infection were obtained in bone marrow-derived 81 macrophages (BMDMs) using cDNA-microarrays (4). This study showed that L. donovani 82 axenic amastigotes downregulate expression of genes involved in apoptosis and NF-κB signaling 83 while stimulating those encoding monocyte chemoattractants. Subsequently, DNA-microarray 84 based studies of human and mouse monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L. donovani 85 promastigotes identified increased levels of transcripts related to cell migration and repression of 86 genes encoding MHC class II molecules (5, 6). More recently, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of 87 mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with L. donovani showed a strong suppression of genes . CC-BY 4.0","9 142 changes in protein levels imposed by altered transcription or mRNA stability (24). Interestingly, 143 a large subset of transcripts whose abundance changed upon infection with L. donovani 144 amastigotes or promastigotes was buffered at the level of translation (21% out of 1,051 and 29% 145 out of 1,604 mRNAs, respectively) (Fig 1D and S1 Table) . In contrast, only a small number of 146 transcripts (71 mRNAs) whose levels differed between L. donovani promastigote-and 147 amastigote-infected BMDMs (S1B-C Figs) were translationally buffered. These data indicate (Fig 2A and S2 Table) . Enriched categories, among 157 proteins encoded by translationally activated transcripts in BMDMs infected by either parasite 158 life stage, included chromatin remodeling, regulation of mRNA metabolism (i.e. splicing, export 159 from the nucleus, stability and translation), regulation of type I IFN production and protein 160 deubiquitination (Fig 2A, 228 Translation of eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs is activated upon L. donovani infection 229 As mentioned above, the RNA helicase eIF4A facilitates translation of transcripts harboring long 230 and highly structured 5' UTR sequences. Some such encoded proteins are involved in tumor 231 immune evasion (36) and progression of viral (37) and protozoan parasitic infections (12), 232 suggesting that eIF4A-dependent translation may contribute to herein observed changes in 233 translational efficiencies (Fig 1) .

Consistent with eIF4B-235 dependent modulation of eIF4A activity, levels of phosphorylated and total eIF4B protein were 236 increased in BMDMs infected with L. donovani amastigotes or promastigotes (Fig 5A) . To test 237 whether this may contribute to selective regulation of mRNA translation following parasite 238 infection, we assessed translational efficiencies of a compilation of previously described eIF4A-239 sensitive transcripts (36, 38-40). Indeed, following infection independently of parasite stage, the 240 translational efficiencies of such mRNAs were elevated as compared to background transcripts 241 (p <0.001) (Fig 5B) . From a total of 1198 previously described eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs, 149 242 were translationally activated whereas 80 were translationally suppressed upon infection with 243 promastigotes or amastigotes of L. donovani (S3B Table) . The presence of a 5' UTR G-244 quadruplex-forming guanine quartet (CGG) 4 motif is an indirect approach to assess whether 245 transcripts are expected to be more dependent of eIF4A for their translation (41). Indeed, 246 analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME) revealed a significant enrichment of the (CGG) 4 motif in 5' 247 UTRs of transcripts with highly activated translation (≥4-fold increase in translational efficiency 248 upon infection) as compared to 5' UTRs from transcripts with unaltered translational efficiency 249 (p = 0.0036) (Fig 5C) . TGF-β is a key cytokine implicated in the distinctive immune suppression 250 that follows L. donovani infection in vivo (42, 43) . Upon infection with L. donovani amastigotes 251 or promastigotes, anota2seq analysis identified augmented translational efficiency of the tumor 252 growth factor-β 1 (Tgfb1) mRNA (Fig. 2B , top-right panel and S1 Table) , which is highly 253 dependent of eIF4A for its translation (39). Accordingly, production of TGF-β increased in 254 BMDMs upon infection (Fig 5D) without changes in Tgfb1 mRNA abundance (Fig 5E) ."
Long noncoding RNA AVAN promotes antiviral innate immunity by interacting with TRIM25 and enhancing the transcription of FOXO3a,"Accumulating evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in 25 several biological processes, including immune responses. However, the role of lncRNAs in 26 antiviral innate immune responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify an 27 uncharacterized human lncRNA from influenza A virus (IAV) patients, antivirus and activate 28 neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically, 29 nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) 30 by associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil 31 chemotaxis. Furthermore, we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds 32 tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and 33 Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby 34 promoting TRIM25-and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. More 35 importantly，we enforced the expression of AVAN in transgenic mice and found that it 36 significantly alleviated IAV virulence and virus production. Collectively, these findings 37 highlight the potential clinical implications of lncRNA-AVAN as a key positive regulator of 38 the antiviral innate immune response and a promising target for developing broad antiviral 39 therapeutics. 40 41","proliferation, genomic imprinting, and stem cell self-renewal (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . lncRNAs are also 48 reportedly involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, such as immune cell 49 proliferation and cytokine production (11) (12) (13) (14) . Previous studies have shown that lncRNAs 50 exert their roles in regulating chromatin accessibility, mRNA stability and protein activity by 51 interacting with chromatin DNA, mRNAs or proteins (15-18). With the discovery and 52 characterization of an increasing number of lncRNAs, several mechanisms of these lncRNAs 53 in virus-host interactions have been elucidated (19, 20) , however, many others remain 54 uncharacterized. recovery-stage counterparts (FC>2, p<0.05) and subjected them to a cluster analysis ( Fig 1B) . 100 To investigate the association between lncRNAs and IAV infection, in silico analysis 101 identified 26 novel lncRNAs candidates with notably aberrant expression (Fig 1C) . To 102 confirm the expression of these lncRNAs, we separated the neutrophils and monocytes from 103 healthy volunteers and infected the cells with influenza virus A/Beijing/501/2009 (abbreviated 104 as IAV-BJ501 or BJ501) for 12 h and found that XLOC_040025 (AVAN) was most 105 significantly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig 1D, E) . We also infected human 106 alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with IAV-BJ501 and measured the expression of the 26 lncRNAs and found that AVAN was most strongly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig   108   1F ). 109 110 AVAN is preferentially up-regulated following virus infection 111 We then performed qRT-PCR to quantify AVAN expression in the RNA-Seq samples and 112 found that the results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data ( Fig S2A) . Thus, AVAN was 113 chosen for subsequent investigation. To further confirm the expression of AVAN in 114 IAV-infected patients, we collected blood samples from 63 additional IAV-positive patients 115 and measured the expression of AVAN, which was significantly up-regulated in the neutrophils 116 of these patients (Fig 2A; Table S1 ). Similarly, AVAN was up-regulated in A549 cells after 117 infection with multiple sub-strains of IAV ( Fig 2B) and several other RNA viruses, including 118 Sendai virus (SeV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ， but not the DNA virus, adenovirus 119 (ADV) (Fig S2B) . In addition, Poly (I:C), IFN-β also could significantly stimulate the 120 expression of AVAN ( Fig S2B) . Moreover, AVAN expression was significantly up-regulated 121 upon IAV-BJ501 challenge in a time-and dose-dependent manner in A549 cells (Fig 2C, D) . 122 Absolute copy number measurement showed that AVAN was expressed at relatively low 123 levels without infection, with 11 or 14 transcript copies in per neutrophil or A549 cell 124 respectively ( Figure S2 ). Additionally, AVAN expression was also significantly up-regulated in 125 a time-and dose-dependent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60), 126 which is often a substitute for neutrophils, upon IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig S2B, C) . 127 Subcellular fractionation followed by qRT-PCR in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells revealed labeling-probes was weaken (Fig S2E) . AVAN exhibits no protein-coding potential according 135 to ORF finder (33) and the coding potential calculator (34) (Fig S2F) . Only one transcript 136 variant (approximately 500 nt) of AVAN was found in A549 cells, and it was found to be 137 up-regulated upon IAV-BJ501 infection using northern blot analysis ( Fig 2G) . The exact 138 transcript length (517 nt) of AVAN was confirmed by 5' and 3' RACE (Table S2) , which 139 revealed that AVAN is polyadenylated (Fig S2G) . Taken together, lncRNA expression profiling Table S3 -S8), suggesting that AVAN participates in innate antiviral immunity. To 149 identify the functions of AVAN, we generated AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells ( Fig 3A) and 150 found that viral replication was strongly inhibited (Fig 3B) . In contrast, virus titer was up-regulated following AVAN knockdown with two specific siRNAs (Fig 3H, I (Fig 3C) . To confirm this result, we performed ELISA to measure IFN-α and IFN-β protein 160 expression and found that IFN-α and IFN-β were strongly up-regulated in 161 AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells during IAV-BJ501 infection ( Fig 3D) . Conversely, these 162 phenomena were abolished by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3J, K) . 163 The above GSEA data and GO analysis showed that the genes related to AVAN were also 164 significantly enriched in chemotaxis and immune cell activation (Fig S4A, Table S9 , S10), the 165 main components of innate immune responses. To explore the role of AVAN in chemotaxis, we 166 collected culture supernatants of AVAN-overexpressing A549cells and performed neutrophil 167 transwell assays, which revealed that AVAN overexpression significantly up-regulated 168 neutrophil chemotaxis during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 3E) . These phenomena were disrupted 169 by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3L) .

Insights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Defining Immune Determinants for Vaccine Development,"Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.",.

However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro.

"Lessons learnt from 288 COVID-19 international cases: importations over time, effect of interventions, underdetection of imported cases","288 cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.","Twenty-six countries worldwide have declared cases of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, as of February 20, 2020 1 .

The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control,"The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.","The Influenza pandemic of 1918 was one of the deadliest epidemics of infectious disease the world has ever seen. In response, many cities introduced widespread interventions intended to reduce the spread. There is evidence [3] that those cities which implemented these interventions later had fewer deaths. This seemingly counter-intuitive observation suggests that those cities which were slow to respond were the most successful."
The impact of regular school closure on seasonal influenza epidemics: a data-driven spatial transmission model for Belgium,"School closure is often considered as an option to mitigate influenza epidemics because of its potential to reduce transmission in children and then in the community. The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified. We introduced a stochastic spatial age-specific metapopulation model to assess the role of holiday-associated behavioral changes and how","they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact."
,"The outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed that 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins.

Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins.

Spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation: An overview,"An emerging disease is one infectious epidemic caused by a newly transmissible pathogen, which has either appeared for the first time or already existed in human populations, having the capacity to increase rapidly in incidence as well as geographic range. Adapting to human immune system, emerging diseases may trigger large-scale pandemic spreading, such as the transnational spreading of SARS, the global outbreak of A(H1N1), and the recent potential invasion of avian influenza A(H7N9). To study the dynamics mediating the transmission of emerging diseases, spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation provides a valuable modeling framework, which takes spatially distributed factors into consideration. This review elaborates the latest progresses on the spatial metapopulation dynamics, discusses empirical and theoretical findings that verify the validity of networked metapopulations, and the application in evaluating the effectiveness of disease intervention strategies as well.","The term metapopulation was coined by Levins [1] in 1969 to describe a population dynamics model of insect pests in farmlands, yet the perspective has been broadly applied to study the effect of spatially distributed factors on evolutionary dynamics [2] , including genetic drift, pattern formation, extinction and recolonization, etc. The development of metapopulation theory, in conjunction with the fast development of complex networks theory, lead to the innovative application of the networked metapopulation in modeling largescale spatial transmission of emerging diseases. This interdisciplinary research field has attracted much attention by the scientific communities from diverse disciplines, such as public health, mathematical biology, statistical physics, information science, sociology, and complexity science. New insights are contributed to understanding the spatial dynamics of epidemic spreading, which provides valuable support to public healthcare."
Seattle Flu Study -Swab and Send: Study Protocol for At-Home Surveillance Methods to Estimate the Burden of Respiratory Pathogens on a City-Wide Scale,"While seasonal influenza and other respiratory pathogens cause significant morbidity and mortality each year, the community-based burden of these infections remains incompletely understood. Understanding the prevalence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of respiratory pathogen infections among community-dwelling individuals is essential during pandemic and epidemic settings and for developing pandemic-preparedness infrastructure.","Acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) pose a significant burden on the healthcare system in the United States and represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] . In the United States, influenza is estimated to cause 9-45 million illnesses 140,000-810,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000-67,000 deaths while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is estimated to cause 2 million outpatient visits each year in children under the age of 5 [5, 6] . Despite this burden, estimates about prevalence of the pathogens that result in ARIs rely on in-person healthcare visits or on aggregate counts from hospitalized individuals [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Additionally, these estimates generally capture illnesses when specific symptoms are present, such as fever, cough, or sore throat. Thus, they are likely a poor proxy for the prevalence of illness in community-dwelling individuals who may not necessarily seek care for their illness or have symptoms that fall outside of these criteria."
,"The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.",control strategies. The outbreak patterns in these provinces thus may provide crucial information for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries.
Carbon Nanocarriers Deliver siRNA to Intact Plant Cells for Efficient Gene,"Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a powerful tool to understand and control plant metabolic pathways, which is central to plant biotechnology. PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotubeinduced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery to intact cells. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.","siRNA without relying on plant transformation, however, most viruses are limited in their host range (13) , often do not result in uniform silencing of the gene, and thus levels of silencing can vary between plants and experiments (14) , and might inadvertently result in the suppression of non-target genes. Agrobacterium-mediated delivery, similarly, is also limited to use in certain plant species, often yields random DNA integration that can adversely and unpredictably affect the cell operation (15) , results in constitutive expression of siRNA thus limiting temporal control over gene silencing, and can be difficult to scale or multiplex for high-throughput or multi-gene target applications, respectively (16) ."
Predictions for the binding domain and potential new drug targets of 2019-nCoV,"An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.","In the past of 18 years, many researchers have done lots of work on etiology mechanism related to SARS, and Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) was confirmed to be a key for entering human cell by binding with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 1 ."
"Ministry of Health, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo g. School of Public Health","Background: As of May 27, 2018, 54 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the current outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use.","The factors causing epidemic growth to peak are debated. Delayed detection and resulting widespread distributions of EVD have significantly contributed to epidemic growth. 9 Containment strategies which prioritize isolation over care can be counterproductive by discouraging sick individuals from presenting to high-mortality Ebola units. [10] [11] [12] Unreported cases occurred at higher rates during the early period of the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak, 13 and urban transmission may also occur at a higher rate than rural transmission. 14 Change to subcritical transmission (reproduction number below 1) tends to occur when Ebola response organizations deploy control, prevention and care measures, 15, 16 communities adopt more protective behaviors, 17, 18 and/or transmission decreases in a social network. 19, 20 In the current Ebola outbreak in DRC, scientific advances with rapid diagnostics and vaccines from the West Africa outbreak has the potential to limit Ebola virus transmission as they are being deployed. [21] [22] [23] We used reported case counts from the current outbreak and/or time series from 18 prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without the use of vaccines. These projections are intended to help organizations anticipate and allocate sufficient resources to the 2018 Ebola outbreak in DRC."
A deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19),"To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease , screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority.","The outbreak of atypical and person-to-person transmissible pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2, also known as 2019-nCov) has caused a global alarm. There have been more than 100,000 confirmed cases of the Corona Virus Disease in the world, as of May 8, 2020 . According to the WHO, 16-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill with a 2-3% mortality rate. With the most recent estimated viral reproduction number (R0), the average number of other people that an infected individual will transmit the virus to in a completely non-immune population, stands at about 3.77 [1] , indicating that a rapid spread of the disease is imminent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify infected individuals as early as possible for quarantine and treatment procedures."
Kinetic Analysis of Bacteriophage Sf6 Binding to Outer Membrane Protein A Using Whole Virions,"For successful infection, viruses must recognize their respective host cells. A common mechanism of host recognition by viruses is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor.","Virtually all viruses must translocate their genetic information into their respective host cells and replicate via the host cell machinery to produce progeny [1] . dsDNA bacteriophages, which infect bacteria, are the most abundant viruses in the biosphere, with a global population estimated to be greater than 10 30 [2] . The molecular mechanisms that govern bacteriophage attachment to their hosts are not completely understood. Host recognition must be well coordinated by the virus in order to ensure fitness and progeny formation, as premature genome ejection does not result in a successful infection. One common mechanism bacteriophages employ is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor [3] , and this can be through interactions with surface glycans, proteins, or both."
Lymphopenia predicts disease severity of COVID-19: a descriptive and predictive study Summary Background,Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Geometric coupling of helicoidal ramps and curvature-inducing proteins in organelle membranes,"Cellular membranes display an incredibly diverse range of shapes, both in the plasma membrane and at membrane bound organelles. These morphologies are intricately related to cellular functions, enabling and regulating fundamental membrane processes. However, the biophysical mechanisms at the origin of these complex geometries are not fully understood from the standpoint of membrane-protein coupling. In this work, we focused on a minimal model of helicoidal ramps representative of specialized endoplasmic reticulum compartments. Given a helicoidal membrane geometry, we asked what is the distribution of spontaneous curvature required to maintain this shape at mechanical equilibrium? Based on the Helfrich energy of elastic membranes with spontaneous curvature, we derived the shape equation for minimal surfaces, and applied it to helicoids. We showed the existence of switches in the sign of the spontaneous curvature associated with geometric variations of the membrane structures. Furthermore, for a prescribed gradient of spontaneous curvature along the exterior boundaries, we identified configurations of the helicoidal ramps that are confined between two infinitely large energy barriers. Overall our results suggest possible mechanisms for geometric control of helicoidal ramps in membrane organelles based on curvatureinducing proteins.","Recent advances in microscopy, segmentation, and reconstruction methods have enabled us to visualize the plasma membrane and intracellular organelle membranes with a previously unforeseen level of spatial resolution [1] [2] [3] [4] . These observations demonstrate the stunning complexity of membrane architecture within cells. Remarkably, despite this diversity, some common geometrical features are found across organelles and functions [5] . For instance budding/necking processes occur in the plasma membrane through a variety of endocytic and exocytic mechanisms (e.g., clathrin mediated [6] [7] [8] , ESCRT [9] [10] [11] , antimicrobial peptides [12, 13] ), but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi in anterograde and retrograde trafficking [14, 15] . Similarly membrane tubes are present in the ER membrane network [1, [16] [17] [18] , mitochondria [19] [20] [21] , and in the form of cellular nanotubes [22] [23] [24] . Common to these seemingly disparate membrane structures is the catenoid-like geometry appearing at the neck of buds and the base of tubes [25] . Another striking example is the recently identified helicoidal structure connecting membrane sheets in the peripheral ER of neural and secretory cells [1, 26] as well as in the spine apparatus present in dendritic spines [4] (see Fig. 1 ). The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which these helicoidal membrane geometries are produced and maintained remain under active investigation. However, the conserved features of membrane shapes across different cellular locations and biological functions suggest the possible existence of common design principles relating lipid membrane geometry, composition, and function [5] ."
Emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and nursing college students during COVID-19 outbreak,"December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies.","In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 on people's emotions, people's coping strategies will also change as a result. Coping is the thoughts and actions that individuals use to deal with stressful events [11] . People have identified two general coping strategies: one is a problem-focused coping, the purpose is to solve the problem or take action to change the status quo; the other is an emotion-focused coping, which aims to reduce the emotional distress associated with stressful situations [12] . Studies have found that emotions lead to specific coping strategies [13] , and vice versa. Emotions are thought to have motivational properties that motivate certain behaviors or behaviors [13, 14] . For example, fear is related to the desire to evade and protect themselves from incidents, anger leads to desire to attack, disgust leads to desire to expel, and happiness leads to desire to entertain [13, 15] ."
Planning horizon affects prophylactic decision-making and epidemic dynamics,"Human behavior can change the spread of infectious disease. There is limited understanding of 1 how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning 2 horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE 3 analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic 4 behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence 5 with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long 6 planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, 7 individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such 8 adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, 9 depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of 10 prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially 11 generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the 12 behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual's perceived risk of infection.","Introduction infected (e.g. wearing a mask, washing hands, etc.). Agents in the infectious state I are infected 73 and infective, while those in the recovered state R are immune to and do not transmit disease. 74 The transition between states is captured with the state-transition diagram shown in Fig. 1 . For 75 reference, all the parameters and variables in the SPIR model are listed and defined in Table 1 . S, P, I, and R represent the four epidemiological states an agent can be in: Susceptible, Prophylactic, Infectious, and Recovered, respectively. The parameters over the transitions connecting the states represent the probability per time step that agents in one state move to an adjacent state: i is the proportion of infectious agents in the population; bS and bP are the respective probabilities that an agent in state S or P, encountering an infectious agent I, becomes infected; g is the recovery probability; d is the behavioral decision making probability; and W(i) is an indicator function returning value 1 when the utility of being prophylactic is greater than the utility of being susceptible and 0 otherwise (see details in Behavioral Decision Model). This sub-model assumes that in each time step, three types of events occur: (i) interactions Proportion of susceptible agents in the population. p"
"Title: Risk of disease spillover from dogs to wild carnivores in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India. Running head: Disease spillover from dogs to carnivores","Many mammalian carnivore species have been reduced to small, isolated populations by habitat destruction, fragmentation, poaching, and human conflict. Their limited genetic variability and increased exposure to domestic animals such as dogs place them at risk of further losses from infectious diseases. In India, domestic and feral dogs are associated with villages in and around protected areas, and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens to the carnivores within. India's Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) is home to a number of threatened and endangered mammalian carnivores including tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), wolf (Canis lupus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). It also has more than 150 villages with associated dog populations. We found that dog populations ranged from 14 to 45/village (3.7 to 23.7/km 2 ), and did not vary with village area, human population size, or distance from the KTR's core area, though they all increased between summer 2014 and winter 2015, primarily through reproduction. No dog tested positive for rabies but seroprevalence levels to three other generalist viral pathogens were high in summer (N=67) and decreased somewhat by winter (N=168): canine parvovirus (83.6% to 68.4%), canine distemper virus (50.7% to 30.4%) and canine adenovirus (41.8% to 30.9%).","approximately 150 villages in the buffer zone (1,134 km 2 ), where regulated human activities are 25 allowed, and eight villages in the core zone ('core') (940 km 2 ), where stricter regulations on 26 human activity are implemented. All these villages support dog populations (DeFries, Karanth & 27 Pareeth, 2010) . In India, dogs near protected areas threaten wild animals through predation and 28 competition (Home, Bhatnagar & Vanak, 2017) ; and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens that 29 threaten wild carnivores. Majority of dogs in KTR are semi-owned and associate with household 30 but are unrestrained. A few are owned and restrained, and the rest are feral. No village dogs were 31 vaccinated (V. C. pers. comm. with park authorities and owners) so they pose a potential disease 32 spillover risk to carnivores. 33"
Enabling large-scale genome editing by reducing DNA nicking,"To extend the frontier of genome editing and enable the radical redesign of mammalian genomes, we developed a set of dead-Cas9 base editor (dBE) variants that allow editing at tens of thousands of loci per cell by overcoming the cell death associated with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs). We used a set of gRNAs targeting repetitive elementsranging in target copy number from about 31 to 124,000 per cell. dBEs enabled survival after 5 large-scale base editing, allowing targeted mutations at up to ~13,200 and ~2610 loci in 293T and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), respectively, three orders of magnitude greater than previously recorded. These dBEs can overcome current on-target mutation and toxicity barriers that prevent cell survival after large-scale genome engineering.","To achieve similar efficiencies to native Cas9 all base editor generations beyond the first are nBEs. As a result, base editing has been broadly demonstrated with high efficiency in a range of species including human zygotes(21). A main motivation for developing BEs that avoid DSBs was to reduce the level of random vs. user-specified mutations caused by ""live"" Cas9, but the 3 in sensitive cell types such as hiPSCs (22) . However, whether these BEs can enable concurrent editing in human cells of sites as numerous as high copy TEs has not been explored but is particularly relevant to genome wide recoding efforts such as genome project write(23) (GP-write). To recode the human genome would require an estimated 4438 to 9811 precise modifications to remove all instances of one of the three stop codons(24). 5 "
China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model,"The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all","Coronaviruses (CoVs), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, are positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses and cause infections in birds, mammals, and humans (1) (2) (3) . The family includes four genera, such as Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (4) . Two infamous infectious coronaviruses in the genus Betacoronavirus are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (5) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (6) , which have infected more than 10,000 people around the world in the past two decades. Unfortunately, the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates (9.6% for SARS-CoV and 34.4% for MERS-CoV), indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread (7, 8) . However, this cannot be achieved with current drug development or an application system, taking several years for newly developed drugs to come to the market."
BAR scaffolds drive membrane fission by crowding disordered domains,"Cylindrical protein scaffolds are thought to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing membrane fission. In contrast, Snead et al. find that when scaffold proteins assemble, bulky disordered domains within them become acutely concentrated, generating steric pressure that destabilizes tubules, driving fission.","Cellular membranes must undergo dynamic remodeling to facilitate essential cellular processes including formation of trafficking vesicles (Conner and Schmid, 2003) , viral egress (Hurley et al., 2010) , and cytokinesis (Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014) . Since membranes resist deformation (Helfrich, 1973) , cells employ specialized protein machines to drive membrane remodeling (Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006) . For example, the crescent-shaped, dimeric bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains Simunovic et al., 2015) polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces, forcing the underlying membrane to adopt the tubular geometry of the scaffold (Adam et al., 2015; Frost et al., 2008; . This rigid scaffold is thought to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing their division into separate membrane compartments through the process of membrane fission (Boucrot et al., 2012) ."
An epidemiological forecast model and software assessing interventions on COVID-19 epidemic in China,"We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease or COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, spreads out quickly in Hubei and then in China, South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy, as well as many other cities across the world.

Spreading predictability in complex networks,"Spreading dynamics analysis is an important and interesting topic since it has many applications such as rumor or disease controlling, viral marketing and information recommending. Many state-of-the-art researches focus on predicting infection scale or threshold. Few researchers pay attention to the predicting of infection nodes from a snapshot. With developing of precision marketing, recommending and, controlling, how to predict infection nodes precisely from snapshot becomes a key issue in spreading dynamics analysis. In this paper, a probability based prediction model is presented so as to estimate the infection nodes from a snapshot of spreading. Experimental results on synthetic and real networks demonstrate that the model proposed could predict the infection nodes precisely in the sense of probability.","Spreading dynamics is an important issue in spreading and controlling [1] [2] [3] of 2 rumor [4] [5] [6] [7] and disease [8] [9] [10] [11] , marketing [12] , recommending [13] [14] [15] , source 3 detecting [16, 17] , and many other interesting topics [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .

Funk et al [29] presented a stochastic semi-mechanistic 18 model of infectious disease dynamics that was used in real time during the 2013-2016 19 West African Ebola epidemic to fit the simulated trajectories in the Ebola Forecasting 20 Challenge, and to produce forecasts that were compared to following data points. 21 Venkatramanan et al [30] proposed a data-driven agent-based model framework for 22 forecasting the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, and subsequently used during 23 the Ebola forecasting challenge. The data-driven approach can be refined and adapted 24 for future epidemics, and share the lessons learned over the course of the challenge. 25 Zhang et al [31] proposed a measurement to state the efforts of users on Twitter to get 26 their information spreading. They found that small fraction of users with special 27 performance on participation can gain great influence, while most other users play a 28 role as middleware during the information propagation. 29 Up to now, most researches are focused on macro level of spreading prediction, but 30 few on micro level. However, the detailed infected individuals should be known so as 31 to contain the spread of serious infectious diseases such as SARS [32, 33] and 32 H7N7 [34, 35] . Besides aspect of macro level of spreading, we should pay attention to 33 some more details besides the general infection coverage so as to achieve fine 34 prediction. Chen et al. did some interesting works on this area [23] . They presented 35 an iterative algorithm to estimate the infection probability of the spreading process 36 and then apply it to mean-field approach to predict the spreading coverage. 37 Combing mean-field or pair approximation models with infection probability 38 estimating strategy [23] , the number of infected nodes from a given snapshot of the 39 propagation on network can be predicted, but can not determine which nodes will be 40 infected. In this paper, we present a probability based prediction model to estimate 41 the infection probability of a node, further, to determine the nodes being infected in 42 the future. 44 For a given snapshot, a susceptible node can be infected by a probability in the future. 45 Denoting by P u (t) the score of node u at time t, we have,"
A B,"The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the PBM (SB203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","The current epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) with disruptive health, social and economic repercussions. Three major actions, confinement, detection and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17 December, 2019 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation and structural modelling can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment."

According to ""The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)"" issued by National Health and Commission of China and ""The Experts' Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV"" released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56 o C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 o C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 o C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank's solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 o C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.

Similar ratios of introns to intergenic sequence across animal 1 genomes,"One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between 12 organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically 13 dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are 14 usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across 12 animal 15 phyla and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome composition and transcription, taking 16 into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, the ratio of introns to 17 intergenic sequence is comparable across essentially all animals, with nearly all deviations dominated by 18 increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that 19 the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit 20 substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our 21 results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences 22 in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more 23 dependent on genome size than previously thought. 24 33 34","Understanding why genomes vary greatly in size and how organisms make different use their genomes have 26 been central questions in biology for decades [1] . For many bacteria, the majority of the genome is composed 27 of relatively short genes, averaging around 1000bp, and coding for proteins. Indeed, the largest bacterial 28 genome (a myxobacterium) that has been sequenced is only 14 megabases, containing an estimated 11,500 29 genes [2]. However, for eukaryotic organisms, genomes can be over ten-thousand-fold larger than bacterial 30 genomes due to an increase in the number of genes (tens of thousands compared to a few thousand in most 31 bacteria), expansion of the genes themselves due to the addition of introns, and expansion of the sequence 32 between genes. accessions SRR922615 and SRR1024340, derived from whole adult animals. For the lamprey P. marinus, we were unable to find any annotation as GFF or GTF, so we generated including three model organisms (human, mouse, dog), opossum and platypus (for the non-eutherian clades, 217 marsupial and monotreme, respectively) and the chimp, to compare directly to the human annotation. In 218 general, parasites were excluded because they often have unusual biology, such as the single-celled eukaryote 219 T. brucei, which is known for its unusual RNA processing [79, 80] . Generally, we refer to small and large genomes as those below and above 500Mb, respectively. The small-222 est animal genome used in this study is that of the larvacean Oikopleura dioica (70Mb), while the largest is EST training, several different results are expected: some genes are split because internal exons are not require evidence from ESTs or transcriptome sequencing for accurate predictions, and this has implications 244 for our measurements of total exons in each genome. This means that even in a ""perfect"" genome where 245 all coding genes are correctly predicted by an annotation program (perhaps based on similarity to a related 246 species) that the precise positions and amount of UTR may still be unknown, resulting in an underestimation 247 of the amount of exonic sequence (Fig 1A and B) . Because of this, the reliance on coding genes is likely to 248 underestimate the usable fraction of the genome."

TITLE: Isolation and sequencing of AGO-bound RNAs reveals characteristics of mammalian stem-loop processing in vivo AUTHORS,"MicroRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are short hairpin RNAs that are rapidly processed into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cytoplasm. Due to their low abundance in cells, sequencing-based studies of pre-miRNAs have been limited. We successfully enriched for and deep sequenced pre-miRNAs in human cells by capturing these RNAs during their interaction with Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Using this approach, we detected > 350 pre-miRNAs in human cells and > 250 pre-miRNAs in a reanalysis of a similar study in mouse cells. We uncovered widespread trimming and non-templated additions to the 3' ends of pre-and mature miRNAs. Additionally, we created an index for microRNA precursor processing efficiency. This analysis revealed a subset of pre-miRNAs that produce low levels of mature miRNAs despite abundant precursors, including an annotated miRNA in the 5' UTR of the DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 mRNA transcript. This led us to search for AGO-associated stem-loops originating from other mRNA species, which identified hundreds of putative pre-miRNAs derived from human and mouse mRNAs. In summary, we provide a wealth of information on mammalian pre-miRNAs, and identify novel microRNA and microRNA-like elements localized in mRNAs.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs (smRNAs) that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by repressing translation and/or promoting degradation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (1,2). Animal miRNAs are generated in a two-step process, whereby miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are first cleaved from their primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by the action of the DGCR8/DROSHA microprocessor complex (3, 4) . Alternative pre-miRNA biogenesis pathways have been described that bypass the microprocessor. For example, mirtron loci generate pre-miRNAs in a splicing-dependent and DROSHA-independent fashion (5, 6) . Pre-miRNAs are then transported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 for further processing (7, 8) ."
Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.","In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. 1 It has since spread globally, reaching more than three dozen countries with over 80,000 confirmed cases by late February. 2 To reduce further spread of the disease, governments have implemented community measures to increase social distancing for those at highest risk of infection. 3 In China, policies include unprecedented lockdowns to reduce contacts between individuals, travel restrictions, and door-to-door temperature checks with mandatory mass quarantine. 4 Contact tracing, a core strategy to control disease, is used to identify individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease and to focus interventions on this high risk group. If identified contacts are symptomatic when found, they are promptly isolated and treated in a healthcare setting. More often, contacts are found healthy, and may or may not be infected. Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period. How to handle these symptom-free contacts is a recurring point of confusion and controversy, particularly for emerging infectious diseases. Two essential strategies are used: individual quarantine and active monitoring. Individual quarantine involves the separation from others of an individual who is believed to be exposed to the disease, but not currently showing symptoms of it. A less restrictive intervention, active monitoring, involves assessing the individual for symptoms at regular intervals and, if symptoms are detected, promptly isolating the individual."
,"Early in planta detection of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae in pomegranate using 2 enhanced loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay 3 4 Abstract 33 Bacterial blight in pomegranate caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae (Xap) is an 34 increasing threat for pomegranate cultivation in India. To prevent the economic losses, it is pivotal 35 to detect the infection in latent stages rather than in later stages. We have developed an enhanced 36 method termed as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to evaluate for the 37 latent detection of Xap in pomegranate using six set of specific primers. Three DNA intercalating 38 dyes were used, such as Ethidium bromide, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and SYBR Green which 39 resulted in visualising the positivity for LAMP assay. The reaction time and temperature were to 40 be 65°C from 30 min onwards, for the dyes and its sensitivity was observed up to 10 -7 ng in the 41 LAMP assay. For field applicability, LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day post infection while the 42 PCR amplified Xap after 11 th day post infection. Finally, the specificity of LAMP assay was 43 validated to be positive with ten Xap isolates for its accuracy and 29 non-Xap bacterial isolates 44 showed negative results. Moreover, this method could be used as a better alternative to PCR based 45 methods, for early detection of the pathogens. 46 47 50 Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an important fruit crop widely cultivated from tropical to 51 temperate conditions [1]. India ranks first in the world for maximum area under pomegranate 52 cultivation (0.125 million hectares) and Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the major 53 pomegranate growing states [2]. The bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. 54 punicae (Xap) in pomegranate was first reported in India in 1952 and presently it has a serious 55 outbreak in all major pomegranate-growing states resulting in a major economic loss. Prominent 56 small water-soaked and dark irregular spots appearing on the leaf are the typical symptoms induced 57 by this pathogen. The pathogen infect the fruit, stem, branches causing cracking symptoms and 58 ultimately leads to yield loss up to 80 percent [3]. .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/328674 doi: bioRxiv preprint 59 Globally, it is estimated that a minimum 30-40% of the crop cultivated gets destroyed 60 annually due to pests and diseases [4]. In India, bacterial blight alone reduces the yield between 61 60 to 80 percent above global yield loss in pomegranate. To avoid yield loss, it is very important 62 and necessary to develop an efficiently sensitive pathogen detection method within incubation time 63 of the pathogen (i.e. time between the host infection and expression of the disease symptoms) 64 [5,6]. 65 The most common methods employed for detecting the plant pathogens include 66 immunological techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [7] and molecular 67 methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [8] and Southern blotting [9]. The methods for 68 early detection of the plant pathogens in the field has to be designed in such a way that it has to be 69 competently very sensitive, specific, cost-effective and detectable with a minimal equipment 70 facilities [10]. For instance, the PCR based technique has its own drawbacks which require high 71 quality and quantity of DNA and amplification is complex that requires a thermal cycler for 72 changing the reaction temperature and requires relatively long time for the amplification process 73 to complete. Further, it also requires agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation to confirm 74 the amplification [11]. To overcome these limitations, researchers have shown interest in 75 developing an isothermal amplification technique termed as Loop-mediated isothermal 76 amplification (LAMP) [12]. LAMP is an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis 77 technique, which is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require a thermal-cycler. 78 The amplification is completed within 30-60 minutes at a constant temperature of 60-65º C, which 79 can be carried out in a simple water bath or heating block [13]. Moreover, LAMP is a cost effective 80 and it does not require a thermal cycler and electrophoretic unit, as the result can be inferred as 81 positive or negative with the colour change or turbidity observed by naked eye without spending 82 much time [14]. 83 The favorable target for bacterial pathogen diagnostic includes mainly, 16S ribosomal 84 RNA (rRNA) gene which is been widely used to identify the bacterial species among different 85 bacteria [15-17]. This diversity is unique for species and their sequences are presented inside their 86 nine (V1 -V9) hypervariable regions which constitutes useful targets [18]. These regions are 87 highly conserved stretches in bacteria, which facilitates the identification through PCR In principle, the LAMP assay recognizes six specifically designed primers that recognize 90 eight distinct sequences from the target bacterial DNA [20]. It consists of two outer primers (F3 91 and B3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP), a loop-forward (LF) and a loop-backward (LB). These 92 six primers ensure a high specificity for target DNA amplification. Moreover, these primers enable 93 generation of a stem-loop DNA for subsequent complex LAMP amplification, which includes self-94 priming reaction. A mixture of DNA, differing in the number of loops and length of the stem-loop 95 is produced as a final product [21]. By considering the advantages of LAMP assay, which is widely 96 used to detect broad range of microorganisms[22,23]. The present study was aimed to detect the 97 bacterial blight of pomegranate in early stages with minimum pathogen DNA template by 98 optimizing several DNA intercalating dyes with lower temperature in a shorter time with less 99 technical skills.","intercalating dyes.

Freshwater monitoring by nanopore sequencing,"Clean freshwater lies at the heart of human society and monitoring its quality is paramount. In addition to chemical controls, traditional microbiological water tests focus on the detection of specific bacterial pathogens. The direct tracing of all aquatic DNA poses a more profound alternative. Yet, this has hitherto been underused due to challenges in cost and logistics. Here we present a simple, fast, inexpensive and comprehensive freshwater diagnostics workflow centred around portable nanopore DNA sequencing. Using defined bacterial compositions and spatiotemporal microbiota from surface water of an example river in Cambridge (UK), our study shows how nanopore sequencing can be readily integrated for the assessment of aquatic bacterial diversity and pollution. We provide a computational benchmark that features more than ten taxonomic classification tools to derive guidelines for bacterial DNA analyses with nanopore data. Through complementary physicochemical measurements, we find that nanopore metagenomics can depict fine temporal gradients along the main hydrological axis of an urban-rural interface and yield high-resolution pathogen maps that address concerns of public health.","The global assurance of safe drinking water and basic sanitation has been recognised as a United Nations Millennium Development Goal 1 , particularly in light of the pressures of rising urbanisation, agricultural intensification and climate change 2,3 .

During the 2019-nCoV's infection of host cells, a critical virion protein is the Spike surface glycoprotein, also known as the S protein. Spike proteins constitute the outermost component in a coronavirus virion particle and are responsible for viral recognition of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane receptor on mammalian hosts that facilitate viral entrance into host cells [1] [2] . Therefore, the spike protein largely determines host specificity and infectivity of a coronavirus. In this report, we re-analyzed two recent studies [3] [4] , which have spurred numerous interests and discussions in the community and the society, regarding the sequence and structure of spike protein in the 2019-nCoV and the identification of its intermediate hosts."

Reconciling early-outbreak estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.","Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading in China and other parts of the world (World Health Organization, 2020d).

How to make more from exposure data? An integrated machine Author Contributions Data Accessibility Statement Running Title Machine learning and pathogen exposure risk,"1. Predicting infectious disease dynamics is a central challenge in disease ecology. Models 36 that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only 37 provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide 38 management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, 39 however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data is available on a subset 40 of individuals and non-linear relationships between variables are common. 41 42 2.

Our 45 approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to 46 find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better 47 interpret results.

A planarian nidovirus expands the limits of RNA genome size Significance Statement,"RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication (albeit within a permissive environment). A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts.

The feasibility of an autonomous ancient RNA genome and the mechanisms underlying such fateful transitions are challenging to reconstruct. It is especially unclear whether such RNA entities ever evolved genomes close to the 100-300 kilobases (kb) range (2, 3) of the ""minimal"" reconstructed cellular DNA genome (4) . This range overlaps with the upper size limit of nuclear pre-mRNAs (5) ; however, pre-mRNAs are incapable of self-replication, the defining property of primordial genomic RNAs."
Trends in Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan and 29 Provinces in China,"Background The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID-19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.","1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which became stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan."
Crystal structure of the giant panda MHC class I complex: first insights into the viral 1 peptide presentation profile in the bear family 2,"The viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptides presented by classical MHC-I 13 molecules require the assembly of a peptide-MHC-I-β2m (aka pMHC-I) trimolecular complex 14 for TCR recognition, which is the critical activation link for triggering antiviral T cell immunity. 15 Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, research on T cell immunology in this family, 16 especially structural immunology, is lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular 17 complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved 18 for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural 19 characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the 20 peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others 21 in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. 22 Spriggs H, Dear PH, Briggs AW. 2008.

The 26 distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the 27 evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for 28 research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family. 29"
Beyond R 0 : the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics,"The basic reproductive number -R 0 -is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R 0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R 0 . Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R 0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R 0 ) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R 0 when predicting epidemic size.","The basic reproductive number -R 0 -is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health.

Influence of different glycoproteins and of the virion core on SERINC5 antiviral activity,"Host plasma membrane protein SERINC5 is incorporated into budding retrovirus particles where it blocks subsequent entry into susceptible target cells. Three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, HIV-1 Nef, EIAV S2, and MLV Glycogag, each independently disrupt SERINC5 antiviral activity, by redirecting SERINC5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal RAB7 + endosomal compartment. Pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV G), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated SERINC5. To better understand viral determinants for SERINC5-sensitivity, the effect of SERINC5 was assessed using HIV-1, MLV, and M-PMV virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from Arenavirus, Coronavirus, Filovirus, Rhabdovirus, Paramyxovirus, and Orthomyxovirus genera. Infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with HIV-1, amphotropic-MLV, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by SERINC5, whether the core was provided by HIV-1, MLV, or M-PMV. Particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-A, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), ecotropic-MLV, HTLV-1, Measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), or VSV, were insensitive to SERINC5. In contrast, particles pseudotyped with M-PMV, RD114, or rabies virus (RABV)","The importance of SERINC5 for inhibition of retroviruses is underscored by convergent evolution among three non-monophyletic retroviruses, each of which encodes a structurally unrelated SERINC5 inhibitor. One of these retroviruses causes tumors in mice, a second anemia in horses, and a third causes AIDS. SERINC5 is incorporated into retrovirus particles where it blocks entry into target cells, via a mechanism that is dependent on the viral glycoprotein. Here we demonstrate that retroviruses pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several non-retroviruses are also inhibited by SERINC5, suggesting that enveloped viruses other than retroviruses may also be inhibited by SERINC5. Additionally, we found that sensitivity to SERINC5 is determined by the retrovirus core, as well as by the glycoprotein. By better understanding how SERINC5 inhibits viruses we hope to extend fundamental understanding of virus replication and of the native role of SERINC5 in cells, and perhaps to advance the development of new antiviral strategies."
Establishment of primary transgenic human airway 1 epithelial cell cultures to study respiratory virus - 2 host interactions 3,"Primary human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures represent a universal platform to 20 propagate respiratory viruses and characterize their host interactions in authentic target cells. To 21 further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors 22 in airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification.","However, in order to fully utilize the potential of this culture system it must be made amenable to 66 genetic modification. Transgenesis would enable the study of viral and/or host factors important for 67 respiratory virus infections and allow for the elucidation of specific mechanism involved in virus-host 68 interactions by targeted gene knockdown or overexpression. However, using primary cells for genetic 69 modification is challenging since they have a finite life span in cell culture. Primary human bronchial 70 cells can only be limitedly passaged after isolation if differentiation capabilities are to be maintained 71 [16] . The incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 has been 72 shown to increase the number of passages primary cells can undergo in vitro without gross influence 73 on cell differentiation capacity [17, 18] . Theoretically, this would enable the generation of genetically 74 modified well-differentiated primary human airway epithelium in vitro."
Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model,"Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.","Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (designated 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China raised serious public health concerns and many human tragedies. To manage the epidemics resulting from virus spreading across China and other countries forecasting the occurrence of future cases is extremely important. Such forecasting is very complicated and uncertain since many factors are poorly understood or estimated with a large possible error. Two major factors include spatial movement of virus carriers (i.e., infected individuals) and the basic reproduction number R0 (average number of new infections originated from an infected individual)."
,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 . Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B 0 AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å in the presence of B 0 AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 Å, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor.","For background introduction to ACE2 and B 0 AT1, please refer to our recent posting on bioRxiv that reports the 2.9 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the full-length ACE2 in complex with B 0 AT1, assembled as a dimer of heterodimers (1) . The presence of B 0 AT1 appears to stabilize the overall conformation of the full-length human ACE2."
The geometry of dependence: solitary bee larvae prioritize carbohydrate over protein in,"1. Bees, important pollinators, have declined significantly in recent decades, and human-11 induced changes to nutritional landscapes are partly responsible. Changes to nutritional 12 quality rather than quantity have been overlooked as a threat to bee health. Yet 13 knowledge of bee nutrition is currently largely restricted to adults of social species. 14 Larval stages, where most growth occurs, are relatively understudied -perhaps because 15 most social bees provision progressively and collectively, making nutrition difficult to 16 trace. 17 2. In mass-provisioning solitary bees (Osmia bicornis L.), we can manipulate and follow 18 larval nutrition, and thereby determine effects of changes in diet quality. Under the 19 Geometric Framework for Nutrition, we restricted larvae to 6 diets: 3 20 protein:carbohydrate ratios and 2 nutrient concentrations. We asked: (a) which diets 21 maximise body size and survival, (b) what consumption rules do larvae follow when 22 nutrients are imbalanced? Finally, (c) given a choice of complementary diets, are larvae 23 able to select a dietary balance? 24 3. Larvae pupated after consuming a fixed carbohydrate amount, but tolerated a wide range 25 of protein. Body size and survival were maximised on our lowest P:C ratio diet, and 26","Bees are critical not only to global ecological stability but also to humans' food security, 44 as major pollinators for 90% of the world's food crops (Klein et al., 2018 (Klein et al., , 2007 Potts et al., 45 2016) and many wildflowers (Ollerton et al., 2011) . Many wild and domesticated bees have seen 46 marked declines in recent decades, with both significant range contractions and extinctions 47 maintain themselves (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012a) . Understanding how animals cope in a 66 changing nutritional environment requires us to understand not only how animals gather the 67 correct balance of nutrients they need, but also how they adjust their foraging when resources are 68 imbalanced (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012b) . 69 In bees, the larval stage is where almost all growth occurs (Nijhout et al., 2014) as well as distinctly different diet to adults, adults primarily feeding on nectar (although see Cane, 2016) 77 and larvae feeding almost solely on pollen (Muth et al., 2016) . 78 The Geometric Framework for Nutrition (GF) allows us to investigate foraging decisions 79 made by animals in multi-dimensional ""nutrient space"" (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012b, 80 1993). The GF can be used to determine an organism's intake target (the optimal amount and 81 balance of macronutrients that an animal should aim to consume in order to achieve maximal 82 fitness (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 1993) as well as how that target is achieved. Additionally, 83 we can use the GF to investigate the rule of compromise -that is, the rules governing 84 consumption that an animal uses when it is unable to reach its intake target with the nutritional 85 options available (e.g. Lee et al., 2004b; Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2001) . 86 The GF has provided profound insights into broad topics from ant agriculture (Shik et al., 87 2016) to human obesity (Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2005) .

Systematic Review of the Registered Clinical Trials of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19),"Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in Ⅲ stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 -328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 -363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials","This review presented a narrative synthesis. This study mainly analyzed and summarized the types of studies, intervention, host organization and address, sample size, research stage, research status, excepted completion time, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome measurement and observation time, methodology quality and describes the results with statistics and characteristics respectively.

G-quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of all known human viruses: a comprehensive guide Running title: Presence and conservation of G4s in human viruses,"G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of putative G-quadruplexes in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that the presence, distribution, and location of G-quadruplexes are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the G-quadruplex classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all G-quadruplexes formed by GG-, GGG-and GGGG-islands present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome along with the known function of that region, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each G-quadruplex in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of G-quadruplex formation. This information is accessible from a database","G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in singlestranded DNA and RNA G-rich sequences under physiological conditions (Lipps and Rhodes 2009 ). Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type base-pairing to yield G-quartets: stacking of at least two G-quartets leads to G4 formation, through π-π interactions between aromatic systems of G-quartets. K + cations in the central cavity relieve repulsion among oxygen atoms and specifically support G4 formation and stability (Sen and Gilbert 1990) . In the human genome, putative DNA G4 forming regions are clustered at definite genomic regions, such as telomeres, oncogene promoters, immunoglobulin switch regions, DNA replication origins and recombination sites (Maizels and Gray 2013) . Actual G4s were shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, and DNA recombination (Perrone et al. 2013a; Holder and Hartig 2014; Maizels 2015; Rhodes and Lipps 2015; Zhou et al. 2015) ."

Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staff Protection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 2 Outbreak,46,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019 has led to a serious public 69 health event [1] [2] [3] . Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed 70 unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of 71 medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the 72 hospital environment [4, 5] . Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene 73 to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 74 COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine 75 measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the 76 pandemic [6] . Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the 77 outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control 78 [5, 7] .

The RZZ complex integrates spindle checkpoint maintenance with dynamic expansion of unattached kinetochores,"The Mad1-Mad2 heterodimer is the catalytic hub of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which controls mitosis through assembly of a multi-subunit anaphase inhibitor, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) [1, 2] . Mad1-Mad2 first catalyzes MCC assembly at interphase nuclear pores [3] , then migrates to kinetochores at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and resumes MCC assembly until bipolar spindle attachment is complete [1, 2] . There is significant debate about the factor(s) involved in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores in higher eukaryotes [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Through gene editing and livecell imaging, we found that the human Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is dispensable for cell viability and initial recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores at NEBD, but then becomes necessary to tether Mad1-Mad2 at kinetochores and sustain SAC arrest in cells challenged with spindle poisons. We also show that RZZ forms the mesh-like fibrous corona, a structural expansion of the outer kinetochore important for timely chromosome congression [10-13] once Mps1 phosphorylates the N-terminus of Rod.","Basal mitotic timing was longer and more heterogeneous in RZZ-deficient cells ( Fig.   2A ), suggesting a delay in bipolar attachment and SAC satisfaction. Consistently, KNTC1-null cells rapidly exited mitosis when the SAC kinase Mps1 was inhibited with reversine ( Fig. 2A) . To monitor mitotic chromosome dynamics and SAC signaling, we expressed and imaged H2B-mCherry and FLAP-Mad1 using spinning disk confocal microscopy. At NEBD Mad1 immediately localized at nascent kinetochores, then dissociated as chromosomes congressed at the metaphase plate ( Fig. 2B ; n=10 cells). Congression was less efficient in KNTC-null cells, consistent with the lack of Spindly and dynein at kinetochores ( [17] and Fig. S2 ), with small numbers of Mad1positive chromosomes temporarily at the spindle poles ( Fig. 2C; n=14 cells) . We conclude that RZZ accelerates (but is not strictly required for) chromosome biorientation."
CORONAVIRUS IN PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY: RAPID REVIEW AND EXPERT CONSENSUS,"BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission.","METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv, see appendix for search strategies, to identify primary case reports, case series or randomised-controlled trial describing women of any age affected by coronavirus in pregnancy or the postnatal period.

Here, we report viral and bacterial community profiling of NP aspirates across a birth cohort, capturing all lower respiratory illnesses during their first year. Most infants were initially colonized with Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium before stable colonization with Alloiococcus or Moraxella, with transient incursions of Streptococcus, Moraxella or Haemophilus marking virus-associated ARIs. Our data identify the NP microbiome as a determinant for infection spread to the lower airways, severity of accompanying inflammatory symptoms, and risk for future asthma development. Early asymptomatic colonization with Streptococcus was a strong asthma predictor, and antibiotic usage disrupted asymptomatic colonization patterns. doi: bioRxiv preprint (154/782) of recorded episodes of upper respiratory illness (URI). The characteristics of the infants are summarized in Table S1 .","The microbial communities comprising the human microbiome are now recognised as playing important roles in the aetiology and pathogenesis of myriad diseases (1) . However elucidation of these complex roles requires targeted characterization of microbial communities present in relevant spatial niche(s) during critical periods of pathogenesis. The focus of this study is the respiratory tract, in particular the nasopharynx (NP) which is an accessible source of airway microbial communities (2) and serves as a conduit for pathogens associated with lower respiratory illnesses (LRI) that are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide."

Title: Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV.,"Evidence before this study Contact tracing and isolation of cases is a commonly used intervention for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. This intervention can be effective, but may require intensive public health effort and cooperation to effectively reach and monitor all contacts. When the pathogen has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging."
Kin and group selection are both flawed but useful data analysis tools,"For understanding the evolution of social behavior in microbes, mathematical theory can aid empirical research but is often only used as a qualitative heuristic. How to properly formulate social evolution theory has also been contentious. Here we evaluate kin and multilevel selection theory as tools for analyzing microbial data. We reanalyze published datasets that share a common exper-5 imental design and evaluate these theories in terms of data visualization, statistical performance, biological interpretation, and quantitative comparison across systems. We find that the canonical formulations of both kin and multilevel selection are almost always poor analytical tools because they use statistical regressions that are poorly specified for the strong selection and nonadditive fitness effects common in microbial systems. Analyzing both individual and group fitness outcomes 10 helps clarify the biology of selection. We also identify analytical practices in empirical research that suggest how theory might better handle the challenges of microbial data. A quantitative, data-driven approach thus shows how kin and multilevel selection theory both have substantial room for improvement as tools for understanding social evolution in all branches of life.","For biologists seeking to understand the evolution of cooperation and social behavior, mathematical theory has been a valuable guide for empirical research. Kin selection theory, for example, has been enormously influential in part because it shows that social evolution can be understood from just a few important quantities: how a behavior affects the fitness of an actor, how that behavior affects the fitness of other individuals, and the genetic relatedness between social partners [1, 2] . This theory 20 was developed with a major focus on animal behavior, so its mathematical form was developed in terms of the quantitative-genetic phenotypes most easily measured in animal systems [3] . Similarly, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models of kin selection were formulated to facilitate predictions and empirical tests using comparative data [4] with substantial success [5, 6, 7] ."
Trypsin treatment unlocks barrier for zoonotic coronaviruses infection. Running Title: Trypsin unlocks barrier for zoonotic CoV infection,"Traditionally, the emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) has been attributed to a gain in receptor 2 binding in a new host. Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already 3 harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that 4 additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming 5 host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that 6 the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate 7 infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show 8 that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human 9 lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike 10 does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike 11 receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera.","Since the beginning of the 21 st century, public health infrastructures have been required 28 to periodically respond to new and reemerging zoonotic viral diseases, including influenza, 29 Ebola, and Zika virus outbreaks (1).

A data-driven assessment of early travel restrictions related to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 within mainland China,"Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","In Dec. 31st, 2019, Chinese authorities reported an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease, called COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Due to the proximity of the Spring Festival, the Chinese Government implemented quarantine in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, as well as in several nearby cities since Jan. 23rd, 2020. As of Feb. 16th the outbreak is still growing and has already infected 68,584 individuals in China of which 1,666 have died [1] . Much is still unknown about the characteristics of this pathogen. For instance, it remains unclear the animal source of this zoonotic disease, being bats and pangolins currently the two most likely sources [2] [3] [4] . It has also been proposed that more than half of the cases might have gone undetected by routinely screening passengers, due to the special characteristics of this disease [5] , which makes it possible that infected individuals are asymptomatic while infectious."
Structure-Guided Mutagenesis Alters Deubiquitinating Activity 2 and Attenuates Pathogenesis of a Murine Coronavirus,"Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as 17 a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which 18 removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies 19 implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but 20 the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-21 guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the 22 ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 23 processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus 24 and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured 25 macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type 26 virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared 27 to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively 28 regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type 29 virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) 30 in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus 31 infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided 32 mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that 33 PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.","Since one of the primary goals of this study is to understand the contribution of DUB 118 activity to viral replication and pathogenesis, we next focused on quantitating further the effects 119 of the D1772A mutant on the steady-state kinetic parameters of MHV PLP2 toward the three 120 different substrates (Fig. 2B) . The RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate is often used as surrogate of 121 the viral polyprotein substrate and the kinetic data in Fig. 2B show that this substrate is still well-122 recognized and cleaved by the D1772A mutant. In fact, we observed a small rate enhancement in 123 the catalytic efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme."

Identification of peptide coatings that enhance diffusive transport of nanoparticles through the tumor microenvironment,"In solid tumors, increasing drug penetration promotes their regression and improves the therapeutic index of compounds. However, the heterogeneous extracellular matrix (ECM) acts a steric and interaction barrier that hinders effective transport of therapeutics, including nanomedicines. Specifically, the interactions between the ECM and surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity) impedes their diffusion and penetration.",significantly higher diffusive transport of phage than negative control through in vitro tumor ECM.
Mycroft-West et al. (2020) Running title: SARS-CoV-2 surface S1 Receptor Binding Domain binds heparin The 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein (Spike) S1 Receptor Binding Domain undergoes conformational change upon heparin binding,"Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.","Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a polydisperse, heterogenous natural product. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins and heparinoids are clinically approved as anticoagulants / thrombotic with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which lacking significant anticoagulant activity 1 , are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including coronaviridae and SARSassociated coronavirus strain HSR1 2 , in addition to flaviviruses 3, 4 , herpes 5 , influenza 6 and HIV 7, 8 ."

The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of inhospital death.

"Evidence for influenza B virus hemagglutinin adaptation to the human host: high cleavability, acid-stability and 2 preference for cool temperature Running title: Adaptation of influenza B virus HA to human airways 5 6","Influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) cause yearly epidemics with significant 25 morbidity and mortality. When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral 26 hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In 27 contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. 28 Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address 29 this question, we compared seasonal IAV (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and IBV viruses 30 (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the 31 mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation 32 of HA, by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein 33 enzymes, many of which proved present in human respiratory epithelium. Compared to 34 IAV, the IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with 35 much higher efficiency. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, was 36 sufficient to abrogate spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. 37 Second, the HA fusion pH proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (one exception 38 being HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33°C, a temperature 39 required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of 40 IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These 41 distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host-adaptation 42 during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population. 43 2 All rights reserved.

In addition, influenza A virus (IAV) causes 58 sporadic pandemics with an even more severe impact on public health. Influenza B virus 59 (IBV) does not cause pandemics but is responsible for a significant proportion of seasonal 60 influenza (3). IBV may account for 22-44% of influenza deaths in children (3) To understand how these human airway-specific factors may influence the membrane 117 fusion activity of HA, we here compared the HA proteins of four seasonal human IAV and 118 IBV viruses. Their proteolytic activation was analyzed by covering all members of the 119 human TTSP (39) and kallikrein (KLK) families (40). We demonstrate that IBV HA exhibits 120 much more efficient activation by a broad range of airway proteases, explaining why 121 TMPRSS2 alone was required for spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial 122 cells. Whereas the HA proteins of IBV and human IAV showed similar low pH-dependence 123 to trigger membrane fusion, a distinction was seen in terms of temperature dependence, 124 with IBV HA having clear preference for 33°C. For one of the two IBV lineages, this cooler 125 temperature was required to achieve membrane fusion. We propose that these distinct 126 IBV HA0 is efficiently cleaved by a broad range of TTSPs 149 To investigate which of these proteases can activate the HA proteins of IAV or IBV, 150 expression plasmids were generated for all 18 human TTSPs and 16 KLKs, bearing a C-151 terminal flag tag (for details see Table S1 ). When we analyzed expression in transfected 152 cells, most proteases showed a protein level similar to that of TMPRSS2 regarded as the 153 reference (Fig. S1C ). For TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS12, TMPRSS7 and KLK13, expression 154 was three-fold lower. For TMPRSS11D/HAT and TMPRSS11E/DESC1 expression was 155 very weak, meaning that the results from the HA cleavage assay are an underestimate for 156 these two proteases. In this assay, the proteases were co-expressed with the HAs from 157 four seasonal IAV (A/H1 and A/H3) and IBV (B/Yam and B/Vic) viruses ( Fig. 2A ). HA0 158 cleavage was assessed by western blot for the HA1 or HA2 cleavage product, depending 159 on which epitope was recognized by the anti-HA antibody. The % cleaved HA was 160 calculated relative to the trypsin control, consisting of cells transfected with HA plus empty 161 plasmid, and briefly exposed to exogenous trypsin. 162 163 TMPRSS2 was the only protease that efficiently cleaved all four IAV/IBV HA0 proteins 164 tested. It was the only protease with high activity on A/H3 HA0 ( Fig. 2B and 2C ), while 165 A/H1 HA0 was equally well cleaved by TMPRSS4. On the other hand, the two IBV HA0 166 proteins were efficiently processed by four TTSPs (Fig. 2B and 2C ), namely TMPRSS11F, 167 TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS13/MSPL. Besides, IBV HA0 was cleaved by 168 TMPRSS11A and TMPRSS11D/HAT, yet low expression of the latter protease (see 169 above) precluded conclusions on cleavage efficiency. B/Yam HA0 was also recognized none of the kallikreins was found to be a broad HA activator. KLK14 cleaved both IBV 173 proteins, and KLK5 and KLK6 cleaved B/Yam HA0 with low efficacy. In summary, we 174 demonstrated that, compared to its IAV counterpart, IBV HA0 can use a broader panel of 175 TTSPs for efficient proteolytic cleavage. 176 177 All HA0-cleaving TTSPs generate membrane fusion-competent IBV HA 178 We next examined whether HA0 cleavage translates into HA activation. We first employed 179 a polykaryon assay (Fig. 3A) in which HeLa cells that co-express HA and protease, are 193 To verify that the TTSPs activate HA for membrane fusion during viral entry, we employed 194 a retroviral pseudotyping system (Fig. 4A ). Each HA was combined with its cognate 195 neuraminidase (NA) to assure efficient particle release (43, 44) . Pseudoparticles were 196 produced in the presence or absence of TTSPs, treated with PBS or trypsin and then 197 examined for their ability to transduce target cells (Fig. 4A ). In Fig. 4B and 4C, the colored 198 bars show transduction efficiency of TTSP-activated particles, whereas the white bars 199 show total particle infectivity upon additional treatment with trypsin. control. This superior activation of the IBV particles was also evident from the observation 212 that subsequent trypsin treatment gave a lower signal increase for the IBV compared to 213 the IAV particles (see white bars in Fig. 4B Table S5 ) replication in Calu-3 cells was the same whether trypsin was added or not (P-245 value > 0.1, Fig. S3 ), meaning that these cells express one or more HA0-activating 246 proteases. The four viruses were similarly inhibited by three serine protease inhibitors 247 (see antiviral EC50 values in Table S5 ; a brief description of the assay is provided below 248 this Table) but were not blocked by a furin inhibitor, consistent with furin's inability to 249 process monobasic HA0 cleavage sites (41). We also observed no effect with inhibitors 250 of lysosomal cathepsins, which activate some unrelated viruses that enter by endocytosis 251 (51). Thus, HA activation in Calu-3 cells relies on one or more serine proteases. TMPRSS2 and the most efficacious IBV HA activators identified above (Fig. 5D ). Hence, 264 the spread of IBV appears to rely on redundant proteases, concurring with the above 265 findings that, besides TMPRSS2, several proteases effectively activate the IBV HA 266 protein. 269   cells   270   To assess whether some TTSPs might stand out as activators of IBV, we included Madin-271 Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells which, alike Calu-3 cells, support replication of IBV in 272 the absence of trypsin (52). This observation was also made for 1918 IAV (50, 53) which, 273 in this regard, is unique among human IAV strains. Indeed, our seasonal IBV but not IAV 274 viruses did not require exogenous trypsin to replicate in MDCK cells (Fig. 6A ). HA0 275 cleavage during IBV replication was inhibited by the broad serine protease inhibitor 276 camostat ( Fig. 6B) , hence executed by one or more proteases of this family. mRNA 277 quantification in MDCK cells (see Table S3 for dog-specific primers) revealed abundant 278 expression of ST14/matriptase, as observed before (54, 55) and TMPRSS4 (Fig. 6C ). 279 Another study (50) found no TMPRSS4 mRNA in MDCK cells, potentially related to the 280 use of different MDCK cell lines (56). Canine TMPRSS4 was cloned into an expression 281 plasmid to investigate its HA0-cleaving capacity. Canine TMPRSS4 proved a strong 282 activator for IBV HA, and more effective on A/H1 HA from 1918 IAV compared to 2009 283 pandemic (Virg09) IAV (Fig. 6D ). The lowest efficiency was seen for A/H3 HA. The 284 polykaryon assay confirmed that fusion-competent HA was formed (pictures in Fig. 6D ). 285 The mRNA data suggested that canine TMPRSS4 or ST14/matriptase might be 286 responsible for spread of IBV in MDCK cells. For IAV HA, published data on the role of 287 matriptase are not consistent (55, 57, 58) . Although our data thus far argued against a 288 direct role for matriptase, an indirect role (e.g. as an activator of TMPRSS4) could not be 289 excluded. With this is mind, we performed knockdown for canine TMPRSS4 and 290 matriptase individually or in combination ( Fig. 6E and 6F ). Knockdown efficiency was 291 >85% based on RT-qPCR for mRNA. Virus replication and HA0 cleavage in IBV-infected 292 MDCK cells proved unaffected by knockdown of TMPRSS4, matriptase, nor a 293 combination of the two (Fig. 6F) . Thus, both in Calu-3 and MDCK cells, IBV does not seem 294 to rely on one single protease for its replication. Cleavage of HA0 into HA1-HA2 activates the protein for membrane fusion, but also 298 renders HA susceptible to inactivation at acidic pH. The human nasal cavity is mildly acidic 299 (average pH: 6.3 in healthy adults and 5.9 in children) (30, 59). For pandemic IAV, 300 acquirement of a more acid-stable HA is considered a prerequisite to achieve human-to-301 human transmissibility (27, 31, 43, 60) . Since IBV is restricted to humans, we asked 302 whether IBV possesses an acid-stable HA. Indeed, the polykaryon assay showed that the On the other hand, the shape of the pH curves was distinct for IBV HA. For human-307 adapted IAV HAs, the curves showed a discrete pH value at which the number of 308 polykaryons was maximal, and a steep decline at more acidic pH due to HA inactivation 309 (63). In contrast, both IBV HAs produced high numbers of polykaryons over the entire low 310 pH range. Hence, IBV HA is triggered for fusion at a similar acidic pH as IAV HA, however 311 the IBV protein may be more resistant to acidic conditions. Besides, we noticed that 1918 312 A/H1 HA (Fig. 7D ) had the highest fusion pH among the tested human IAV HAs, its value 313 (5.7) being as high as that of avian A/H5 HA (Fig. 7E ). This might explain the superior 314 transduction efficiency of 1918 IAV pseudoparticles (see above), since an increased 315 fusion pH enables earlier endosomal escape and more efficient infection (28). 316 15 All rights reserved.

The impact of news exposure on collective attention in the United States during the 2016 Zika epidemic,"In recent years, many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources -Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive -to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geolocalized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic.

The reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 based on estimate of a statistical time delay dynamical system,"In this paper, we estimate the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 based on Wallinga and Lipsitch framework [11] and a novel statistical time delay dynamic system. We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC [9], and the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25 ≤ R 0 ≤ 3.4 if we simply use R = 1 + r * T c with T c = 7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS.

Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Characteristics of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation: A Statistical Analysis of Publicly Available Case Data,"The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.","As of 31 January 2020, mainland China reported 11,791 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) infections, causing 259 deaths [1] . Initially, these infections were thought to result from zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission; however, recently published evidence [2] and the exponential growth of case incidences show compelling evidence of human-to-human secondary transmission fueled by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world [3] . This geographic expansion beyond the initial epicenter of Wuhan provides an opportunity to study the natural history of COVID-19 infection, as these migration events limit the risk of infection to the time during which an individual traveled to an area where exposure could occur [4] ."
Direct Measurement of Rates of Asymptomatic Infection and Clinical Care- Seeking for Seasonal Coronavirus,"The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.","The Wuhan novel coronavirus (nCoV) appears to have emerged in humans in the Hubei province of China during December 2019 (1) . The virus was definitively identified in the first week of 2020 and as of January 29 had spread to 15 other countries; 6065 confirmed cases, 9239 suspected cases, and 132 deaths have been reported (2) ; however, the total number of infections (confirmed, suspected and unreported) remains unknown."
Estimating the infection and case fatality ratio for COVID-19 using age-adjusted data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship,"Adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-death, we estimated case and infection fatality ratios (CFR, IFR) for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship as 2.3% (0.75%-5.3%) and 1.2% (0.38-2.7%). Comparing deaths onboard with expected deaths based on naive CFR estimates using China data, we estimate IFR and CFR in China to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.2%) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3-2.4%) respectively.","In real-time, estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) can be biased upwards by under-reporting of cases and downwards by failure to account for the delay from confirmation-to-death. Collecting detailed epidemiological information from a closed population such as the quarantined Diamond Princess can produce a more comprehensive description of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and their subsequent outcomes. Using data from the Diamond Princess, and adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-outcome and agestructure of the ship's occupants, we estimated the IFR and CFR for the outbreak in China. As of 3rd March 2020, there have been 92,809 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with 3,164 deaths [1] . On 1st February 2020, a patient tested positive for COVID-19 in Hong Kong; they disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship on the 25th January [2, 3] . This patient had onset of symptoms on the 19th January, one day before boarding the ship [2] . Upon returning to Yokohama, Japan, on February 3rd, the ship was held in quarantine, during which testing was performed in order to measure COVID-19 infections among the 3,711 passengers and crew members onboard. Passengers were initially to be held in quarantine for 14 days. However, those that had intense exposure to the confirmed case-patient, such as sharing a cabin, were held in quarantine beyond the initial 14-day window [3] . By 20 th February, there were 634 confirmed cases onboard (17%), with 328 of these asymptomatic (asymptomatic cases were either self-assessed or tested positive before symptom onset) [3] . Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age [3] . For details on the testing procedure, see [2] and [3] ."
Epidemic size of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in the Epicenter Wuhan: using data of five-countries' evacuation action,"Background: Since late December 2019, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation.","In the late December 2019, a pneumonia, now known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [1] . The outbreak of NCP quickly showed the characteristic of human-to-human transmission. Chinese health authorities did an immediate investigation to characterize and control the disease, including isolation of suspected cases, monitoring of close contacts, collection of epidemiological and clinical data from confirmed patients, and development of diagnostic and treatment procedures [2] . As of Feb 4, 2020, a total of 24,324 cases with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have been detected in China, of whom 490 have died [3] . There were 8,351 cases confirmed in Wuhan, 362 of the confirmed cases have died, the case fatality was much higher in Wuhan than in the other areas of China [4] . Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries. After assessing the virus-related information, the WHO decided to declare it as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on Jan 31, 2020 [5] ."
Analytical sensibility and specificity of two RT-qPCR protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection performed in an automated workflow,"The World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 became mandatory to identify, isolate and provide optimized care for patients early. RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The proposed assay detected the fisrt SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian Central-West.","On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 became mandatory to identify, isolate and provide optimized care for patients early 1 .

Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, subexponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t µ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents µ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","The current outbreak of the new coronavirus in Mainland China (COVID-19, previously named 2019-nCoV) is closely monitored by governments, researchers, and the public alike [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The rapid increase of positively diagnosed cases in Mainland China and subsequent exportation and confirmation of cases in more than 20 countries worldwide raised concern on an international scale. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore announced the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [4] ."
Fitness barriers limit reversion of a proofreading-deficient coronavirus 1 2,"word count: 359 20 Text word count: 4423 21 22 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. ABSTRACT 23 The 3¢-to-5¢ exoribonuclease in coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) 24 mediates RNA proofreading during genome replication. ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in 25 three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four 26 nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants 27 with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. 28 Despite these impairments, MHV-and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have 29 not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound 30 fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA 31 with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show 32 that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or 33 competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-34 AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. 35 Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-36 adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while 37 reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than 38 intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to 39 fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate 40 potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at 41 stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. 42 43 All rights reserved.

High mutation rates in RNA viruses generate extensive 58 opportunities to overcome evolutionary hurdles, such as antiviral drugs, host immunity, or 59 engineered attenuating changes (1). The evolutionary pathways traversed by RNA viruses are 60 shaped by natural selection, which will favor some evolutionary trajectories more than others 61 based on whether mutations are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral (2). Predicting the likely results 62 of RNA virus evolution is an important step for anticipating viral emergence and for developing 63 escape-resistant antiviral drugs and vaccines (3, 4). 64 65 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses that cause human illnesses 66 ranging from the common cold to severe and lethal respiratory disease (5). All CoVs encode a 67 proofreading exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is critical for 68 replication, fidelity, fitness, and virulence, and ExoN-inactivation has been proposed as a 69 strategy for live-attenuated vaccine development (6-15). As members of the DEDDh superfamily 70 of exonucleases, CoV ExoNs hydrolyze nucleotides using four metal-coordinating amino acids 71 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/618249 doi: bioRxiv preprint ExoN active site mutants in alphacoronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus and 77 hCoV-229E, have yet to be recovered and are proposed to be lethal for replication (19, 20) . infections and prolonged passage in tissue culture and following treatment with multiple 87 nucleoside analogues (6-11, 13, 14). SARS-CoV-ExoN-AA also is stable during acute and 88 persistent animal infections in immunocompetent and immune-compromised mice (12) . The lack 89 of primary reversion is not due simply to reduced adaptive capacity, as both SARS-CoV-and 90 MHV-ExoN-AA can adapt for increased replication (7, 14). Most strikingly, long-term passage 91 of MHV-ExoN-AA (250 passages, P250) yielded a highly fit population that had directly 92 compensated for defective proofreading through evolution of a likely high-fidelity RdRp (7 requires mutations to all four sites ( Figure 1A ).

Combination attenuation offers strategy for live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines 1 2,"With an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains, new strategies are required to 8 prepare for the next emergent coronavirus (CoV). Previously, groups had targeted conserved 9 coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current 10 and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a 11 conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against 12 future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was 13 evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential 14 for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and 15 potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, 16 combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a 17 vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, 18 and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase 19 in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for 20 rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.","Emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response 23 vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV 24 vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions 25 and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised. This study 26 illustrates that despite success in young models, the NSP16 mutant carries too much risk for 27 pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy."
Department of Occupational and Environmental Health,2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV), which first occurred in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

Title: HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion required for efficient cytosolic delivery of therapeutic peptides and small proteins,"Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs-an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape. 4 conclude that HOPS allows CPMPs to traffic into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), a favorable environment for endosomal escape. The identification of ILVs as a portal for passing proteins into the cytosol will aid the development of next-generation biologics that overcome the limitations imposed by cellular membranes.","Protein and peptide therapeutics-biologics-comprise a rapidly growing sector of the modern pharmacopeia (1) . Seven of the top ten highest grossing therapeutic agents in 2017 are biologics used to treat cancer (2, 3) , diabetes (4) , and autoimmune inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease (5) (6) (7) . In each case, the biologic acts by stimulating, inhibiting, or replacing a protein located within plasma or on an external membrane surface (1) . Not one acts within the cell cytosol or nucleus, in large part because most proteins cannot effectively breach the barrier defined by the plasma membrane (8, 9) . The well-known early exceptions to this rule discovered by Löwenstein (10) , Pabo (11) , and Derossi (12)-the HIV trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein and the Antennapedia homeodomain-have inspired the synthesis, study, and (in some cases) clinical evaluation (13) of literally hundreds of arginine-rich ""cell-penetrating peptides"" (CPPs) (14) . The problem is that when added to cells, most CPPs remain trapped in endosomes and fail to achieve significant concentrations in the cytosol or nucleus (15) . The inefficient delivery of proteins, peptides, and their mimetics into the mammalian cell cytosol limits their potential as therapeutics and research tools."
In silico approach to accelerate the development of mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods for detection of viral proteins: Application to COVID-19,"The novel coronavirus disease first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, has become a serious global public health concern. One current issue is the ability to adequately screen for the virus causing COVID-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of shotgun proteomics as a SARS-CoV-2 screening method, through the detection of viral peptides in proteolytically digested body fluids. Using in silico methods, we generated trypsin-based shotgun proteomics methods optimized for LCMS systems from 5 commercial instrument vendors (Thermo, SCIEX, Waters, Shimadzu, and Agilent). First, we generated protein FASTA files and their protein digest maps. Second, the FASTA files were used to generate spectral libraries based on experimental data. Third, transition lists were derived from the","The detection of viral proteins in body fluids can be a rapid and specific diagnostic for infection in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 1-3 During the 2003 (SARS) outbreak, non-MS based methods of protein detection proved to be more successful 4,5 than LCMS methods. [6] [7] [8] Non-MS based methods, such as western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and protein arrays, rely on antibodies for the detection of proteins. Given recent studies concerning high variability in antibody production, LCMS-based methods are an attractive alternative approach for the rapid identification of small molecules, proteins, and peptides in clinical settings where consistency is paramount. 9, 10 In the 15 years since the 2003 SARS outbreak, LCMS technology has experienced a revolution led primarily by increases in the speed, sensitivity, and resolution of MS instruments. Today, protein array and antibody-based methods are falling out of favor in both research and clinical diagnostics, due in large part to the improvements in LCMS technology. 11, 12 A review of this growth by Grebe and Singh described a clinical lab with no LCMS systems in 1998 that completed over 2 million individual LCMS clinical assays in 2010. 13 Incremental improvements in rapid sample preparation techniques, chromatography, and data processing have also contributed to the increasing use of LCMS-based clinical testing. A 2013 study demonstrated the level of advance by identifying 4,000 yeast proteins in one hour of LCMS run time, identifying approximately 75 proteins/min at a rate 100 times faster than studies a decade prior. 14 LCMS methods can measure protein quantity by either the intact protein (protein-centric) or the analysis of proteolytic peptides (peptide-centric). While the mass to charge (m/z) ratio of a peptide or protein (MS1) may be a specific diagnostic in some materials, the majority of LCMS methods employ tandem MS in which the peptide or protein parent ion is subjected to gas phase collision to produce fragment ions. The measurement of the fragment ions (MS2) has a higher specificity and lower level of false positives and is the method of choice in clinical diagnostics. 12, 13 Protein-centric assays, such as intact parallel reaction monitoring or proteoform monitoring, performs well on small GTPases like KRAS, but larger proteins cannot currently be monitored with the same relative ease and accuracy. 15 For this reason, peptide-centric assays are currently the dominant proteomics approach."
Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs,"Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.","A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged with connections to Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, Hubei Province of China in late December 2019. On January 7, 2020, a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the causative agent, and the World Health Organization (WHO) named this novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV on January 10. By January 30, a total of 9692 confirmed cases with 213 deaths had been reported in the world. As reported in, 1 in comparison with the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which is about 4.91, R 0 of the 2019-nCoV epidemic was estimated as high as 6.47, which implies the severity of this widespread dissemination caused by 2019-nCoV. Under the current health emergency, many researchers around the world engaged in the investigation of the genetic and functional data of 2019-nCoV and compare to other coronaviruses to design proper infection control strategy 2, 3 and seek potential drugs that can prevent and/or cure this serious epidemic. [4] [5] [6] [7] On January 10, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was first released on GenBank (accession MN908947) by Yong-Zhen Zhang's group at Fudan University. 8 Subsequently, phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV belonged to the Betacoronavirus genera and its closest whole-genome relatives are two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, i.e., ZC45 and ZXC21, which shared about 89% sequence identity with 2019-nCoV. 6, 7 Moreover, detailed sequence alignment data indicates that there is significant genetics distance between the 2019-nCoV and the human SARS-CoV. Therefore, the 2019-nCoV should be considered as a new type of bat coronavirus. However, this observation raised a worth-thinking issue whether the 2019-nCoV has the same infective mechanisms as the human SARS-CoV."

Gene birth contributes to structural disorder encoded by overlapping genes,"The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.","Protein-coding genes sometimes overlap, i.e. the same nucleotide sequence encodes different proteins in different reading frames. Most of the overlapping pairs of genes that have been characterized to date are found in viral, bacterial and mitochondrial genomes, with emerging research showing that they may be common in eukaryotic genomes as well [10] , [20] , [31] , [32] , [37] . Studying overlapping genes can shed light on the processes of de novo gene birth [36] ."
Contacts in context: large-scale setting-specific social mixing matrices from the BBC Pandemic project,"Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread.

In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for","For directly transmitted respiratory pathogens such as influenza, measles and coronaviruses, social mixing patterns shape the risk of individual-level infection [6] and population-level transmission dynamics [29, 18] , as well as the effectiveness of control measures targeted at specific age groups [2] . Typically two main approaches have been used to measure social mixing patterns relevant for the spread of disease: inference of contacts based on wearable devices such as proximity sensors [26, 20] , or self-recording of contacts [9] . As well as being able to capture age-specific patterns of infection [18] , self-recording also allow for details of the type and setting of social contacts, and demographic information about the contacts themselves."
A novel framework for inferring parameters of transmission 1 from viral sequence data,"Transmission between hosts is a critical part of the viral lifecycle. Recent studies of viral transmission have 9 used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role 10 of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data 11 describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive frame-12 work for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events. Our model describes 13 transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than independent alleles. We demonstrate how 14 selection and noisy sequence data may each affect inferences of the population bottleneck, and identify 15 circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified. Applying 16 our model to data from a previous experimental transmission study, we show that our approach grants a 17 more quantitative insight into viral transmission, inferring that between 2 to 6 viruses initiated infection, 18 and allowing for a more informed interpretation of transmission events. While our model is here applied 19 to influenza transmission, the framework we present is highly generalisable to other systems. Our work 20 provides new opportunities for studying viral transmission.","Straightforward statistics describing a population may generate misleading inferences of population bottleneck size. In the illustrated case, the genetic structure of a population is changed by a population bottleneck during transmission, but the frequency of each allele within the population does not change; an inference of bottleneck size derived from single-locus statistics would incorrectly be very large. C.

This study aims to calculate its 25 case fatality rate (CFR). 26,"should be corrected as cases at T days before, where T is an average time period from case 67 confirmation to death. This study aims to calculate the CFR of the COVID-19 in China by 68 estimating the average time period from case confirmation to death. it should be realized that deaths at day X are averagely from cases at day X-T rather than day 75 X. Given a T value, a group of CFRs (daily CFRs) can be obtained from different X days. As 76 known that death number at day X should be less than case number at day X-T (if more than 77 day X-T, CFR would be greater than 100% which is illogical). Based on this point, the range 78 of T can be narrowed. More importantly, no matter what T value is assumed, even it is far 79 away from the true T value, the daily CFRs would converge towards (infinitely approach to 80 but never be over) the true CFR with time (X) increases. The following example will illustrate 81 this principle (Table 1) . Assuming CFR = 10%, T = 4 for a disease, the cases number was 82 from 100 to 10000 at day X (X=1 to 100), then the deaths number would be 10 (10, 20 and so 83 on) at day X+4 (5, 6 and so on). When calculating daily CFRs based on case and death 84 numbers with formula deaths (X) divided by cases (X-T), law 1: if assumed T was equal to 85 the true T value (4 in the example), calculated daily CFRs at different day X would constantly 86 be the true CFR (0.1); if assumed T was greater than the true T (5 and 6), daily CFRs would 87 be greater than the true CFR (0.1) and infinitely reduce to near it with the time (X) increased; 88 .

Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a group of non-enveloped, 49 single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses in the family Astroviridae. 50 HAstVs are causative agents of viral diarrhea in young children, 51 immunocompromised patients, and elderly individuals (1-5). The astrovirus 52 genome has three open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode two 53 nonstructural polyproteins (nsPs), and ORF2 encodes the capsid protein (6). The 54 nsP1a polyprotein, transcribed from ORF1a, is involved in viral transcription 55 and replication. When HAstV infects a host cell, nsP1a is cleaved into at least 56 four products, named nsP1a/1, nsP1a/2, nsP1a/3 (protease), and nsP1a/4. The 57 nsP1a/4 protein is located at the C-terminal end of nsP1a.Several domains have 58 been identified in nsP1a/4, including two coiled-coil regions, a death domain 59 (DD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a putative viral genome-linked 60 protein(VPg), and a hypervariable region (HVR)(7-12). It was confirmed that 61 nsP1a/4 plays important roles in the activation of capsid maturation and the 62 regulation of RNA replication (13, 14). To better understand the roles of nsP1a 63 and nsP1a/4 in HAstV infection and replication, we characterized host proteins 64","showed that nsP1a/4 and CD63 co-localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells. 28 Over expression of CD63 promoted viral RNA synthesis, whereas knockdown 29 of CD63 markedly decreased viral RNA levels. Those results suggest that CD63 30 plays a critical role in human astrovirus RNA replication. The interaction 31 between CD63 and nsP1a/4 provides a channel to further understand the roles of 32 interactions between host and virus proteins in astrovirus infection and release.

Glycosyltransferases promote development and prevent promiscuous cell,"The mechanisms underlying multicellular development in the animal stem lineage may 25 be reconstructed through the study of choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of 26 animals. To determine the genetic underpinnings of multicellularity in the emerging 27 model choanoflagellate S. rosetta, we performed a screen for mutants with defects in 28 multicellular rosette development. In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single 29 cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into 30 amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding 31 glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the 32 extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to 33 donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and 34 cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that 35 glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation 36 in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating 37 development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.","The evolution of multicellular eukaryotes from their single-celled ancestors was a 42 major transition in evolutionary history and allowed for the subsequent origin and 43 diversification of complex macroscopic life (Leigh et al., 1995) .

A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in 26 children,"Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were different from adult.

Life course exposures continually shape antibody profile and risk of seroconversion to influenza,"medRxiv preprint Effect of pre-existing immunity on seroconversion to recent strains Pre-existing, homologous titer to circulating strains is a well-described predictor of risk of seroconversion (14), which is confirmed in our study (Table 1 and tables S5 and S6). However, we hypothesized that including metrics of antibody profiles that integrate previous exposure history would further improve predictions of the risk of seroconversion. Therefore, we examined the association between the risk of seroconversion with age at baseline sampling, pre-existing, homologous titer to outcome strains (the ith strain), titer to the i-1th strain, and summary metrics .

Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8% of participants, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest variation. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza."
"Real-time, MinION-based, amplicon sequencing for lineage typing of infectious bronchitis virus from upper respiratory samples","Infectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples.","Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the most important diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses worldwide. 8 Clinical signs of disease are diverse and include respiratory distress, severe ocular discharge, poor body weight gain, decreased egg production, flushing (renal disease), and occasionally mortality in chickens. 7 IB is often complicated by secondary bacterial (e.g., E. coli, Mycoplasma sp.) and viral infections (e.g., avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious laryngotracheitis virus). 43 Lack of cross protection among IBV serotypes is a challenge to controlling IB 15 ; therefore, control of IB relies heavily on serotype-specific live attenuated vaccines. 8 Collectively, the presence of multiple IBVs in a single sample, emergence of variant IBVs, and the high genetic diversity of IBV can complicate the diagnosis of IB and illustrate the need for enhanced diagnostics. 15 "

Generating genomic platforms to study Candida albicans pathogenesis,"The advent of the genomic era has made elucidating gene function at large scale a pressing challenge. ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources towards this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5,102 ORFs cloned in a Gateway™ donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags, and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein-protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway™-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment. These unique and valuable resources should greatly facilitate future functional studies in C. albicans and the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie its pathogenicity. author/funder.

"Estimation of local novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan, China from off-site reported cases and population flow data from different sources","Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu.

How domain growth is implemented determines the long term behaviour of a cell population through its effect on spatial correlations,"Domain growth plays an important role in many biological systems, and so the inclusion of domain growth in models of these biological systems is important to understanding how these biological systems function. In this work we present methods to include the effects of domain growth on the evolution of spatial correlations in a continuum approximation of a lattice-based model of cell motility and proliferation. We show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different steady-state densities are predicted for an agent population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the way in which domain growth is implemented can result in the evolution of the agent density depending on the size of the domain. Continuum approximations that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture these behaviours, while those that account for spatial correlations do. These results will be of interest to researchers in developmental biology, as they suggest that the nature of domain growth can determine the characteristics of cell populations. * ross@maths.ox.ac.uk","Growth is of fundamental importance in biological systems [1, 2] . From embryonic development to tissue renewal, growth plays a central role in the development, maintenance and repair of biological systems throughout their lifetime [3] .

Estimating the Efficacy of Quarantine and Traffic Blockage for the Epidemic Caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19)：A Simulation Analysis,"Background: Since the 2019-nCoV outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk.

Alphavirus nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase Activity Disrupts Stress Granule Formation,"Formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic condensates of stalled translation initiation complexes, is regulated by post-translational protein modification. Alphaviruses interfere with SG formation in response to inhibition of host protein synthesis through the activities of nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3). nsP3 has a conserved N-terminal macrodomain that binds and can remove ADP-ribose from ADPribosylated proteins and a C-terminal hypervariable domain that binds essential SG component G3BP1.","Page 5 macrodomain (MD) in the N-terminus, a central zinc-binding domain, and a C-terminal hypervariable domain (HVD), which is of low-complexity [39] . Recent studies indicate that short peptide motifs within the HVD direct nsP3 binding to host SG proteins [39, 40, 43] . Specifically, two repeat peptide motifs within the HVD of the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) bind to the essential SG components G3BP1 and G3BP2 [40, 44] . Given that the expression of alphaviral nsP3 alone suppresses SG formation and nsP3 expression increases over the course of viral infection, it was proposed that nsP3 sequesters G3BP1/2 resulting in SG disassembly during the late phase of infection [35, 36, 41] ."
A diallel of the mouse Collaborative Cross founders reveals strong strain-specific maternal effects on litter size,"Reproductive success in the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) was measured using a diallel-mating scheme. Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and 24,782 weaned pups were used across 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (79%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam's strain explained more than the sire's strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam's strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background and that litter size is largely determined by dam.strain rather than sire.strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains. KEYWORDS F1 cross additive heritability fertility BayesDiallel zero-truncated Poisson variance projection","A critical part of fitness is optimizing the balance between numbers of offspring, offspring body size, and reproductive timing, leading to strong selection for these traits (Smith and Fretwell 1974; Beauchamp and Kacelnik 1990) . Fundamental fitness traits, like litter size (i.e., the number of pups born per litter), should have low contributions of genetic variance due to rapid fixation of alleles that increase fitness (Mousseau and Roff 1987; Price and Schluter 1991; Merilä and Sheldon 1999; Stirling et al. 2002; Peripato et al. 2004) . Estimates of litter size heritability vary from 5% to 20% in mouse, rabbit, and porcine populations (Falconer 1960; Avalos and Smith 1987; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Johnson et al. 1999; Garcıa and Baselga 2002; Peripato et al. 2004; Gutiérrez et al. 2006) leading to the majority of variation in litter size being non-heritable. Nonheritable factors include seasonality, food availability, paternal and maternal effects, dominance and epistasis, as well as unknown factors. Additionally, sexual conflict over parental investment may exist between females and males, and this in turn could affect litter size (Trivers 1974; Hager and Johnstone 2003) . These factors make it difficult to obtain clear measurements of litter size in wild populations. A controlled laboratory environment is therefore necessary to measure genetic effects of litter size (Jinks and Broadhurst 1963; Roberts 1960; Bandy and Eisen 1984; Hoornbeek 1968; Peripato et al. 2004; Gutiérrez et al. 2006; Varona and Sorensen 2014) ."

MUC5AC drives COPD exacerbation severity through amplification of virus-induced airway inflammation,"The respiratory tract surface is protected from inhaled pathogens by a secreted layer of mucus that is rich in mucin glycoproteins. Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5ACdeficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory airway disorder punctuated by acute exacerbations, frequently precipitated by rhinoviruses (RVs) 1,2 . Exacerbations are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD 3, 4 and a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is urgently needed to facilitate development of new therapies to reduce the impact of these debilitating episodes."
Diarrhea may be underestimated: a missing link in 2019 novel coronavirus,"Based on results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","In December 2019, the first pneumonia case caused by a previously unknown coronavirus 2019-nCoV occurred in Wuhan City, China. Soon afterward, a series of pneumonia cases caused by 2019-nCoV emerged in other provinces in mainland China."

Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post-pandemic period,"There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years.

Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","4 betacoronaviruses can induce immune responses against one another: SARS infection can generate neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 (15) and HCoV-OC43 infection can generate cross-reactive antibodies against SARS (16) . However, due to the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and a relative lack of surveillance data on the existing human coronaviruses, it has not been possible to project how the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in the coming years, including the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the seasonal coronaviruses."

"A novel real-time PCR assay panel for detection of common 1 respiratory pathogens in a convenient, strip-tube array format 2 Running title: Respiratory PCR panel in a strip-tube array format Assistant Professor of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Introduction","Commercial multiplex assays, built on different chemistries and platforms are widely 25 available for simultaneous detection of pathogens that cause respiratory infections. However, 26 these tests are often difficult to implement in a resource limited setting because of high cost. In 27 this study, we developed and validated a method for simultaneous testing of common respiratory 28 pathogens (Respanel) by real-time PCR in a convenient, strip-tube array format. Primers and 29 probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following 30 optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-31 probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips. Nucleic acid extracts from specimens were 32 mixed with PCR master mix, and dispensed column-wise into 2X8-wells of a 96-well plate.","tests offer many advantages including a rapid response time and the ability to detect organisms 70 that will not grow in culture. In addition these tests allow detection of bacteria in patients where 71 antimicrobial treatment has been initiated prior to collection of the sample. We now have access 72 to accurate and rapid multiplex assays simultaneously detecting both viral and bacterial 73 pathogens within a few hours. The ability to diagnose co-infections is a significant improvement 74 as these can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality (19) (20) (21) . Rapid molecular tests 75 have been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay and the cost for testing for those with viral 76 respiratory testing and has facilitated a more targeted approach to patients presenting with 77 respiratory infections with respect to treatment regimens, need for admission and infection 78 control concerns (7, (22) (23) (24) . which are missed by the existing assays. Therefore, in this study, we developed an in-house PCR 106 assay panel (Respanel) customized to detect the most common, and clinically significant 107 respiratory pathogens.

Original Article,"Background: New endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 . In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach. Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.","However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ACE2 [15] . This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses."
A transmissible RNA pathway in honey bees,"Honey bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiates RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive.","In eukaryotes, sequence-specific gene silencing pathways, generally termed RNA interference (RNAi), are induced and maintained by the presence of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) [1] . Through processing of based-paired RNA into small RNAs, these mechanisms regulate gene expression in both co-transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels [2] . While RNA-mediated nascent transcript destabilization and heterochromatin remodeling inhibits gene transcription, post-transcriptional gene silencing down regulates gene expression through guiding target RNA degradation or repression of translation [3, 4] ."
Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for the COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on SARS- CoV immunological studies,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. : bioRxiv preprint B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A six-year follow-up study.","The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) (C.

Mouse hepatitis virus nsp14 exoribonuclease activity is required for,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian 23 species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans. CoVs encode several 24 innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate 25 efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' 26 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for 27 high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses 28 that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates.

Chronic infections can shape epidemic exposure: Pathogen co-occurrence networks in the Serengeti lions,"Pathogens are embedded in a complex network of microparasites that can collectively or individually alter disease dynamics and outcomes. Chronic pathogens, for example, can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating morbidity and mortality.","Identifying and determining the nature of species interactions of multiple pathogens within hosts is increasingly considered critical to understanding infectious disease dynamics (e.g., Pedersen & Fenton 2007; Johnson et al. 2015; Seabloom et al. 2015; Fountain-Jones et al. 2018) . Individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection dynamics (Cattadori et al. 2008; Susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (Moss et al. 2008; Munson et al. 2008; Wejse et al. 2015) . Pathogens that form chronic, long-lasting infections are ubiquitous and are likely to overlap pathogens that produce short-lasting acute infections (Fenton 2008; Randall et al. 2013; Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Aivelo & Norberg 2018) . Chronic pathogens can compete for the same resources as acute pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (Randall et al. 2013; Budischak et al. 2018) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g., Geldmacher & Koup 2012) ."
Contesting the evidence for -1 frameshifting in immune-functioning C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) -the HIV-1 co-receptor 2,"During the decoding of a subset of mRNAs a proportion of ribosomes 8 productively shift to the -1 reading frame at a specific, slippage-prone site 1 . While the 9 great majority of occurrences of the ""Programmed -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting"" (-1 10 PRF) involve viruses 2 , other mobile elements or retroelements 1 , a dramatic instance of 11 utilized human cellular -1 frameshifting in a non-retroelement derived mRNA has been 12 reported. The mRNA for which -1 frameshifting was claimed due to a stimulatory 13 pseudoknot is that which encodes immune functioning C-C chemokine receptor 5 14 (CCR5), the HIV-1 co-receptor 3 . The publication ascribed the importance of the reporter 15 CCR5 mRNA frameshifting directing translating ribosomes to a premature termination 16 codon leading to mRNA destabilization via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway 17 (NMD), rather than creating a C-terminally unique peptide. The same lab estimates that 18 up to 10% of eukaryotic genes may be regulated by this frameshift-NMD mechanism 4 19 and point to the potential for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating disease by -1 20 PRF 5 . Efficient -1 frameshifting requires a slippery site together with an appropriately 23 positioned stimulatory RNA structure. The reported CCR5 slip site (U_UUA_AAA where 24 underscores set of the reading frame) has previously been shown to facilitate high 25 levels of -1 frameshifting in vitro when positioned 5' of a known stimulatory pseudoknot 6 . 26 However, frameshifting efficiencies in vivo could be substantially different and further, at 27 least as of 2016, there were no known virus frameshift sites with the reported CCR5 28 shift site 1 . 29 30 We challenge the reported results by showing that frameshifting at the relevant 31 CCR5 sequence cassette does not occur above background levels and that the claimed 32 pertinent sequence is not as distinctively conserved as previously presented.

Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm,"The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.

Clinical characterization and chest CT findings in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients. Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I 2 -statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result.","The results based on clinical and CT-scan symptoms are presented in table.1.

Remote control of neural function by X-ray-induced scintillation,"Scintillators exhibit visible luminescence, called scintillation, when irradiated with X-rays. Given that X-rays penetrate through biological tissues, X-ray-induced scintillation would enable remote optogenetic control of neural functions at any depths in the brain. Here we show that a yellow-emitting inorganic scintillator, Ce-doped Gd3(Al,Ga)5O12 (Ce:GAGG), can effectively activate red-shifted excitatory and inhibitory opsins. Using these scintillator-opsin combinations, we successfully activated and inhibited midbrain dopamine neurons of freely moving mice by X-ray irradiation, producing bi-directional modulation of place preference behavior. The Ce:GAGG crystal was biocompatible and could be implanted for a long period without progressive neuroinflammatory responses. Neither brain injury nor behavioral dysfunction was acutely induced by radiation during the behavioral tests. Thus, X-ray-induced scintillation allows wireless control of cellular functions in living animals, expanding X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine.","We first sought opsins that could be effectively activated by the PL of Ce:GAGG. DNA plasmids encoding different opsins were transfected into HEK 293 cells and photocurrents induced by PL illumination were measured (Fig. 1C) . For depolarizing opsins, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ) elicited the largest photocurrents in cells expressing the red-shifted opsin bReaChES (13) (340.3 ± 43.1 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1D ). Regarding inhibitory opsins, the anion channelrhodopsin GtACR1 (14) showed the strongest activation (627.2 ± 80.2 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1E ) in response to the PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ). PL-irradiation of GFP-expressing cells induced undetectable currents (Fig. 1 , D and E). Thus, Ce:GAGG PL can activate red-shifted opsins that are used for optogenetic control of neurons. Furthermore, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG could also induce significant activation of enzyme rhodopsin BeGC1 (15) (fig. S3 ), suggesting that the scintillation of Ce:GAGG can be used for activation of various light-sensitive proteins."

Bayesian mixture analysis for metagenomic community profiling,"Deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures. The work is implemented as a user friendly R package, available from CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaMix .","Metagenomics can be defined as the analysis of a collection of DNA or RNA sequences originating from a single sample. In practice, its scope is broad and includes the analysis of a diverse set of samples such as gut microbiome (Qin et al., 2010) , (Minot et al., 2011) , environmental (Mizuno et al., 2013) or clinical (Willner et al., 2009) , (Negredo et al., 2011 ), (McMullan et al., 2012 samples. Among these applications, the discovery of viral pathogens is clearly relevant for clinical practice (Fancello et al., 2012) , (Chiu, 2013) . The traditional process of characterizing a virus through potentially difficult and time consuming culture techniques is being revolutionized by advances in high throughput sequencing. Potential benefits of sequence driven methodologies include a more rapid turnaround time (Quail et al., 2012) , combined with a largely unbiased approach in species detection, including the opportunity for unexpected discoveries."
Vaccination with single plasmid DNA encoding IL-12 and antigens of 2 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus elicits complete 3 protection in IFNAR knockout mice Republic of Korea Author summary 57,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease 34 caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high 35 mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we 36 developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together 37 with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-38 like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to 39 enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of 40 IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid 41 without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against 42 surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, 43 as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in 44 protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein 45 immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens 46 induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in 47 relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, 48 both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to 49 induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, 50 optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and 51 incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine 52 development.","leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia [3, 4] .

Even though the majority of SFTS cases has been reported from 89 China [3] , Korea [4] , and Japan [5] , SFTSV infections in southern Asia, including Vietnam, 90 have been recently reported in a retrospective survey [6] . Currently, no specific viral therapy 91 nor vaccine is available. An effective vaccine is needed to combat its relatively high mortality, 92 especially in elderly patients, and spread of SFTSV between humans [7, 8] . 93 Vaccine development for SFTS is at an early discovery phase and there have only been a few 94 studies on vaccine candidates using animal infection models [8] [9] [10] [11] .

They clearly showed that a 106 single dose rVSV carrying SFTSV Gn/Gc could provide complete protection against lethal 107 challenge with SFTSV in young and old IFNAR KO mice, a promising infection model for 108 severe human infection of SFTSV [11, 13, 14] . Nevertheless, the potential role of cellular 109 immunity against the viral antigens in complete protection was not examined in this study, 110 although adoptive transfer of immune sera from mice immunized with rVSV-Gn/Gc to naïve 111 IFNAR KO mice provide partial (~ 60%) protection against lethal SFTSV challenge [11] . 112 In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA (pSFTSV) encoding extracellular 113 domains of Gn and Gc, and NP-NS fusion antigen as a DNA vaccine candidate. We 114 examined whether it could provide protective immunity against lethal SFTSV infection in 115 IFNAR KO mice. In order to facilitate the processing and presentation of the SFTSV antigens 116 by dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance antigen-specific T cell responses, these recombinant 117 antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) [15, 16] . Moreover, we 118 generated a recombinant DNA encoding IL-12 and  in addition to the recombinant viral 119 antigens (pSFTSV-IL12) to further enhance cell-mediated immunity [17] . Vaccination of 120 pSFTSV-IL12 provided complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV 121 challenge, whereas immunization with pSFTSV elicits only partial protection, indicating that 122 antigen-specific cellular immune responses enhanced by co-expression of IL-12 could play a 123 significant role in protection against lethal SFTSV infection. We confirmed significantly 124 higher levels of Gn and NP-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in mice vaccinated with 125 pSFTSV-IL12 when compared to those in mock vector-immunized mice.

Highly ACE2 Expression in Pancreas May Cause Pancreas Damage After SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 in humans, began to occur in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and has the trend of spreading around the world [1, 2, 3] . By February 28, 2020, a total of 78962 people had been infected in China with 2791 (3.53%) deaths, and 4838 people had been infected with 76 (1.57%) deaths in other countries. It was confirmed by etiology that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the novel coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), and had 79.5% similarity with SARS-CoV [4] , which caused the global outbreak in 2003. Spike (S) protein, one of the main structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein of the host cell membrane to fuse into the cell for nucleic acid replication just similar to SARS-CoV [5] . Through a variety of bioinformatics and experimental verification, ACE2 is not only expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, but also in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, testis and other organs, which means that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to enter other tissues and organs through ACE2 binding, causing multiple organ damage [6, 7] ."
Estimating the daily trend in the size of the COVID-19 infected population in Wuhan,"There has been an outbreak of coronavirus disease in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China since December 2019. Cases have been exported to other parts of China and more than 20 countries. We provide estimates of the daily trend in the size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on detailed information of 10,940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province.","More than 500 cases have been detected outside China. Despite the considerable medical resources and personnel that have been dispensed to combat COVID-19 in Hubei province, hospital capacity continues to be overburdened. There continues to be a shortage of hospital beds needed to accommodate the rising number of COVID-19 patients. In response to this growing crisis, Wuhan plans to transform hotels, venues, training centers and college dorms into quarantine and treatment centers for COVID-19 patients. Further, 13 mobile cabin hospitals will be built to provide over 10,000 beds. [2] Therefore, a careful and precise understanding of the potential number of cases in Wuhan is crucial for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. Wu et al. (2020) provided an estimate of the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, using the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China. [3] However, since the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China is small, their estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan may not be precise and has large variability.

In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan.","A novel coronavirus pneumonia, initially identified in Wuhan, Central China and now named as 2019-nCoV [1] , has surged in the public. As from late January 2020, authorities had reported more than 6,000 confirmed cases across nearly all provinces in mainland China and confirmed over 130 deaths. Globally, more than 13 countries or regions have reported confirmed cases including domestic cases. With the increasing incidence of confirmed cases, corresponding spread control policies and emergency actions are taking place."
Innate Immune Priming by cGAS as a Preparatory Countermeasure Against 1 RNA Virus Infection 2 3,"The detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system. Notably, RNA virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors, thereby activating 29 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, 30 recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also 31 protects against RNA viruses.

FastViromeExplorer: A Pipeline for Virus and Phage Identification and Abundance Profiling in Metagenomics Data,"Identifying viruses and phages in a metagenomics sample has important implication in improving human health, preventing viral outbreaks, and developing personalized medicine. With the rapid increase in data files generated by next generation sequencing, existing tools for identifying and annotating viruses and phages in metagenomics samples suffer from expensive running time. In this paper, we developed a standalone pipeline, FastViromeExplorer, for rapid identification and abundance quantification of viruses and phages in big metagenomic data. Both real and simulated data validated FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large data, as well as in a time efficient manner.","Identifying the kinds of viruses that infect eukaryotes and prokaryotes (phages) and understanding their functions are important because they are the most abundant entities on Earth [18] . Even in a healthy human body, there are estimated to be 100 times more viral particles than eukaryotic cells [7] . Studies have shown that there are connections between human gut microbiome (viruses and bacteria) and diseases such as diabetes [6] and depression [8] and cancer [31] . Moreover, recent emerging viral outbreaks including Zika outbreak in Brazil [3] , Ebola in West Africa [4, 9] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [10] , SARS, influenza-A caused tens of thousands of human deaths. To better understand and eventually prevent such viral outbreaks, it is critical to have timely identification and annotation of viruses. Traditional techniques of virus identification rely on isolation and clone culturing, which is not only time-consuming but often infeasible as many viruses and their hosts are difficult to cultivate in laboratories. Thanks to the fast development of biotechnology, it is now easy and quick to produce metagenomics data for a direct analysis of genetic materials to identify viruses and their abundances in various environments [11] ."
Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by Reverse Transcription- Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples.","The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has generated global concern given its rapid spread in multiple countries and possible fatal progression of the infection. Initially, many patients reported exposure at a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China, suggesting animal-to-person transmission of the virus. However, since then many patients have reported no exposure to animal markets, indicating that person-to-person transmission is occurring. There is currently no vaccine or targeted therapeutic for COVID-19."
Estimation of the final size of the COVID-19 epidemic,"In this short paper, the logistic growth model and classic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamic model are used to estimate the final size of the coronavirus epidemic.","The logistic growth model originates from population dynamics (Haberman 1998) . The underlying assumption of the model is that the rate of change in the number of new cases per capita linearly decreases with the number of cases. Hence, if C is the number of cases, and t is the time, then the model is expressed as"
Prophage genomics reveals patterns in phage genome organization and replication,"Temperate phage genomes are highly variable mosaic collections of genes that infect a bacterial host, integrate into the host's genome or replicate as low copy number plasmids, and are regulated to switch from the lysogenic to lytic cycles to generate new virions and escape their host. Genomes from most Bacterial phyla contain at least one or more prophages. We updated our PhiSpy algorithm to improve detection of prophages and to provide a web-based framework for PhiSpy. We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts' translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43% of the prophages). The integrase was routinely located at either end of the integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably conserved throughout phage evolution.","Phages are major drivers in global biogeochemical cycles through the control they exert on bacterial populations. Despite their abundance in the environment they are under-represented in sequence databases and knowledge-bases. Phages' two life cycles, the lytic and lysogenic cycles, provide a unique window into phage genomics. During the lysogenic cycle, temperate phages integrate their genomes into their host's genome in a non-lethal fashion to generate a region of DNA known as a prophage -either as a plasmid (1) or by directly recombining with the host's genome (2, 3) . The phage replicates in the host genome until external signals promote a transition to the lytic cycle, at which point the phage hijacks the host's cellular DNA replication machinery in order to replicate the phage genome, and adopts the host's protein synthesis machinery to create new phage particles. Eventually the phage lyse releases infective particles to find new hosts to attack."
"Human, Nonhuman Primate, and Bat Cells Are Broadly Susceptible 1 to Tibrovirus Particle Cell Entry 2 3 Running Title: 3/5 words",32,"Recently, the coding-complete BAV genome sequence (13,296 nt) was determined (Lauck et To further understand which cell types tibrovirus particles may enter and in which cell 133 types authentic tibroviruses may replicate, we exposed 53 human, 11 bat, 7 nonhuman primate, 1 134 hispid cotton rat, 1 boa constrictor, and 1 Asian tiger mosquito cell lines to newly established 135 infectious recombinant vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses (rVSIVs) encoding the eight diverse 136 tibrovirus Gs and to four authentic tibroviruses (BAV, CPV, SWBV, and TIBV). The obtained 137 rVSIV infections rates, which reflect tibrovirus particle cell entry (host cell susceptibility), 138 indicate that particles of all tibroviruses, not only those of BASV, easily enter a broad range of 139 human and non-human cells. We confirm pH dependency of BASV G-mediated entry, show that 140 tibrovirus particle cell entry is likely dynamin-dependent and cholesterol-independent, and 141 extrapolate these findings to all tibroviruses. Using the four authentic tibroviruses and cross-142 reacting anti-tibrovirus N antibodies in western blots, we demonstrate, however, that many cell 143 lines that are susceptible to tibrovirus G-mediated particle entry are not likely to be permissive to 144 replication of most tibroviruses after particle entry.

Extensive programmed ribosomal frameshifting in human as revealed by a massively parallel reporter assay,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the controlled slippage of the translating ribosome to an alternative frame. This tightly regulated process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV and SARS-CoV and is critical for their life cycle and virulence. It is also utilized throughout the tree of life to implement a feedback control mechanism to regulate polyamine levels. However, despite its universality and clinical relevance, a limited number of studies investigated this process on only a few selected examples, largely due to a lack of experimental means. Here, we developed a highthroughput, fluorescence-based approach to assay the frameshifting potential of a sequence. We designed and tested >12.000 sequences based on 15 viral and human frameshifting events, allowing us to elucidate the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting in a systematic way and to discover novel regulatory features. We also utilized our approach to search for novel frameshifting events and identified dozens of previously unknown frameshifting sites in human, showing that programmed ribosomal frameshifting is more common than previously anticipated. We assessed the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing >500 clinical isolates and identified subtypespecific differences as well as associations between viral load in patients and the optimality of gagpol frameshifting rates. We further devised a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts frameshifting rates of novel variants (up to r=0.70), including subtle differences between HIV isolates (r=0.44), providing a basis for the development of antiviral agents acting on programmed ribosomal frameshifting. author/funder.

It allows for an expansion of the proteome but also constitutes an additional regulatory layer to fine-tune gene expression (Advani and Dinman, 2016; Dinman, 2012; Ketteler, 2012) . This mechanism is widespread and indispensable in viruses, which often utilize controlled slippage of the ribosome to an alternative frame to regulate the production of key enzymes, such as in the case of the gag-pol frameshift in HIV and other retroviruses. This is a strikingly robust and precise process with minimal variability (Dulude et al., 2006; Hung et al., 1998) , which might explain why viruses rely on it rather than other means of posttranscriptional and translational control for crucial regulatory switches. The importance of maintaining the stoichiometry between structural proteins encoded by the gag gene and enzymes encoded by the pol gene for viral replicative success make the gag-pol frameshifting event a promising antiviral drug target (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Hung et al., 1998) ."

Identification of quercetin from fruits to immediately fight Zika,"Zika virus is spread mainly by the bite of an infected mosquito, which can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, thus leading to birth defects including more than microcephaly. It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika in the near future, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the key role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication.","Zika virus was originally isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 (1) , which is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes.

Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of nosocomial infection and explain the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020.

ACE2 Expression in Kidney and Testis May Cause Kidney and Testis Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection,"In December 2019 and January 2020, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, and has already posed a serious threat to public health. ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.","Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] .

To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 -4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.","SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV, is a novel coronavirus (CoVs) isolated from patients with pneumonia in China 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a similar incubation period (median, 3.0 days) and a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (1), but it is estimated that the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV (2) ."
The host antiviral ribonuclease L protein supports Zika virus replication 3 factory formation to enhance infectious virus production 4 5,"The flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) activates ribonuclease L (RNase L) catalytic antiviral 26 function during infection, yet deletion of RNase L decreases ZIKV production, suggesting 27 a proviral role of RNase L.

First evidence of host range expansion in virophages and its potential impact on giant viruses and host cells,"Virophages are satellite-like double stranded DNA viruses whose replication requires the presence of two biological entities, a giant virus and a protist. In this report, we present the first evidence of host range expansion in a virophage. We demonstrated that the Guarani virophage was able to spontaneously expand its viral host range to replicate with two novel giant viruses that were previously nonpermissive to this virophage. We were able to characterize a potential genetic determinant of this cross-species infection. We then highlighted the relevant impact of this host adaptation on giant viruses and protists by demonstrating that coinfection with the mutant virophage abolishes giant virus production and rescues the host cell population from lysis. The results of our study help to elucidate the parasitic lifestyle of virophages and their interactions with giant viruses and protists. author/funder. All rights reserved.

This parameter is predicted to play a determinant role in virus pathogenicity, maintenance in nature and epidemiology 2 . Some viruses have evolved the capacity to expand their host range by biologically adapting to novel hosts. This phenomenon is known as host range expansion and requires the selection of specific mutations that enable a given viral species to replicate in a novel host 3 . In bacteriophages, such host range mutations target mostly the genes encoding the viral tail and baseplate involved in attachment to a receptor at the host cell surface 4, 5 ."
DEN-IM: Dengue Virus identification from shotgun and targeted metagenomics,"Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health and economic burden in affected countries.

Therapeutic Drugs Targeting 2019-nCoV Main Protease by High-Throughput Screening,"2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in Wuhan, China. Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.","Since December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, China. Genome sequencing of samples from these patients confirmed that the culprit of these infections was a beta-coronavirus that has never been reported before, which was later named as 2019-nCoV [1, 2] . By Jan 28, 2020, more than 4500 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV, and nearly 100 patients were died from the infection.

DNA-scaffolded biomaterials enable modular and tunable control of cell-based cancer immunotherapies,"Advanced biomaterials provide versatile ways to spatially and temporally control immune cell activity, potentially enhancing their therapeutic potency and safety. Precise cell modulation demands multi-modal display of functional proteins with controlled densities on biomaterials. Here, we develop an artificial immune cell engager (AICE) platform -biodegradable particles onto which multiple proteins are densely loaded with ratiometric control via short nucleic acid tethers. We demonstrate the impact of AICE with varying ratios of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on ex vivo expansion of human primary T cells. We also show that AICE can be used to control the activity of engineered T cells in vivo. AICE injected intratumorally can provide a local priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate chimeric antigen receptor T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors that model potentially cross-reactive healthy tissues. This modularly functionalized biomaterial thus provides a flexible platform to achieve sophisticated control over cell-based immunotherapies.","avoid ""on-target, off-tumor"" toxicity in bystander healthy tissues 28 , CAR-T cells have been engineered with combinatorial antigen AND-gate activation control that requires sensing two antigens on a target cell to initiate killing.

The 2019-new coronavirus epidemic: evidence for virus evolution,"There is concern about a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans. author/funder.

,"Profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks. We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences, and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and identify touching points and temporal pathways that are candidates for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.","How far a virus will eventually spread at local, regional, national and international levels is of central concern during an epidemic outbreak due to the severe consequences large-scale epidemics have on human well-being [5] , the stability and coherence of social systems [11] , and the global economy [23] . A thorough understanding of the genetic characteristics of a virus is crucial to understand the way it is (or may be) transmitted (e.g. human-to-human transmissibility) in order to be able to anticipate the potential reach of an outbreak and develop effective countermeasures. The recent outbreak of a new type of coronavirus -2019-nCoV -provides plenty of examples of the way researchers seek to quickly approach the aforementioned problems of genetic decomposition of the virus [2, 8] and modelling of its transmission dynamics [15] ."
Enhanced replication of mouse adenovirus type 1 following virus-induced degradation of protein 3 kinase R (PKR) 4 5 Running Title: MAV-1 degrades PKR during infection 6 7,word count: 225 22 Importance word count: 144 23 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a,"Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection 25 by sensing dsRNA produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the 26 translation factor eIF2α, halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting 27 PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These 28 include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here 29 we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus 30 type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at a transcriptional or 31 translational level because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to 32 polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the 33 proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the 34 lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR 35 degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicate that the degradation 36 occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR 37 degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together these results suggest that 38 an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR 39 activity, and it has only been described in six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first 40 example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it. 41 42 Importance 43"
Zika virus infection in Collaborative Cross mice 1 2,"The 2015-2016 emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, and recognition that ZIKV 15 infection during pregnancy can result in birth defects, revealed a need for small animal models to 16 study ZIKV pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals. Mice would 17 be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it 18 fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies 19 have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1 -/or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking 20 antibodies).

Predicting the global mammalian viral 1 sharing network using phylogeography,"Understanding interspecific viral transmission is key to understanding viral ecology and evolution, 12 disease spillover into humans, and the consequences of global change. Prior work has 13 demonstrated that macroecological factors drive viral sharing in some mammalian groups, 14 but analyses have never attempted to predict viral sharing in a pan-mammalian context. Here 15 we show that host phylogenetic similarity and geographic range overlap are strong, nonlinear 16 predictors of viral sharing among species across the entire mammal class. Using these traits, 17 we predict global viral sharing patterns across 4196 mammal species and show that our 18 simulated network successfully predicts viral sharing and reservoir host status using internal 19 validation and an external dataset. We predict high rates of mammalian viral sharing in the 20 tropics, particularly among rodents and bats, and that within-and between-order sharing 21 differs geographically and taxonomically. Our results emphasize the importance of 22 macroecological factors in shaping mammalian viral communities, and provide a robust, 23 general model to predict viral host range and guide pathogen surveillance and conservation 24 efforts.","Most emerging human viruses originate in wild mammals, so understanding the drivers of 27 interspecific viral transmission in these taxa is an important public health research priority 1,2 . 28 Despite a rapidly expanding knowledge base, the mammalian viruses known to science 29 remain taxonomically biased and limited in scope, likely comprising less than 1% of the 30 complete mammalian virome 3,4 . Furthermore, host range is inadequately characterized even 31 for the best-studied viruses 5-7 . To help prioritise viral discovery efforts and zoonotic disease 32 surveillance in wildlife, studies have revealed high (zoonotic) parasite diversity in certain 33 host taxa, such as rodents and bats 5, 8 , and/or linked parasite diversity with host phenotypic 34 traits such as reproductive output 9,10 . Viral diversity has also been associated with host 35 macroecological traits, including geographic range size 11 and sympatry with other mammals 5 . 36 The rationale for investigating viral diversity is that species with more viruses will generate 37 more opportunities for viral transmission to other species, including humans. However, in 38 order to infect a new host species, a virus must transmit, invade, and potentially replicate 39 within the novel host 12 . Each of these processes becomes less likely if the two hosts differ 40 more in terms of their geographic range, behaviour, and/or biochemistry (i.e., cellular 41 receptors allowing viral attachment and invasion) 12, 13 . Consequently, the probability that a 42 pair of hosts will share a virus is shaped both by the species' underlying viral diversity and by 43 species interactions represented by pairwise measures such as spatial overlap, phylogenetic 44 relatedness, and ecological similarity [14] [15] [16] . 45 "
PLANT-Dx: A Molecular Diagnostic for Point of Use Detection of Plant Pathogens,"Synthetic biology based diagnostic technologies have improved upon gold standard diagnostic methodologies by decreasing cost, increasing accuracy, and enhancing portability. However there has been little effort in adapting these technologies towards applications related to point-of-use monitoring of plant and crop health. Here, we take a step towards this vision by developing an approach that couples isothermal amplification of specific plant pathogen genomic sequences with customizable synthetic RNA regulators that are designed to trigger the production of a colorimetric output in cell-free gene expression reactions. We demonstrate our system can sense viral derived sequences with high-sensitivity and specificity, and can be utilized to directly detect viruses from infected plant material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the entire system can operate using only body heat and naked-eye visual analysis of outputs. We anticipate these strategies to be important components of user-friendly and deployable diagnostic systems that can be configured to detect a range of important plant pathogens.","Synthetic biology has recently contributed to multiple advances in point-of-use nucleic acid diagnostic (PoUD) technologies (1) . These technologies leverage isothermal strategies to amplify target nucleic acids, with new advances in detection of these targets using stranddisplacement (2) , or CRISPR-based methods (3, 4) that produce fluorescent readouts, or RNA toehold switches that control translation of enzymes that produce colored compounds (5) . Overall these technologies can be used for sensitive detection of pathogen-derived nucleic acids in complex matrices in field-deployable formats that significantly improve upon current laboratory-intensive PCR-based approaches."

ΦX174 Attenuation by Whole Genome Codon Deoptimization,"Natural selection acting on synonymous mutations in protein-coding genes influences genome composition and evolution. In viruses, introducing synonymous mutations in genes encoding structural proteins can drastically reduce viral growth, providing a means to generate potent, live attenuated vaccine candidates. However, an improved understanding of what compositional features are under selection and how combinations of synonymous mutations affect viral growth is needed to predictably attenuate viruses and make them resistant to reversion. We systematically recoded all non-overlapping genes of the bacteriophage ΦX174 with codons rarely used in its E. coli host. The fitness of recombinant viruses decreases as additional deoptimizing mutations are made to the genome, although not always linearly, and not consistently across genes. Combining deoptimizing mutations may reduce viral fitness more or less than expected from the effect size of the constituent mutations and we point out difficulties in untangling correlated compositional features. We test our model by optimizing the same genes and find that the relationship between codon usage and fitness does not hold for optimization, suggesting that wild-type ΦX174 is at a fitness optimum. This work highlights the need to better understand how selection acts on patterns of synonymous codon usage across the genome and provides a convenient system to investigate the genetic determinants of virulence. : bioRxiv preprint host-phage relationships that are too short-lived for selection to fine tune codon usage in the phage, or inadequate understanding of the features under selection.","The unequal use of synonymous codons is known as codon usage bias (1) .

A PREPRINT,"On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R 0 , to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.","On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China [1] .

"Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China School of Public Health (","The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests.

This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.
The Impact of Host-Based Early Warning on Disease Outbreaks,"The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals' recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown.","The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks often relies on health care professionals' recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms can potentially improve both patient care and public health responses. An example of such an early warning system is the PRESAGED (Presymptomatic Agent Exposure Detection) system [1] which uses host-based physiological signals to detect an individual's exposure to pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, before overt symptoms emerge and infectiousness is peak. In animal models, the PRESAGED algorithm has been shown to provide two to three days of early warning before the onset of incipient symptoms (e.g., fever), independent of the particular pathogen, exposure route, pathogen dose, or animal species [1] . These results are consistent with findings of Speranza et al. that show presymptomatic upregulation in biomarkers potentially linked to pathogen exposure around the same time in non-human primates exposed to Ebola [2] . Numerous efforts have evaluated epidemiological models to characterize the disease transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of public health interventions of past outbreaks [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , including effort by Chowell et al [14] that examines the impact of a hypothetical early diagnostic capability (based on advancements in bioassay tests) for containing the spread of Ebola. We posit that a comprehensive simulation capability is essential for assessing the potential impact of a host-based early warning system."
Prodrug defiance reveals logic-based strategies for treating bacterial resistance,"Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanismswhich include resistance, persistence and tolerancewe propose defiance as a subclass of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. Using locked antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that are activated by bacterial 5 proteases as a prototypic prodrug, we observe that although treatment eliminates bacteria across the vast majority of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, concentration of growth nutrients), bacteria spontaneously switch from susceptibility to defiance under conditions that alter the competing rates between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation. To identify the determinants of this switch-like behavior, we model bacteria-prodrug dynamics as a multi-rate 10 feedback system and identify a dimensionless quantity we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that perfectly classifies bacteria as either defiant or susceptible across a broad range of treatment conditions. By recognizing that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance behaves analogously to electronic transistors, we construct prodrug logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to allow assembly of an integrated 3-bit multi-prodrug circuit that kills defiant bacteria 15 under all possible combinations of BAH values (i.e., 000, 001, …, 111) that represent a broad range of possible treatment conditions. Our study identifies a form of bacterial resistance specific to prodrugs that is described by a predictive dimensionless constant to reveal logic-based treatment strategies using multi-prodrug biological circuits.","The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria coupled with the lack of newly developed antibiotics has created a serious public health threat 1, 2 . Understanding the causes of antibiotic failure inspires the development of new drugs and informs clinical treatment strategies [3] [4] [5] . These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria. Discriminating between these survival strategies employed by bacteria is crucial for the development of new drugs and clinical treatment decisions 6 . 15"
Estimating the risk on outbreak spreading of 2019-nCoV in China using transportation data,"A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence.","On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia infections in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China [1] . The cause of the pneumonia was later identified as a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genetically very closely related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARSCoV) [2] . This marks the third time in 20 years that a member of the family of coronaviruses (CoVs) has caused an epidemic employing its zoonotic potential, for example, from bats [3] . The novel virus was able to establish between person-to-person transmission [4] ."
Early Prediction of Disease Progression in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Patients Outside Wuhan with CT and Clinical Characteristics,"Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP."
Increased Neurite Orientation-Dispersion and Density in the TgCRND8 Mouse Model of Amyloidosis: Inverse Relation with Functional Connectome Clustering and Modulation,"Extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposits and inflammatory immune activation are thought to alter various aspects of tissue microstructure, such as extracellular free water, fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, as well as the density and geometric arrangement of axonal processes.","Excess production and oligomerization of the β-amyloid (Aβ) protein, the main constituent of amyloid plaques, substantially modifies neuronal morphology (Biscaro et al., 2009; Spires and Hyman, 2004) . Important, Aβ alters neuronal homeostasis and synaptic plasticity by modifying the extracellular environment of neuronal soma, axons, and synapses (Mueggler et al., 2004; Sykova et al., 2005) . Aβ is implicated in the formation of dystrophic 'neurites' (Sadleir et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2009) , deficits in synaptic plasticity and excitability (Cummings et al., 2015; Varga et al., 2015) , cell membrane protein aggregation (Shrivastava et al., 2017) , reduced integrity of major fiber tracts (Mayo et al., 2017; O'Dwyer et al., 2011; Teipel et al., 2014) and impaired activity in resting state networks (Hedden et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2016) . In addition, Aβ is immunogenic (Dalgediene et al., 2013) , leading to the increased activated microglia in the brain (Mirzaei et al., 2016; Serriere et al., 2015) . Positron emission tomography (PET) studies using microglia-or Aβspecific radiotracers provide compelling evidence of an overlapping presence of activated microglia and amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease (Kreisl et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Mirzaei et al., 2016; Parbo et al., 2017; Schuitemaker et al., 2013) . For instance, a longitudinal study identified a transient elevation in microglia early in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which peaked later in Alzheimer's disease (Fan et al., 2017) . Aged transgenic mice expressing familial Alzheimer's mutations to amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 with deletion of exon-9 (APP/PS1dE9) had higher in vivo cortical and hippocampal accumulation of an activated microglial-targeted radiotracer, 18kD translocator protein (TSPO), than aged wildtype or young Tg mice (Liu et al., 2015) . Taken together, the above findings strongly suggest that accrual of Aβ plaques and concomitant reactive microgliosis may underlie pathologic dysfunction in Alzheimer's by causing deleterious changes to brain parenchymal microstructure. In this study, we asked the question whether we can utilize high field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantitatively assess amyloid pathology and immune-related mechanisms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and establish their mechanistic links with intrinsic brain activity measured by resting state functional MRI (fMRI) (Brown et al., 2018) ."

"Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province, China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data",The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 continues to expand across the world.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is rapidly expanding across the world and presents a significant public health emergency with the potential of becoming pandemic. 1 As of March 1, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 60 countries. In early stages of epidemics with emerging pathogens, real-time analysis of accurate and robust epidemiological and clinical data is essential to developing interventional strategies and guiding public health decisionmaking. 2, 3 Such data can provide insight into infectivity, routes of transmission, disease severity, and outcomes, thus enabling epidemiologic modelling and improved public health responses. 4, 5 Line list data, which includes individual patient-level data on important epidemiological and clinical variables, is rarely available early during an outbreak with a novel pathogen. 5 However, recognizing the utility of such data and its ability to provide for real-time analyses, multiple academic groups have been curating line list data using crowdsourcing and openly sharing the data with the scientific community. 4, 5 Crowdsourcing enables the collection of data from multiple platforms including health-care-oriented social networks, government and public health agencies, and global news sources."
A practical generation interval-based approach to inferring the strength of epidemics from their speed Keywords Infectious disease modeling; Generation interval; basic reproductive number 1,"Infectious-disease outbreaks are often characterized by the reproductive number R and exponential rate of growth r. R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size. Directly estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval -the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r-R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.","Infectious disease research often focuses on estimating the reproductive number, i.e., the number of new infections caused on average by a single infection. This number is termed the reproductive number -R. The reproductive number provides information about the disease's potential for spread and the difficulty of control. It is described in terms of an average [4] or an appropriate sort of weighted average [9] ."
Antipsychotic behavioral phenotypes in the mouse Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred inter-crosses (RIX),"Schizophrenia is an idiopathic disorder that affects approximately 1% of the human population, and presents with persistent delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behaviors.","Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs (SAHA et al. 2007; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 2008; LAURSEN et al. 2012; CLOUTIER et al. 2016) . Onset typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood with the emergence of a number of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior (AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. 2013) . Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, but as much as 75% of patients discontinue assigned treatments due to side effects and/or inefficacy over relatively short periods of time (LIEBERMAN et al. 2005) . Deciphering the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics could eventually allow the development of predictive algorithms, such that physicians could predict which patients are prone to develop side effects or less likely to achieve a therapeutic response. Advances in this arena could lead to safer and more efficacious therapeutic interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia."

Viral gain-of-function experiments uncover residues under diversifying selection in nature,"Viral gain-of-function mutations are commonly observed in the laboratory; however, it is unknown whether those mutations also evolve in nature. We identify two key residues in the host recognition protein of bacteriophage l that are necessary to exploit a new receptor; both residues repeatedly evolved among homologs from environmental samples.","populations. Indeed, some researchers have called for the suspension of virus gain-of-function laboratory experiments 13 on the grounds that they would tell us little about real-world viral evolution at the risk of constructing viral strains that are pandemic to new hosts. Here, we use a harmless virus, bacteriophage l, to demonstrate how gain-of-function experiments can identify mutations that mimic those that occur in nature: we find that two amino acid residues that are critical for gain of function in the laboratory recurrently evolve in nature."
Large-scale analysis of redox-sensitive conditionally disordered protein regions reveal their widespread nature and key roles in high-level eukaryotic processes,"Recently developed quantitative redox proteomic studies enable the direct identification of redox-sensing cysteine residues that regulate the functional behavior of target proteins in response to changing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the molecular level, redox regulation can directly modify the active sites of enzymes, although a growing number of examples indicate the importance of an additional underlying mechanism that involves conditionally disordered proteins. These proteins alter their functional behavior by undergoing a disorder-to-order transition in response to changing redox conditions. However, the extent to which this mechanism is used in various proteomes is currently unknown. Here, we use a recently developed sequence-based prediction tool incorporated into the IUPred2A web server to estimate redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions on a large scale. We show that redox-sensitive conditional disorder is fairly widespread in various proteomes and that its presence strongly correlates with the expansion of specific domains in multicellular organisms that largely rely on extra stability provided by disulfide bonds or zinc ion binding. The analyses of yeast redox proteomes and human disease data further underlie the significance of this phenomenon in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, as well as its biomedical importance.","The key to the extraordinary versatility of proteins lies in their specific structural properties that precisely suit their individual functions. For example, enzymes typically need to adopt a welldefined conformation that ensures the correct orientation of their active site residues, as required for optimal catalytic activity. In contrast, intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDPs/IDRs) lack a well-defined structure in isolation, and are best characterized by an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations [1] . The specific structural properties of IDPs enable them to carry out a different set of functions, which could not be fulfilled by relatively rigid globular domains [2, 3] . As a result, the function of many IDPs directly originates from their high intrinsic flexibility, enabling them to act as linkers or spacers [3, 4] . However, there is an emerging understanding that the structural behaviour of IDPs is often context-dependent: a disorder-to-order or order-to-disorder transition can be induced as a result of binding to specific macromolecular partners, undergoing post-translational modifications, or changes in environmental factors such as pH and temperature [5] . Recently, redox conditions have emerged as another important factor that can regulate conditional disorder [6] . The growing number of examples of redox-regulated conditionally disordered proteins indicates that this is an important mechanism triggered in response to various forms of oxidative stress or to naturally occurring changes in redox potential [6, 7] ."
Transgenic mice expressing tunable levels of DUX4 develop characteristic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy-like pathophysiology ranging in severity Title: FSHD-like transgenic mouse models of varying severity,"Background: All types of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) are caused by the aberrant myogenic activation of the somatically silent DUX4 gene, which initiates a cascade of cellular events ultimately leading to FSHD pathophysiology. Therefore, FSHD is a dominant gain-of-function disease that is amenable to modeling by DUX4 overexpression. However, there is large variability in the patient population. Typically, progressive skeletal muscle weakness becomes noticeable in the second or third decade of life, yet there are many genetically FSHD individuals who develop symptoms much later in life or remain relatively asymptomatic throughout their lives. Conversely, in rare cases, FSHD may present clinically prior to 5-10 yrs of age, ultimately manifesting as a very severe early onset form of the disease. Thus, there is a need to control the timing and severity of pathology in FSHD-like models. Methods: We have recently described a line of conditional DUX4 transgenic mice, FLExDUX4, that develop a myopathy upon induction of human DUX4-fl expression in skeletal muscle. Here, we use the FLExDUX4 mouse crossed with the skeletal muscle-specific and tamoxifen inducible line ACTA1-MerCreMer to generate a highly versatile bi-transgenic mouse model with chronic, lowlevel DUX4-fl expression and mild pathology, that can be induced to develop more severe FSHD-like pathology in a dose-dependent response to tamoxifen. We identified conditions to reproducibly generate models exhibiting mild, moderate, or severe DUX4-dependent pathophysiology, and characterized their progression. Results: We assayed DUX4-fl mRNA and protein levels, fitness, strength, global gene expression, histopathology, and immune response, all of which are consistent with an FSHD-like myopathic phenotype. Importantly, we identified sex-specific and muscle-specific differences that should be considered when using these models for preclinical studies. Conclusions: The ACTA1-MCM;FLExDUX4 bi-transgenic mouse model expresses a chronic low level of DUX4-fl and has mild pathology and detectable muscle weakness. The onset and progression of moderate to severe pathology can be controlled via tamoxifen injection to provide consistent and readily screenable phenotypes for assessing therapies targeting DUX4-fl mRNA and protein. Thus, these FSHD-like mouse models can be used to study a range of DUX4-fl expression and pathology dependent upon investigator need, through controlled mosaic expression of DUX4.","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) afflicts females and males of all ages and an estimated 1:8,300-15,000 people world-wide [1] [2] [3] [4] .

Epigenetic dysregulation of the locus is caused by large deletions of the D4Z4 array on a single 4q allele, reducing it to 1-10 repeat units (RU) (classified as FSHD1) [6, 11, 12] , or by mutations in genes encoding repressive epigenetic regulators of the locus (classified as FSHD2) [13, 14] . In addition, all forms of FSHD require a permissive DUX4 polyadenylation signal (PAS) in cis distal to a dysregulated chromosome 4q D4Z4 array [15] ."

Imaging Striatal Dopamine Release Using a Non-Genetically Encoded Near-Infrared Fluorescent Catecholamine Nanosensor,"Neuromodulation plays a critical role in brain function in both health and disease. New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. These nIRCat nanosensors may be advantageous for future use because i) they do not require virus delivery, gene delivery, or protein expression, ii) their near-infrared fluorescence facilitates imaging in optically scattering brain tissue and is compatible for use in conjunction with other optical neuroscience tool sets, iii) the broad availability of unique near-infrared colors have the potential for simultaneous detection of multiple neurochemical signals, and iv) they are compatible with pharmacology.","The catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine are neuromodulators known to play an important role in learning and attention and are implicated in multiple brain disorders. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Dopamine, in particular, is thought to play a critical role in learning 6 , motivation 7, 8 , and motor control 9 , and aberrations in dopamine neurotransmission are implicated in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease 10 , schizophrenia 11 , and addiction. 12 Neuromodulatory neurotransmission is thought to occur on a broader spatial scale than classic neurotransmission, which is largely mediated by synaptic release of the amino acids glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In synaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, neurotransmitter concentrations briefly rise in the synaptic cleft to mediate local communication between the pre-and postsynaptic neurons through the rapid activation of ligand-gated ion channels. 13 In contrast, neuromodulators (catecholamines, neuropeptides) may diffuse beyond the synaptic cleft and act via extrasynaptically-expressed metabotropic receptors. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Thus, modulatory neurotransmitter activity extends beyond single synaptic partners and enables small numbers of neurons to modulate the activity of broader networks. 20 The absence of direct change in ionic flux across cell membranes, which is measurable using available tools like electrophysiology or genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), has necessitated the use of methods borrowed from analytical chemistry such as microdialysis and amperometry to study the dynamics of neuromodulation. However, spatial limitations of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and spatial and temporal limitations of microdialysis currently make it difficult to interpret how neuromodulators affect the plasticity or function of target neural populations at behaviorally relevant spatiotemporal scales."
Domestication reprogrammed the budding yeast life cycle,"population. We report that domestication of the model yeast S. cerevisiae reprogrammed its life cycle entirely. We tracked growth, gamete formation and cell survival across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced isolates and found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. Wild yeasts near uniformly trigger meiosis and sporulate when encountering nutrient depletions, whereas domestication relaxed selection on sexual reproduction and favoured survival as quiescent cells. Domestication also systematically enhanced fermentative over respiratory traits while decreasing stress tolerance. We show that this yeast domestication syndrome was driven by aneuploidies and gene function losses that emerged independently in multiple domesticated lineages during the specie's recent evolutionary history. We found domestication to be the most dramatic event in budding yeast evolution, raising questions on how much domestication has distorted our understanding of this key model species.","Humans have domesticated plant and animal species over at least 12000 years to improve agricultural traits. Domestication greatly contributed to human population expansion and development by releasing labour from food production, but also profoundly altered the domesticated species. Controlled breeding and artificial selection on the segregating genetic diversity created plant and animal crops that now differ drastically from those of their ancestors and wild relatives 1 . Selected traits recur across domesticated species 2 and, due to pleiotropy and linkage, often come with specific, non-desired side-effects. Human-created niches may also impose quasi-domestication and unintentionally favour some traits and genetic variants with side-effects linked to them 3 . Both domestication and quasidomestication therefore results in suites of co-evolving traits, known as domestication syndromes 4, 5 ."

Influenza A virus surface proteins are organized to help penetrate host mucus,"Influenza A virus (IAV) enters cells by binding to sialic acid on the cell surface. To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how 15 the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating an organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the 20 virus's conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, and could contribute to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV. 35","For a virus to infect a cell, it must reach receptors on the cell surface while avoiding neutralization or clearance by 'decoy' receptors in the surrounding environment. For viruses that bind to sialic 25 acid, a receptor that is abundant both on the surface of cells and in the secreted extracellular mucosal environment, attachment and detachment is controlled by receptor-binding and receptordestroying activities on the viral surface (Rosenthal et al., 1998; Zeng et al., 2008) . Influenza A viruses (IAVs), respiratory pathogens that contribute to seasonal flu and have pandemic potential, achieve this balance with hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated receptor binding and neuraminidase 30 (NA)-catalyzed receptor destruction (Air and Laver, 1989; Skehel and Wiley, 2000) . Although the importance and genetic basis of the functional balance between HA and NA in IAV has been thoroughly characterized (Wagner et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2011) , it is becoming clear that transmissibility of influenza viruses within and between hosts depends on factors beyond the sequence of these two genes (Chou et al., 2011; Herfst et al., 2012; Neumann and unable to stably attach to the surface of the underlying epithelial cells once it is reached. Adaptations that helps the virus to overcome both of these conflicting challenges, such as changes in virus morphology or a particular spatial organization of envelop proteins, could be evolutionarily favored during in vivo replication."
Recombinant vector vaccines and within-host evolution 1,"Many recombinant vector vaccines are capable of replication within the host. They consist of a 5 fully competent vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the 6 perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be intrinsically 7 detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete the transgene may evolve to dominate the within-8 host population and in doing so reduce the antigenicity of the vaccine. We apply mathematical and 9 computational models to study this process, including the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth 10 plus the dynamics of innate and adaptive immunity. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is 11 easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that, despite possible 12 fitness differences between vaccine and revertant, the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the 13 short period of growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant per se does not 14 interfere with immunity to vaccine except as the revertant suppresses vaccine abundance; the magnitude 15 of this interference depends on mechanisms and timing of viral suppression. Adaptive immunity targeting 16 the foreign antigen is also a possible basis of vaccine inferiority, but it is not worsened by vaccine evolution.","Revertant Vaccine (Antigen threshold) Figure 1 : Independent growth of vaccine (blue) and revertant (green). The revertant virus has the superior growth rate, but in the absence of interference between the two, vaccine growth is unimpeded and immunity is triggered. growth and thereby suppresses antigen production. 103 The challenges are thus to understand (i) when and how much vaccine evolution occurs; (ii) whether and to 104 what extent that evolution affects the abundance of vaccine virus; and (iii) the extent to which change in the 105 vaccine abundance affects the generation of adaptive immunity against the antigen. The arguments presented 106 above are qualitative and only superficially identify the scope of the problem. Quantitative understanding 107 ultimately rests on analysis of mathematical models. However, as the models have many interacting processes 108 -minimally innate immunity, adaptive immunity and intrinsic growth differences between vaccine versus inferiority. Yet even if vaccine selective 'neutrality' turns out to be fleeting, merely a mistaken impression 119 from short-term observations, we will find that the phenomenon of short-term stability mirrors a solution to 120 minimize vaccine evolution within the host. infections [26] [27] [28] [29] . The relative role of each mechanism in clearing infections is the basis of ongoing discussion, 145 but it is widely accepted that the roles differ among infections by different viruses and that each mechanism 146 is potentially important for some viruses. Adaptive immunity. 165 Adaptive immunity can be induced by the wild-type vector and the vaccine virus. Adaptive immune responses 166 specific to antigens expressed by the wild-type vector will presumably affect the vaccine and revertant equally 167 -because the vaccine encodes a complete vector genome, and the revertant is also a complete vector. As with 168 the preceding pair of mechanisms, adaptive immunity common to both revertant and vaccine will operate so 169 that revertant abundance will depress vaccine. Adaptive immunity to the vaccine antigen will be considered 170 shortly. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/545087 doi: bioRxiv preprint one mechanism may take precedence over the others, simply because it is activated earlier or enforces a lower 173 limit on viral density than the others. However, there are different stages or degrees of vaccine suppression, 174 so an early mechanism may act to control the infection without clearing it, and another mechanism may 175 act later to clear. Because of the delay in developing an adaptive response, viral suppression by adaptive 176 immunity typically occurs later than effects of innate immunity or resource limitation and so might seem 177 to be unimportant in vaccine evolution. Yet adaptive immunity may be important in clearing the vaccine 178 following control by other mechanisms, in which case it could have an important role in vaccine evolution. The preceding paragraphs omitted adaptive immunity to the antigen. By its very nature, adaptive immunity 182 suppresses vaccine growth. But adaptive immunity to the antigen is specific to the vaccine and is thus 183 another reason -besides intrinsic fitness effects -that the vaccine may have lower fitness than revertant."
Title: Modelling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship using,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020. We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), and thus timely actions were crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.","The coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019, and spread to over 40 foreign countries in a short period of time [1] [2] [3] .

The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","history, and timelines of reporting changes to identify early shifts in the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, from an epidemic driven by frequent importations to local transmission."
National and Regional Influenza-Like-Illness Forecasts for the USA,"Health planners use forecasts of key metrics associated with influenza-like-illness (ILI); near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.","Basic model 98 The DICE package has been designed to implement meta-population epidemic modeling 99 on an arbitrary spatial scale with or without coupling between the regions. Our model 100 for coupling between spatial regions follows ref [24] . We assume a system of coupled 101 S-I-R equations (susceptible-infectious-recovered) for each spatial region. In this 102 scenario, the rate at which a susceptible person in region j becomes infectious (that is 103 transitions to the I compartment in region j) depends on: (1) the risk of infection from 104 those in the same region j, (2) the risk of infection from infected people from region i 105 who traveled to region j, and (3) the risk of infection encountered when traveling from 106 region j to region i.

Identification of a Novel Base J Binding Protein Complex Involved in 2 RNA Polymerase II Transcription Termination in Trypanosomes 3 Short Title: PNUTS-PP1 Regulates Transcription Termination in T,"19 Base J, β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA 20 Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how 21 specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription 22 termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-23 glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass 24 spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein 25 (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate 26 JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, 27 JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian 28 PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. 29 Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of 30 PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3'-end of polycistronic gene arrays in 31 Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of promoters, 32 suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In 33 addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes important for 34 host immune evasion. Our results provide the first direct mechanistic link between base J and regulation 35 of Pol II termination and suggest a novel molecular model for the role of the CTD of Pol II in terminating 36 polycistronic transcription in trypanosomatids. 37 38 Author Summary 39 Trypanosoma brucei is an early-diverged parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping 40 sickness in humans.

"Robitaille et al. 1 DUSP1 regulates apoptosis and cell migration, but not the JIP1-protected cytokine response, during Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Sendai Virus infection","The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the Pneumoviridae family of large enveloped negative-sense ssRNA viruses that includes important human pathogens 1, 2 . RSV is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections associated with morbidity and mortality in infants, children and elderly, but also adults of all-age with a compromised immune system, cardiopulmonary diseases or following transplantation 3, 4 . The capacity of the host to mount an appropriate antiviral defense aimed at limiting virus replication and spreading is critical to determine the outcome of the infection. As a consequence, the inability of the host to sustain an antiviral response leads to failure in eradicating the infection. Conversely, uncontrolled duration or intensity of the response is harmful to the host and is associated with the development of virus-associated pathogenesis, chronic inflammatory diseases and various autoimmune diseases 5, 6 . Therefore, these responses need to reach the ideal intensity and duration for efficient fighting of the infection while limiting tissue damage and promote tissue repair 7 . To this aim, the various components of the host antiviral defense, including the transcriptional induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, such as apoptosis, are subjected to stringent regulation by both positive and negative mechanisms 8,9 . Upon virus entry and sensing by the cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), the mitochondrial membrane-associated adaptor (MAVS) coordinates multiple signalling pathways ultimately leading to the activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factors (IRF) 3/7, Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) and Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) [10] [11] [12] .

Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak,"The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.","Circulating in China and 94 other countries and territories, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in 103,168 confirmed cases including 22,355 outside mainland China, with 3,507 deaths reported (March 7, 2020). Due to its increasing threat to global health, WHO has declared that the COVID-19 epidemic was a global public health emergency. The causative pathogen of the COVID-19 outbreak has been identified as a highly infectious novel coronavirus which is referred to as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] [2] [3] The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is thought to be via at least 3 sources: 1) inhalation of liquid droplets produced by and/or 2) close contact with infected persons and 3) contact with surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. 4 Moreover, aerosol transmission of pathogens has been shown in confined spaces. 5, 6 There are many respiratory diseases spread by the airborne route such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox. 7, 8 A retrospective cohort study conducted after the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 suggested that airborne spread may have played an important role in the transmission of that disease. 9 At present, there is little information on the characteristics of airborne SARS-CoV-2 containing aerosols, their concentration patterns and behaviour during airborne transmission due to the difficulties in sampling virus-laden aerosols and challenges in their quantification at low concentration. Such a lack of understanding limits effective risk assessment, prevention and control of COVID-19 disease outbreaks. This study on airborne SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in different areas inside two hospitals and public areas in Wuhan, China, the epicenter city during the initial disease outbreak. We aimed to 1) quantify the concentrations of airborne SARS-CoV-2 both inside the hospitals and in outdoor public areas, 2) evaluate the aerodynamic size distributions of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols that may mediate its airborne transmission, and 3) determine the dry deposition rate of the airborne SARS-CoV-2 in a patient ward room."
The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope-based Vaccine Designing against COVID-19,Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, which is surrounded by crownshaped, club-like spikes projection on the outer surface [1] [2] . Coronaviruses spike protein are glycoprotein that are embedded over the viral envelope. This spike protein attaches to specific cellular receptors and initiates structural changes of spike protein, and causes penetration of cell membranes which results in the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell [3] . The viral spike protein includes N-terminal, which is crucial for identification of Coronaviruses [4] . Coronaviruses have a large RNA genome in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases and capable of obtaining distinct ways of replication [5] . Like all other RNA viruses, coronavirus undergoes replication of genome and transcription of mRNAs upon infection. Synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA serves as template for full-length genomic RNA [3] [6] . Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [7] . that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [8] . This group of viruses can cause wide varieties of respiratory illness in mammals and birds. In human, it causes common cold, leading to severe illness pneumonia to elderly people and immunocompromised people, like hospital patients [9] .

Evaluation of Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Colloidal Gold- Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for Detection of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia (COVID-19),"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited.

The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG).

"ADJUSTED AGE-SPECIFIC CASE FATALITY RATIO DURING THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC IN HUBEI, CHINA","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic that originated in Wuhan, China has spread to more than 60 countries. We estimated the age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) by fitting a transmission model to data from China, accounting for underreporting of cases and the time delay to death. Overall CFR among all infections was 1.6% (1.4-1.8%) and increased considerably for the elderly, highlighting the expected burden for populations with further expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic around the globe.","As of 2 March 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic that originated in Wuhan, China, has affected more than 60 countries and resulted in 88,948 confirmed cases and 3,043 deaths globally [1] . The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be similar to those of pandemic influenza and will likely facilitate further global spread [2] . During this early phase of a potential pandemic, it is critically important to obtain reliable estimates of the overall case fatality ratio (CFR), i.e., the proportion of all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected cases that will die as a result of the disease. Such estimates will help anticipate the expected morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and provide critical information for the planning of health care systems in countries that face an epidemic."
Title: Metagenomic Sequencing Detects Respiratory Pathogens in Hematopoietic Cellular Transplant Patients Running Title: mNGS Detects Respiratory Pathogens in HCT Patients,"Commentary: Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of death in hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients, but the microbiologic etiology of these infections is frequently unknown. The limits of current diagnostics preclude targeted antimicrobial treatments, resulting in excess morbidity and mortality. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing may enable precision diagnosis of respiratory infections in hematopoietic cellular transplant patients by simultaneously detecting microbial pathogens, transcriptional biomarkers of the host response, and the pulmonary microbiome. This approach may facilitate targeted antimicrobial prescription and provide a new method for distinguishing infectious and non-infectious post-transplant respiratory illness. ABSTRACT RATIONALE: Current microbiologic diagnostics often fail to identify the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in hematopoietic cellular transplant recipients (HCT), which precludes the implementation of targeted therapies. OBJECTIVES: To address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we evaluated the utility of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to detect microbial pathogens in HCT patients with acute respiratory illnesses. METHODS: We enrolled 22 post-HCT adults ages 19-69 years with acute respiratory illnesses who underwent BAL at the University of Michigan between January 2012 and May 2013. mNGS was performed on BAL fluid to detect microbes and simultaneously assess the host transcriptional response. Results were compared against conventional microbiologic assays. MEASUREMENTS & MAIN RESULTS: mNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detecting respiratory microbes (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus) when compared to standard testing.","Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a leading reason for hospitalization and mortality in hematopoietic cellular transplant (HCT) recipients (1, 2) . This problem is underscored by autopsy studies showing that previously undetected pulmonary pathogens may contribute to death in 30% of HCT recipients (3, 4) . Despite this, the etiologic pathogens remain unidentified in most cases of LRTI, due largely to the limitations of current microbiologic tests in terms of sensitivity, speed and breadth of assay targets (5) ."

Error patterns in connected speech Stark et al Neural organization of speech production: A lesion-based study of error patterns in connected speech,"While numerous studies have explored single-word naming, few have evaluated the behavioral and neural correlates of more naturalistic language, like connected speech, which we produce every day. Here, in a retrospective analysis of 120 participants at least six months following left hemisphere stroke, we evaluated the distribution of word errors (paraphasias) and associated brain damage during connected speech (picture description) and object naming. While paraphasias in connected speech and naming shared underlying neural substrates, analysis of the distribution of paraphasias suggested that lexicalsemantic load is likely reduced during connected speech. Using voxelwise lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), we demonstrated that verbal (real word: semantically related and unrelated) and sound (phonemic and neologistic) paraphasias during both connected speech and naming loaded onto the left hemisphere ventral and dorsal streams of language, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time using both connected speech and naming data, we localized semantically related paraphasias to more anterior left hemisphere temporal cortex and unrelated paraphasias to more posterior left temporal and temporoparietal cortex. The connected speech results, in particular, highlight a gradient of specificity as one translates visual recognition from left temporo-occipital cortex to posterior and subsequently anterior temporal cortex. The robustness of VLSM results for sound paraphasias derived during connected speech was notable, in that analyses performed on sound paraphasias from the connected speech task, and not the naming task, demonstrated significant results following removal of lesion volume variance and related apraxia of speech variance. Therefore, connected speech may be a particularly sensitive task on which to evaluate further lexical-phonological processing in the brain. The results presented here demonstrate the related, though different, distribution of paraphasias during connected speech, confirm that paraphasias arising in connected speech and single-word naming likely share neural origins, and endorse the need for continued evaluation of the neural substrates of connected speech processes.","Much of what we know about the neural architecture of language production is grounded in studies of single word retrieval (Levelt, 1999; Foygel and Dell, 2000; Walker and Hickok, 2016) . To successfully retrieve a word, such as the name of an object, one must access at least three levels of information: conceptual (what it is), lexical (its associated word) and phonological (the sounds to select and organize). When we describe a situation, however, we do not simply name objects. Instead, we select two or three words per second from an active vocabulary spanning an estimated 40,000 words (Levelt, 1989) , and making this feat more complex, our word selection is vulnerable to ""competition"" from multiple sources. For example, errors in connected speech tend to be phonologically or semantically related word substitutions or omissions, the replacement of the intended target word with a word that we intended to use in a future production, or the perseveration on a word that was used recently (Lashley, 1951; Garrett, 1975) . Selecting a word in connected speech, therefore, requires a delicate balance of target word activation and suppression of alternatives, where alternatives come in the form of previously selected forms, subsequent forms in various stages of planning, and similar competitor forms, all coordinated across multiple hierarchical levels."
MAD1 domains in the mitotic checkpoint Coordination between discrete Mitotic Arrest Deficient 1 (MAD1) domains is required for efficient mitotic checkpoint signaling,All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.,"As a sensitive signaling system, the mitotic checkpoint ensures faithful chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase onset when even a single kinetochore is unattached. The key signal amplification reaction for the checkpoint is the conformational conversion of open MAD2 (O-MAD2) into closed MAD2 (C-MAD2). The reaction was suggested to be catalyzed by an unusual catalyst, a MAD1:C-MAD2 tetramer, but how the catalysis is executed and regulated remains elusive. Here we report that in addition to the wellcharacterized middle region (MIM), both aminoand carboxyl-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of MAD1 also contribute to the mitotic checkpoint. In contrast to MIM that stably associates with C-MAD2, MAD1-NTD and CTD surprisingly bind to both O-MAD2 and C-MAD2, suggesting their interactions with substrates and products of the O-C conversion. MAD1-NTD also interacts with CTD. MPS1 kinase interacts with and phosphorylates both NTD and CTD. The phosphorylation reduces the NTD:CTD interaction and CTD interaction with MPS1. Mutating CTD phosphorylation sites including Thr716 compromises MAD2 binding and the checkpoint responses. Ser610 and Tyr634 also contribute to the checkpoint. Our results have uncovered previously unknown interactions of MAD1-NTD and CTD with MAD2 conformers and their regulation by MPS1 kinase, providing novel insights into the mitotic checkpoint signaling. _______________________________________ The mitotic checkpoint is a crucial signal transduction pathway that contributes to faithful chromosome segregation (1) (2) (3) (4) . A single unattached kinetochore delays anaphase onset, underscoring the importance of signal amplification for the mitotic checkpoint (5) . The conversion of MAD2 from open (O-MAD2) to closed (C-MAD2) conformation is a well-recognized signal amplification mechanism for the mitotic checkpoint (6, 7) . O-MAD2 is the predominant conformer in interphase cells (8, 9) . During prometaphase intracellular C-MAD2 concentration is increased to promote formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which binds and inhibits the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (1) (2) (3) (4) . In the current model, the MAD2 O-C conversion is catalyzed by a 2:2 MAD1:C-MAD2 tetramer localized at unattached kinetochores, whereby cytoplasmic O-MAD2 hetero-dimerizes with the C-MAD2 moiety in the catalyst and morphs into C-MAD2 through unknown mechanism but possibly involving some intermediate folding states (I-MAD2) (6, 7, 10) ."
Using heterogeneity in the population structure of U.S. swine farms to compare transmission models for porcine epidemic diarrhoea,"In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.","The 2013 emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) 1 in the United States has provided an example of both the economic hardships livestock diseases can cause and our limited understanding of how such diseases spread. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), the causative agent, acutely infects the intestine and causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting. 2 Currently, the earliest known U.S. outbreak occurred in April, 3 and in less than a year PED outbreaks were confirmed in 27 states, 4 states that unweaned pigs. 3 The time it takes for a farm to return to stable production is highly variable but on the order of weeks, leading to great expenses in infection control costs and production losses alike."
Clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19: a retrospective review of medical records in a single medical center,"confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.","The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease, which was occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (1). It is reported that the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings has been accumulating (2-4). The patients' common clinical manifestations included fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (5) . Chen et al reported that mortality of COVID-19 was 4.3%, and severe cases (treated in the ICU) were older, more likely to have underlying comorbidities, dyspnea and anorexia (4) .

COVID-19 in Wuhan: Immediate Psychological Impact on 5062 Health Workers,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.","At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The rapid escalation of COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a World Health Organization (WHO)-declared public health emergency of international concern. The global total number of COVID-19 cases has been several times that of SARS, and the death toll has also exceeded that of SARS 1 . As the source area of COVID-19 epidemic, Wuhan has the majority of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Nowadays, information is spreading more rapidly and extensively than it was in 2003 when SARS broke out, which might exacerbate public fear, panic, and distress. Frontline health workers (HWs) were saving lives while encountering an increasing workload and risk of infection. In the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, it was reported that infected HWs accounted for 29 percent of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients 2 . Also, quarantined frontline HWs might be facing potential social isolation, and unquarantined HWs experiencing social discrimination. Therefore, they are susceptible to complex emotional reactions and psychological distress 3 . Furthermore, the mental health problems of HWs would impair their attention, cognitive functioning, and clinical decision-making 4, 5 , consequently increase the occurrence of medical errors and incidents, and ultimately put patients at risk. It was also well known that acute stress in disasters could have a lasting effect on the overall wellbeing [6] [7] [8] . Hence, the mental health problems of HWs in COVID-19 epidemic have become an urgent public health concern."
Quantitative Delineation of Herpesviruses in Bats for use in Ecological Studies,"Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts. With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or ""species"", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts. Lipkin WI (2013) A strategy to estimate unknown viral diversity in mammals. mBio 4: e00598-13.","Public health concerns associated with recent and ongoing outbreaks of viruses (e.g., Ebola virus and Zika virus) have motivated researchers to investigate viral diversity in wildlife hosts from previously unexplored perspectives. Ecology has a long history of quantifying the abundance and distribution of organisms and has been increasingly integrated into viral studies (Anthony et al. 2015 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . Traditionally, such efforts have focused on isolated cases of single host-single pathogen relationships (Telfer et al. 2010) . However, infected host individuals generally have multiple pathogens, and infection with one pathogen can affect infection, virulence, or disease emergence of the others (Pedersen and Fenton 2006 , Jolles et al. 2008 , Telfer et al. 2010 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . This suggests that perspectives and approaches from community ecology can complement current methods in virology."
Anti-biofilm Activity of Graphene Quantum Dots via Self-Assembly with Bacterial Amyloid Proteins,"Bacterial biofilms represent an essential part of Earth's ecosystem that can cause multiple ecological, technological and health problems. The environmental resilience and sophisticated organization of biofilms are enabled by the extracellular matrix that creates a protective network of biomolecules around the bacterial community. Current anti-biofilm agents can interfere with extracellular matrix production but, being based on small molecules, are degraded by bacteria and rapidly diffuse away from biofilms. Both factors severely reduce their efficacy, while their toxicity to higher organisms create additional barriers to their practicality. In this paper we report on the ability of graphene quantum dots to effectively disperse mature Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, interfering with the self-assembly of amyloid fibers -a key structural component of the extracellular matrix. Mimicking peptide-binding biomolecules, graphene quantum dots form supramolecular complexes with phenol soluble modulins, the peptide monomers of amyloid fibers. Experimental and computational results show that graphene quantum dots efficiently dock near the N-terminus of the peptide and change the secondary structure of phenol soluble modulins, which disrupts their fibrillation and represents a novel strategy for mitigation of bacterial communities.","Most microorganisms survive in the form of biofilms -structurally and functionally sophisticated microbial communities. Biofilms are implicated in numerous technological problems from water membrane failures to airplane crashes 1,2 as well as in various diseases from persistent infections to cancer 3, 4 . Biofilms also form a large component of the ecosphere on Earth and their dysregulation can also cause significant ecological consequences. 5 Biofilms act like multicellular organisms and possess exceptional adaptability and resilience to environmental factors and pharmaceuticals. 6, 7 Both of these properties are afforded by the protective function of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is made from several types of biomolecules (i.e., polysaccharides, DNA, and peptides). 8, 9 To date only a few classes of compounds have been shown to be effective anti-biofilm agents. 10, 11 Peptides rich in amino acids such as proline, arginine, phenylalanine or tryptophan have shown broad-spectrum activity in killing bacteria within biofilms by targeting a universal stringent stress response in bacteria. 12 However, they are currently being developed only as antibiotic adjuvants because they are subject to rapid proteolytic degradation and are relatively expensive to synthesize. Small molecules have been used to inhibit the quorum sensing (QS) system 13 or interfere with the polymerization of amyloid proteins. 14 While further exploration of these strategies of biofilm inhibition need to be explored, the rapid loss of the small molecules due to diffusion into environment reduce their efficacy and increase their environmental toxicity."

Insufficiency in airway interferon activation defines clinical severity to infant RSV infection. Running Title: Airway IFN Signaling in RSV Infection,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease in infants. Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses. All rights reserved.

Genome-wide Prediction of microRNAs in Zika virus Genomes Reveals Possible Interactions with Human Genes Involved in the Nervous System Development,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae. In 2015, ZIKV triggered a large epidemic in Brazil and spread across Latin America. In November of that year, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae, whose natural transmission cycle involves mainly vectors from the Aedes genus, while humans are occasional hosts [1] . Clinical manifestations of disease caused by ZIKV range from asymptomatic cases to an influenza-like syndrome associated to fever, headache, malaise and cutaneous rash [2] . ZIKV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 10,800 nt in length [3] . Although ZIKV enzootic activity was reported in diverse countries of Africa and Asia, few human cases were reported until 2007, when a large epidemic took place in Micronesia [4] . A large ZIKV outbreak occurred in French Polynesia during 2013-2014 and then spread to other Pacific islands [5] . In early 2015, a ZIKV epidemic outbreak took place in Brazil, currently estimated at 440,000-1,300,000 cases [6] . In November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak [7] .

Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity,"Germline variation at immunoglobulin gene (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete reference sequences in these regions is problematic because of segmental duplications and somatically rearranged source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.","Antibodies are essential components of the immune system that play key roles in processes associated with innate and adaptive immunity 1 . They are expressed by B-cells as either cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, and are formed by two pairs of identical ""heavy"" and ""light"" immunoglobulin (IG) protein chains, encoded by genes located at three primary loci in the human genome: the IG heavy chain (IGH) at 14q32.33, and the two IG light chain regions, lambda (IGL) and kappa (IGK), located at 22q11.2 and 2p11.2 2 . Specifically, through a unique mechanism referred to as V-(D)-J recombination 3 , individual Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes at the IGH locus, and V and J genes at either the IGK or IGL loci recombine somatically at the DNA level to generate templates for the subsequent transcription and translation of antibody heavy and light chains, respectively. V-(D)-J recombination is accompanied by the random addition and deletion of nucleotides at the junctions of the combined V, D, and J genes by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). The extreme variability observed in expressed antigen-naïve B-cell antibody repertoires is due to this combinatorial and junctional diversity, and partly ensures that the immune system is able to recognize and mount effective immune responses against a diverse range of potential pathogens. At the population and species level, IG haplotype and allelic variation also make important contributions to the diversity of expressed antibody repertoires [4] [5] [6] [7] ; however, broader roles of IG genetic polymorphism in antibody function are generally less well understood 8 ."
Full Title: A systematic review of MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) 2 seroprevalence and viral RNA prevalence in dromedary camels: implications for animal vaccination,"Human infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is driven by 28 recurring dromedary-to-human spill-over events, leading decision-makers to consider dromedary 29 vaccination. Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, 30 but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed 31 to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We systematically reviewed the published 32 literature reporting seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary 33 populations from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, including 60 studies in our qualitative 34 syntheses. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries 35 supporting geographically wide spread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian 36 Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection 37 measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further 38 investigation -particularly of dromedary movement -and inform vaccination strategy design. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 .

The dromedary population is highly heterogeneous and 68 spans a wide geographic area stretching from West Africa through to the Middle East and parts of 69 Asia. Knowing when and where dromedaries would need to be targeted, and the likely impact of 70 vaccination, is necessary before further consideration of dromedary vaccination in the wider 71 socioeconomic and cultural context. 72 Here, we systematically reviewed published studies that measured MERS-CoV antibody 73 seroprevalence in dromedaries and/or prevalence of viral RNA in dromedaries. Assuming assay 74 specificity and long-term presence of antibodies after infection, seroprevalence can be used to 75 estimate what proportion of a dromedary population has ever been infected with MERS-CoV. Broken 76 down by age class, this can tell us when most animals encounter the infection for the first time. 77 Additionally, although whole-virus isolation and culture is necessary to confirm whether the shedding .

Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection,"A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure. : bioRxiv preprint rise of liver enzymes, implying liver function damage in patients infected with MERS-CoV [9].","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, temporally named as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] .

Ruler elements in chromatin remodelers set nucleosome array spacing and phasing,"Arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes dominate chromatin and are often phased by alignment to reference sites like active promoters. How the distances between nucleosomes (spacing), and between phasing sites and nucleosomes are determined remains unclear, and specifically, how ATP dependent chromatin remodelers impact these features. Here, we used genome-wide reconstitution to probe how Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP dependent remodelers generate phased arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes. We find that remodelers bear a functional element named the 'ruler' that determines spacing and phasing in a remodeler-specific way. We use structure-based mutagenesis to identify and tune the ruler element residing in the Nhp10 and Arp8 modules of the INO80 remodeler complex. Generally, we propose that a remodeler ruler regulates nucleosome sliding direction bias in response to (epi)genetic information. This finally conceptualizes how remodeler-mediated nucleosome dynamics determine stable steady-state nucleosome positioning relative to other nucleosomes, DNA bound factors, DNA ends and DNA sequence elements.","Arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes dominate chromatin and are often phased by alignment to reference sites like active promoters.

Designing Effective small interfering RNA for Post-Transcriptional Silencing of Human GREM1: A Comprehensive Bioinformatics Approach,"Human gremlin-1 is a physiologically versatile signaling molecule that has been associated with several human diseases including cancer. The ability of gremlin-1 to induce fibrosis in organs and transduce angiogenesis makes it a target for cancer therapy. RNAi-based therapy has proven to be very efficient and specific in tumor growth inhibition. The efficacy and specificity of siRNA-mediated gene silencing depends on the designing approaches. Here, empirical guidelines for siRNA design and comprehensive target site availability analysis were used to select effective siRNA from a plethora of potential candidates designed using several computation algorithms. Then, the selected siRNA candidates were subjected to stringent similarity searches in order to obtain siRNA candidates with reduced off-target effects (high specificity). The best candidates were compared to experimentally successful gremlin-1 siRNAs in order to predict the silencing potency of the selected siRNAs. siRNA-6 (sense strand: 5'-CCAAGAAAUUCACUACCAU-3'), siRNA-7 (sense strand: 5'-CCAUGAUGGUCACACUCAA-3') and siRNA-47 (sense strand: 5'-GGCCCAGCACAAUGACUCA-3') were predicted to be highly effective siRNA candidates for gremlin-1 silencing. These siRNAs can be considered for RNAi-based therapy because off-target effects are predicted to be minimal.","GREM1, located on human chromosome 15q13→q15, is the gene that codes for gremlin-1."

As viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, organisms evolved innate immune processes for 5 the sensing and the restriction of viruses. Among the processes involved is RNA and DNA editing mediated by endogenous deaminases. Two different deaminase families are present in mammalian species: the ADARs target double stranded RNA (dsRNA) for deamination of Adenines into Inosines (A-to-I) (3, 4) , and the APOBECs deaminate Cytosines into Uracils (C-to-U) on singlestranded nucleic acids (ssDNA and ssRNA) (5, 6) . ADARs interfere with viral infections directly 10 -through hypermutation of viral RNA-and indirectly, through modulation of the intracellular response (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . On the other hand, APOBECs target the viral genome, typically DNA intermediates (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , either through C-to-U hypermutation or through a non-enzymatic path that interferes with reverse transcription (21, 22) . Some APOBEC3 proteins can interfere in vitro with Coronaviridae replication, yet it is not clear whether their enzymatic activity is involved (23) . 15 Eventually though, both of these restriction systems are exploited by the viruses themselves to increase their evolutionary potential (24) (25) (26) ."
Early epidemiological analysis of the 2019-nCoV outbreak based on a crowdsourced data,"As the outbreak of novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) progresses within China and beyond, there is a need for rapidly available epidemiological data to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies.

Teicoplanin potently blocks the cell entry of 2019-nCoV,"Since December 2019, the outbreak of a new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, has greatly threatened the public health in China and raised great concerns worldwide. No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC 50 of 1.66 μM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.","The coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA The spike glycoprotein (S protein) is the leading mediator of viral entry, and the important determinant of host range of coronaviruses 18 .

It very 29 urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential 30 total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based 31 regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 32 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well 33 fitted with the Boltzmann function (R 2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of 34 confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) 35 as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 36 16092), respectively.

An amino acid motif in HLA-DRβ1 distinguishes patients with uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Uveitis is a visually-debilitating disorder that affects up to 30% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). To identify genetic susceptibility loci for uveitis in JIA, we conducted a genome-wide association study comparing 192 JIA-associated uveitis cases with 330 JIA individuals without uveitis. Two cohorts of JIA patients underwent genotyping and quality control. We used an HLA-specific imputation panel to impute HLA-specific amino acids and HLA types, and identified the amino acid serine at position 11 (serine-11) in HLA-DRB1 as associated to increased risk of uveitis (OR = 2.60, p = 5.43 x 10 -10 ). The signal at serine-11 was female-specific (interaction of sex and serine-11, p = 0.0096). Serine-11 resides in the YST-motif (positions 10-12) in the peptide binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Quantitative binding affinity predictions revealed peptide-binding preferences that distinguish HLA-DRB1 allotypes with the YST-motif. Our findings highlight a genetically distinct, sexually-dimorphic feature of JIA-associated uveitis.","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood, 1,2 affecting approximately 16-150 per 100,000 individuals. 3 As many as 1 in 3 children that suffer from the most common JIA categories, oligoarticular and polyarticular rheumatoid factor-negative JIA, develop uveitis, a chronic inflammatory eye disease, which is the most frequent extra-articular manifestation of JIA. 4, 5 Uveitis threatens the sight of those affected, and can result in complications including macular edema, band keratopathy, cataracts, glaucoma, and hypotony. 4 Because it typically afflicts the young (<7 years old), uveitis dramatically impacts quality of life both in childhood and as an adult. 4, 6 Early detection and adequate ophthalmological management of JIA-associated uveitis are critical to prevent significant, sight-threatening complications. [7] [8] [9] Despite its severity, uveitis is typically insidious in onset and often becomes symptomatic only after irreversible damage has occurred. Consequently, rigorous ophthalmological screening of all JIA patients is required for early detection and treatment of uveitis associated with JIA. 10 Nonetheless, severe ocular complications may already be present at the time of a uveitis diagnosis. Several clinical factors are associated with increased uveitis risk: young age (<7 years old) at JIA onset; the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at JIA onset, and JIA category (oligoarticular and polyarticular rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative). [10] [11] [12] Sex is also considered a risk factor, though the available epidemiologic data is controversial. Female patients comprise the majority of JIA categories with uveitis, and are therefore observed somewhat more frequently (but only modestly so) in the overall JIA population. The extent to which biological risk for JIAassociated uveitis is sexually dimorphic, however, is not known. 12 Both JIA and JIA-associated uveitis (i.e., JIA-uveitis) are multifactorial autoimmune disorders; each has a strong, though not fully penetrant, genetic predisposition. 4, 13 Both conditions are complex and driven by biological and environmental factors. 4, 13 There have been no reports of observed Mendelian inheritance patterns of uveitis in JIA-affected families, 4 further indicating a complex trait architecture. Genome-wide association studies in JIA individuals (with and without uveitis) have revealed a number of loci associated to the disease, [14] [15] [16] including multiple independent loci in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which collectively explain >20% of the phenotypic variation in broadly-defined JIA. 16 A number of HLA types have also been identified as increasing risk of JIA-associated uveitis compared to controls. 4, [17] [18] [19] However, genome-wide genetic markers that distinguish JIA without uveitis from JIA-associated uveitis remain elusive, and the exact disease mechanisms predisposing only a subgroup of children to developing uveitis are unknown. Due to the severity of uveitis and the complications surrounding its detection, biomarkers to predict the development of uveitis would help in early detection of the presence of JIAuveitis in high-risk children without frequent, extensive, and costly screenings for all JIA patients."
Synergetic effect of non-complementary 5' AT-rich sequences on the development of a multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR for specific and robust detection of Clavibacter michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis,"Clavibacter is an agriculturally important genus comprising a single species, Clavibacter michiganensis, and multiple subspecies, including, C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis which causes Goss's wilt/blight of corn and accounts for high yield losses -listed among the five most significant diseases of corn in the United States of America. Our research objective was to develop a robust and rapid multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect C. michiganensis in general and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis with enhanced reliability and accuracy by adding non-complementary AT sequences to the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to identify unique and conserved gene regions for primer and probe design. The unique genomic regions, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein CDS/ABC-transporter permease and MFS transporter were determined for specific detection of C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis, respectively. The AT-rich sequences at the 5' position of the primers enhanced the reaction efficiency and sensitivity of rapid qPCR cycling; the reliability, accuracy and high efficiency of the developed assay was confirmed after testing with 59 strains from inclusivity and exclusivity panels -no false positives or false negatives were detected. The assays were also validated through naturally and artificially infected corn plant samples; all samples were detected for C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis with 100% accuracy. The assay with 5' AT-rich sequences detected up to 10-and 100-fg of C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis genome targets, respectively. No adverse effect was observed when sensitivity assays were spiked with host genomic DNA. Addition of 5' AT rich sequences enhanced the qPCR reaction efficiency from 0.82 (M = -3.83) and 0.91 (M = -3.54) to 1.04 (with optimum slope value; M = -3.23) for both C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis, respectively; a increase of 10-fold sensitivity was also obtained with C. michiganensis primer set. The methodology proposed here can be used to optimize the reaction efficiency and to harmonize the diagnostic protocols which have prodigious applications in routine diagnostics, biosecurity and microbial forensics.

Currently, the genus Clavibacter is known only for one species, C. michiganensis which belongs to family Microbacteriaceae within the phytopathogenic coryneform group, known for epi-or endophytic colonization of symptomatic as well as several asymptomatic plant species [1, 2] . Virulence genes within this species are plasmid-borne (not essentially present), while host colonizing genes are chromosomal [3] . Hitherto, nine subspecies based on host specificity and bacteriological characteristics have been identified within the single species of C. michiganensis. C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis is the causal agent of Goss's bacterial wilt and blight of corn (Zea mays), which is listed among the five most significant diseases of corn in the U.S. Goss's wilt accounts for high yield losses in the Great Plains and Midwest regions of the corn belt of the U.S., the largest producer and exporter of corn worldwide. Since the first report in 1969 from Nebraska, the disease has been spreading and adversely impacting corn production in the Midwestern United States including western Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, eastern Nebraska, and eastern Kansas, as well as Canada. Goss's disease shows two major types/phases of symptoms -a leaf blight and a systemic vascular wilt [6, 7, 8] . The leaf blight phase involves leaves and above-ground parts of the plant which exhibit small, dark and discontinuous watersoaked spots; orange shiny bacterial exudates are also observed in advanced stages. The less common wilt phase involves systemic infection of xylem elements resulting in discoloration of vascular bundles, stalk rot and premature plant death. Transmission of Goss's disease usually occurs through open wounds on leaves, and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis can overwinter and remain in plant debris to serve an inoculum for the next crop; transmission through seeds is minimal [2, 8, 9] ."

"SKEMPI 2.0: An updated benchmark of changes in protein-protein binding energy, kinetics and thermodynamics upon mutation","Motivation: Understanding the relationship between the sequence, structure, binding energy, binding kinetics and binding thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions is crucial to understanding cellular signaling, the assembly and regulation of molecular complexes, the mechanisms through which mutations lead to disease, and protein engineering. Results: We present SKEMPI 2.0, a major update to our database of binding free energy changes upon mutation for structurally resolved protein-protein interactions. This version now contains manually curated binding data for 7085 mutations, an increase of 133%, including changes in kinetics for 1844 mutations, enthalpy and entropy changes for 443 mutations, and 440 mutations which abolish detectable binding. Availability:","Protein-protein interactions are central to almost all biological processes, from cellular signal transduction and the assembly of mesoscopic structures such as myofilaments, to viral adhesion and the immune response. Consequently the effects of changes in protein sequence on the structure, thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-protein interactions has wide implications for constraining the permissible substitutions that accrue over the course of evolution, and for understanding the molecular etiology of disease. Methods which measure, predict or optimise these changes have applications in designing de novo interactions [20] , enhancing the specificity and affinity of biological therapeutics (e.g. [3] ), designing combinatorial protein libraries (e.g. [24] ), uncovering the effects of pathological mutations (e.g. [72] ), locating druggable binding sites (e.g. [68] ) and binding hotspots for drug design [25] , altering binding kinetics [13] , [64] , protein-protein docking (e.g. [19] ), and characterising transition states (e.g. [75] ), binding pathways [61] , and sequence-affinity landscapes [2] ."
Accurate prediction of human essential genes using only nucleotide composition and association information,"Three groups recently identified essential genes in human cancer cell lines using wet experiments, and these genes are of high values. Herein, we improved the widely used Z curve method by creating a λ -interval Z curve, which considered interval association information. With this method and recursive feature elimination technology, a computational model was developed to predict human gene essentiality.","Catalogs of essential genes on a whole-genome scale, determined using wet-lab methods, are available for several prokaryotic (Mushegian and Koonin 1996; Luo et al. 2014; Pechter et al. 2016 ) and eukaryotic organisms (Kamath et al. 2003; Amsterdam et al. 2004; Liao and Zhang 2007; Kim et al. 2010) . Computational methods with high accuracy offer an appealing alternative method for identifying essential genes. Computational methods are broadly divided into three types: machine learning-based methods combining intrinsic and context-dependent features (Deng et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2013) , flux balance analysis-based methods (Kuepfer et al. 2005; del Rio et al. 2009; Gatto et al. 2015) , and homology search and evolutionary analysis-based methods (Peng et al. 2012; Wei et al. 2013) . With respect to essential gene prediction in bacteria, we integrated the orthology and phylogenetic information and subsequently developed a universal tool named Geptop , which has shown the highest accuracy among all state-of-the-art algorithms."
Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread -with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform agedependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","The ongoing outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been characterised by a pattern of spread with most cases occur in older individuals, and in particular very few cases have been seen in under-15s [1, 2] . This suggests that transmission is characterised by age-specific heterogeneities going beyond those explained by differences in contact patterns across age groups."
Identification of a Nidovirales Orf1a N7-guanine cap Methyltransferase signature- sequence as a genetic marker of large genome Tobaniviridae Running title: RNA cap N7-guanine Methyltransferase in Tobaniviridae Orf1a,"Members of the Nidovirales order have (+)RNA genomes amongst the largest in size in the RNA virus world. Expression of their genes is promoted through reading of genomic RNA and mRNA transcripts by the ribosome of the infected cell. The 5'-end of these RNAs is supposedly protected by an RNA-cap structure (m7GpppNm) whose most synthesis steps remain elusive. In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2'-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2'-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold. Many Nidovirales members lack either any RNA MTase signature sequence (e.g., Arteriviridae), or lack a N7-guanine MTase signature sequence (e.g., Tobaniviridae, Euroniviridae, Roniviridae, Medioniviridae). Both nsp14-and nsp16-like enzyme genes are usually located in Orf1b encoding for the replication machinery. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossman fold RNA MTase in the Orf1a of ten Tobaniviridae members. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses identify this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase.","regarding their RNA capping pathway, it only succeeded in predicting 2'OMTase, while a second non-canonical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase was later structurally and functionally characterized [4, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Until then, viral MTases matched a specific structural architecture, the Rossmann fold (RF), which possess a unique interaction geometry that represents a fingerprint of common ancestry. The discovery of a non-Rossmann fold (NRF) MTase unveiled the limitation of annotating ""dark proteome"" data [15] , lacking structural counterparts. In Nidovirales, enzyme activities have been experimentally evidenced only for coronaviruses and roniviruses [16] . The putative first step of the Nidovirales RNA capping pathway, involving a 5'-triphosphatase, is uncertain: such activity exists in the Coronavirus helicase (nsp13, [17] ), but its involvement in RNA capping has not been directly demonstrated. The guanylyltransferase also remains unknown: A nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) activity was found to be associated to the N-terminus of the arterivirus nsp9 RdRp [18] , but its role in arterivirus RNA synthesis, if any, remains to be determined."

Article: Discoveries On the causes of evolutionary transition:transversion bias,"A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several-fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the ""conservative transitions"" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.","Of the 12 types of changes from one nucleotide to another, 8 are ""transversions"" between a purine (A or G) and a pyrimidine (C or T) , and the other 4 are ""transitions""."

"Decoupling the effects of nutrition, age and behavioral caste 2 on honey bee physiology and immunity","25 Nutritional stress, and especially a dearth of pollen, is considered an important factor associated 26 with honey bee colony losses. We used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the 27 nutritional stress conditions experienced in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural 28 areas. This model was complemented by the establishment of an experimental design, which 29 allowed us to uncouple the effect of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size and 30 demography. We used this system to determine the effect of pollen restriction on workers' 31 behavioral development. Then, we analyzed the effect of nutritional stress, behavior and age on 32 the expression of key physiological genes involved in the regulation of division of labor. Finally, 33 we analyzed the effects of these variables on the expression of immune genes and the titers of 34 honey bee viruses. Our results show that pollen restriction led to an increased number of 35 precocious foragers and this behavioral transition was associated with important changes in the 36 expression of nutritionally regulated physiological genes, immunity and viral titers. Vitellogenin 37 (vg) and major royal jelly protein 1 (mrjp1) were the most predictive markers of nutrition and 38 behavior. The expression of immune genes was primarily affected by behavior, with higher levels 39 in foragers. Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers were significantly affected by behavior and 40 nutritional status, with higher titer in foragers and increased levels associated with pollen 41 ingestion. Correlation analyses support the predominant effect of behavior on immunity and 42 susceptibility to viral infection, revealing that both immune genes and DWV exhibited strong 43 negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive correlations with genes 44 associated with foraging. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms 45 by which nutritional stress induce precocious foraging and increased susceptibility to viral 46 infections. 48 Approximately 35-40% of the world's crop production comes from plant species that depend on 49 animal pollination [1] which is carried out primarily by honey bees [2]. However, populations of 50 honey bees have experienced a severe decline during recent years worldwide [3, 4]. Possible 51 causes for colony losses have been proposed, including the effects of pesticides [5], nutritional 52 stress [6-8], the parasitic mite Varroa destructor [9, 10] and synergistic interactions between 53 Varroa and honey bee viruses [11]. However, none of these independent factors is consistently 54 associated with colony losses to suggest a single causal agent [3]. Thus, colony losses are likely 55 the result of the combination of several underlying factors [12, 13].","7 147 parasites, such as the microsporidia Nosema ceranae, are associated with high JH and low vg 148 levels and precocious foraging [25] . However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by 149 which colony nutritional conditions lead to changes in behavioral development, susceptibility to 150 pathogens and ultimately, colony survival."
TITLE PAGE The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs by single cell transcriptome study,"The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO. Thousands of human infections have been diagnosed in China along with many other countries, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3.","The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has sparked alarm around the world.

Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection. Methods: We evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results. Plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Conclusion. LCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.","Introduction. Bacterial infection remains the major infectious cause of death in children (1) . Identifying the small number of children with serious bacterial infection (SBI -microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection with systemic symptoms) amongst the majority with viral infections remains difficult, as clinical features are unreliable. Laboratory markers including white cell count, neutrophil proportion and C-reactive protein (CRP) have the strongest predictive value in children with clinically obvious SBI, rather than in the more numerous group with clinically uncertain infection status (2). Blood cultures, considered the gold standard for diagnosing SBI, are unhelpful for early antibiotic decisions as results are not immediately available, and are often negative if pre-admission antibiotics have been administered. In the UK there has been a 30% increase in hospital admission for children with probable infection (3), and the majority of children admitted with fever are discharged without a pathogen diagnosis. Many children with self-limiting viral illnesses are admitted to hospital and receive unnecessary antibiotics whilst awaiting the results of cultures, contributing Table 1 .

The proportion of children with male sex or with Caucasian ethnicity (mode ethnicity) was not significantly different between groups. Severity of illness, as indicated by the number of children requiring PICU admission, inotrope use and ventilation, was highest in the Definite Bacterial group and lowest in the Definite Viral group. Deaths in each group were not significantly different."
A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 2 admitted hospital patients,Background The outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019,"showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial 45 onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 46 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the 47 contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after 48 initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased.

,An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-,"2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China since December 2019. 1, 2 World Health Organization (WHO) now has named the disease COVID-19, short for ""coronavirus disease 2019"". 3 Most cases from the initial cluster had an epidemiological link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 4 Patients have clinical manifestations including fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, and nausea and vomiting. 5, 6 As of 17 February 2020, a cumulative total of 72,436 confirmed cases (including 11,741 currently severe cases), 6,242 currently suspect cases, a cumulative total of 1,868 deaths and 12,552 cases discharged from hospital were reported by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) in mainland China. 7 The significant increases in the number of confirmed cases in China and abroad led to the announcement made by WHO on 30 January that the event has already constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 8 The reproduction number, R, measures the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by each infected person, the initial constant of which is called the basic reproduction number, R0, 9 and the actual average number of secondary cases per infected case at time t is called effective reproduction number, Rt.

SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors,"Next-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to study samples composed of mixtures of organisms, such as in clinical applications where the presence of a pathogen at very low abundance may be highly important. We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species-and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.","There are many different methods that characterize the mixture of organisms present within a metagenomic dataset. Such datasets are generated when a complex environmental sample is processed by a ""next-generation"" high-throughput genome sequencing protocol, and they consist of large numbers of short nucleotide sequences. Each sequence represents a small fragment of a randomly selected genome from the very large collection of genomes present in the source sample. Those sequences indicate the presence of one organism or another according to their similarity to a set of known reference genomes. While a given sequence may be unique to one species, it also may be found in diverse organisms across the tree of life. Therefore, one analytical challenge (among many) is to take that collection of sequences (likely numbering in the millions) and accurately determine what species are present in the sample. Here we describe a novel method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) that is specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of targeted organisms from a metagenomic dataset by aligning reads to genomic regions that are unique at the strain or species level."
TaxIt: An iterative and automated computational pipeline for untargeted strain-level identification using MS/MS spectra from pathogenic samples,"Untargeted accurate strain-level classification of a priori unidentified organisms using tandem mass spectrometry is a challenging task. Reference databases often lack taxonomic depth, limiting peptide assignments to the species level. However, the extension with detailed strain information increases runtime and decreases statistical power. In addition, larger databases contain a higher number of similar proteomes. We present TaxIt, an iterative workflow to address the increasing search space required for MS/MS-based strain-level classification of samples with unknown taxonomic origin. TaxIt first applies reference sequence data for initial identification of species candidates, followed by automated acquisition of relevant strain sequences for low level classification. Furthermore, proteome similarities resulting in ambiguous taxonomic assignments are addressed with an abundance weighting strategy to improve candidate confidence. We apply our iterative workflow on several samples of bacterial and viral origin. In comparison to noniterative approaches using unique peptides or advanced abundance correction, TaxIt identifies microbial strains correctly in all examples presented (with one tie), thereby demonstrating the potential for untargeted and deeper taxonomic classification. TaxIt makes extensive use of public, unrestricted and continuously growing sequence resources such as the NCBI databases and is available under open-source license at https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics.","Pathogenic strain identification using LC-MS/MS-based proteomics presents a crucial, yet highly challenging task. Many pathogenic strains feature significant phenotypic differences within a species with respect to pathogenicity, zoonotic potential, cell attachment and entry, host-virus interaction and clinical symptoms [1] [2] [3] . In a diagnostic context, strain-level knowledge is important to infer virulence 4, 5 and drug resistance 6 for appropriate therapy. However, inferring exact strain information from proteomic samples remains a difficult task, in particular when the taxonomic origin of a sample is unknown and when related strains feature high sequence similarity. In recent years, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has gained popularity as fast, sensitive and economical method for microbial biotyping. However, identifying strains using MALDI-TOF workflows is still very challenging and requires curated, often proprietary spectral databases 7 . Several commercial platforms for microbial biotyping down to the species or strain level are available based on MALDI and other technologies such as the Bruker MALDI Biotyper Systems 8 , the Bruker Strain typing with IR Biotyper 9 and the Ibis T5000 Universal Biosensor 10 . Several studies report on limitations of MALDI-TOF biotyping for strain-level identifications and advocate advancements towards MS/MS marker peptide detection and, consequently, the analysis was shifted to the MS/MS level 11, 12 . In these studies, however, the MS/MS-based protein identification was established using sequence databases that were already targeted or restricted to particular species or limited sets. In contrast, untargeted MS/MS typing approaches are limited to species level identification 6, 13 . However, in general MS/MS is preferred for the analysis of complex unpurified peptide mixtures as it is considered to provide more distinct and unambiguous peptide and protein identifications 14 and thus increased proteome resolution 15 as well as higher statistical confidence 16 . In particular, organisms with unknown taxonomic origin benefit from peptide sequence-based analysis, as MALDI-based biotyping is in comparison too prone to ambiguous identifications 17 . Furthermore, advances in instrumentation including higher resolution, mass accuracy and dynamic range increasingly allow for identification of the majority of all fragmented peptides 18 resulting in higher sensitivity, higher coverage of target proteomes and thus higher availability of distinctive features. Taking advantage of the vast amount of available protein sequences for MS/MS strain-level identification is challenging. On the one hand, constraining the search space may result in unidentified strains or incorrectly assigned taxa, in particular for non-model organisms 19 . On the other hand, applying large databases is not recommended either since it decreases peptide identification rates 20 and thus eventually impedes taxonomic inference 21 . Furthermore, with increasing database size sequence quality often decreases (e.g. when using the complete NCBI Protein in comparison to the NCBI RefSeq database) and contaminant sequences may occur more often 22 . Therefore, extended databases should only be used when necessary. However, strain-level identification of MS/MS spectra from samples with unclear taxonomic status requires an untargeted search against comprehensive databases holding as many strains as possible. A common and popular concept to handle increased search spaces is the application of multiple identification steps in general, independently of target application such as strain-level identification. These multi-stage identification search strategies are described by several different terms such as serial search 23 , multi-step 24 , iterative 25, 26 , multi-stage 27 , two-step [28] [29] [30] as well as cascade search 31 and they find application in proteomics, metaproteomics 26, 28 and proteogenomics 30, 32 . Most of these strategies do not only overlap in their objective of increasing the identification rate or identification confidence, but share methodological principles as well. This includes the concept of identifying primarily unassigned spectra using databases of increasing complexity (for instance, by employing altered digestion parameters, additional post-translational modifications or additional spectral and genomic databases) [24] [25] [26] [27] 31 as well as the recurring theme of database size reduction 24, 26, [28] [29] [30] 32 . In addition, some methods rely on spectral quality assessment to enhance subsequent identification steps 25, 32 or exhibit a focus on algorithmic runtime reduction 24 . Apart from database size, multi-proteome databases present an additional challenge for taxonomic assignment in the form of high sequence similarity between proteomes, in particular between related species and strains. These similarities give rise to taxonomically ambiguous, widespread and false assignments and thus need to be accounted for. Several methods exist that provide various strategies to account for ambiguous peptide spectrum matches due to sequence similarity. Dworzanski et al. apply a proteogenomic mapping approach in combination with discriminant analysis to infer most likely bacterial assignments 33 . The proteogenomic approach was further developed in BACid that applies several statistical measures to account for similarity, including the comparison of ratios of taxonomic differences and of unique peptides to known error rates, i.e. the noise levels 34, 35 . BACid has since been applied to and extended for samples of unknown origin 36 as well as mixtures of bacteria 36, 37 . With the focus on metaproteomic analysis, MEGAN 38 , UniPept 39 , MetaProteomeAnalyzer 40,41 and TCUP 6 rely on lowest common ancestor or most specific taxonomy approaches to assign peptides spectrum matches to taxonomic levels. MiCId uses a clustering approach based on peptidome similarity of taxa on different levels in combination with unified E-values to infer statistically significant representatives of clusters as identified or classified microorganisms 13, 42 . Tracz et al. use a direct assignment strategy by concatenating all proteins of a proteome into one pseudo-polyprotein and considering only the top-scored spectrum matches to a peptide as counts for bacterial candidates 43 . In contrast, Pipasic explicitly makes use of ambiguous peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) by applying abundance correction based on intensityweighted proteome similarities of organisms in metaproteomic samples 44 . While these methods share the objective of reducing uncertainty in taxonomic identification due to ambiguous assignments in the context of the protein inference issue 45 , their application for untargeted strain-level identification is not straightforward for several reasons. For example, unique peptides are not necessarily available for all candidate strains in the sequence databases for which the information given is often limited to species or higher taxonomic levels. In addition, the approaches rely on fully sequenced genomes (and thus uniform proteome coverage) or other forms of targeted, curated, inhouse or validated databases and are thus restricted to a predefined limited set of organisms, often with definite focus on bacteria. Furthermore, some methods do not scale well with immoderate large databases (i.e. high number of proteomes) with respect to computational or analytical performance. Previous multi-step procedures illustrate the effect of database size on identification confidence and the advantage of applying concise, prefiltered or specialized databases. Thus, we transfer the general concept of multi-step procedures to approach the increased search space necessary for untargeted and detailed taxonomic classification. We present TaxIt, an iterative workflow for untargeted strain-level identification of protein samples. By applying two separate identification steps for species-and strain-level classification, we circumvent the immediate need for a comprehensive database containing strain All rights reserved.

The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s).","Given the expanding pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, it is of great importance to consider and plan intervention strategies to slow down SARS-CoV-2 spread, with the aim to flatten the epidemic peak, and thus decrease surge capacity problems arising to health care provision and essential supplies. This may also allow to buy time for interventions, such as specific antivirals (and perhaps vaccines) to become available for widespread use [1] .

"Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence 1","Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses without experiencing disease. A mechanistic understanding of 25 the impact of bats' virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, 26 on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus 27 infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then 28 developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit 29 models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting 30 robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral 31 propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular 32 morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections 33 within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely 34 cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that 35 diverge from those unique to bats. 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 .

Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will 63 induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-and IFN-), which promote expression and 64 translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells and render them effectively 65 antiviral (Stetson and Medzhitov 2006). In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this 66 IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or 67 DNA (Zhou et al. 2016). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit 68 widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats 69","We defined ""induced immunity"" as complete, modeling all cells as susceptible to viral 185 invasion at disease free equilibrium, with defenses induced subsequent to viral exposure through 186 the term . By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the 187 parameter range of > 0, defining a ""constitutive"" system as one containing any antiviral cells at 188 disease free equilibrium.

Pathogens can invade a host tissue culture when 0 > 1. Rapid rates of constitutive antiviral 208 acquisition ( ) will drive 0 < 1: tissue cultures with highly constitutive antiviral immunity will 209 be therefore resistant to virus invasion from the outset. Since, by definition, induced immunity is 210 stimulated following initial virus invasion, the rate of induced antiviral acquisition ( ) is not 211 incorporated into the equation for 0 ; while induced immune processes can control virus after 212 initial invasion, they cannot prevent it from occurring to begin with. In cases of fully induced or 213 absent immunity ( = 0), the 0 equation thus reduces to a form typical of the classic SEIR 214 model: 215 12 know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play). Because constitutive 251 immune assumptions can prohibit pathogen invasion ( 0 < 1), model fits to this time series 252 under constitutive assumptions were handicapped by overestimations of , which prohibited 253 pathogen invasion.

Novel ionophores active against La Crosse virus identified through rapid 1 antiviral screening 2 3,"Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic 26 fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California 27 serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often 28 asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals 29 have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential 30 antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral 31 molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that 32 exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, 33 was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in 34 multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or 35 infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a 36 known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that 37 the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift 38 Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), 39 and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant 40 reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of 41 potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus 42 replication. 43 44 Importance 45 No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection.

Valinomycin, a top hit in our screen, functions by transporting 101 potassium ions against the electrochemical gradient. We investigated the antiviral activity of 102 valinomycin, observing that valinomycin exhibits antiviral activity in several cellular systems, in a 103 dose-dependent manner and independent of treatment time. We also found that valinomycin does 104 not directly inactivate viral particles, highlighting a cellular role for potassium ions in virus infection. 105"
How does the outbreak of 2019-nCoV spread in mainland China? A retrospective analysis of the dynamic transmission routes *,"The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a timevarying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 -February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential interprovince routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.","Coronaviruses are single-stranded, enveloped and positive-sense RNA viruses, which are spherical in shape and have petal-like spines [1] . Firstly discovered and identified in 1965 [2] , coronaviruses have not caused large-scale outbreaks until the 2003 SARS epidemic in China, followed by 2012 MERS in Saudi Arabia and 2015 MERS in South Korea [3] . Although the exact origin remains debatable [4] , the fourth outbreak has taken place in Hubei province of China in December 2019 and rapidly spread out nationally [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . On January 10, 2020, the WHO officially named this new coronavirus as the 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, and released a comprehensive interim guidance on dealing with this new virus for all countries [11] . As of February 19, there are 75,101 confirmed cases (including 2,121 death report) in China, among which over 80% are from Hubei and over 50% are from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei [12] ."
HIV-1 Protease Evolvability is Affected by Synonymous Nucleotide Recoding 1 2,"One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how codon choice influences 27 population diversity and evolvability.

On the other hand, both WT 140 and MAX viruses propagated in the presence of PIs developed previously described 141 resistance mutations to ATV and DRV (Table 3) . Moreover, the resistance variant 142 repertoire differed between the MAX and WT viruses (Table 3) . Specifically, the G16E (Table 2) , was also included in this analysis. We found that the five generated mutants 165 displayed comparable IC 50 values to ATV in both backgrounds, WT and MAX (Table   166 3).

Researchers reported that about 12% COVID-19 patients suffered acute cardiac injury [2] . Patients with cardiac disease have a higher fatality rate. However, the alerting clinical parameters of cardiac injury after COVID-19 infection and the correlation between cardiac injury and the COVID-19 severity remains to be determined. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 41 consecutive cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to Beijing Youan Hospital, China from Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020. We selected the indicators, including heart rate (HR), Troponin I (TnI) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) observed on chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, that is high related to cardiac injury. Tachycardia, TnI elevation and a trend of lower threshold attenuation EAT density in CT scan have been observed in severe and critical patients. Our results suggested that main attentions should be paid on monitoring the high risk factors of arrhythmia and cardiac function, including HR, TnI, and radiographic feature, that is, EAT density, to protect the COVID-19 patients from cardiac injury."

An anti-cancer binary system activated by bacteriophage HK022 Integrase,"Cancer gene therapy is a great promising tool for cancer therapeutics due to the specific targeting based on the cancerous gene expression background. Binary systems based on sitespecific recombination are one of the most effective potential approaches for cancer gene therapy. In these systems, a cancer specific promoter expresses a site-specific recombinase/integrase that in turn controls the expression of a toxin gene. In the current study, we have developed a new HK022 bacteriophage Integrase (Int) based binary system activating a Diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene expression specifically in cancer cells. We have demonstrated the efficiency, and the high specificity of the system in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in a lung cancer mouse model. Strikingly, different apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors demonstrated a remarkable efficacy killing capability of the Int-based binary system compared to the conventional hTERT-DTA mono system in the LLC-Kat lung cancer mice model; we observed that the active hTERT promoter down regulation by the transcription factors Mad-1 is the cornerstone of this phenomenon.

The Influence Of Social Behavior On Competition Between Virulent Pathogen Strains 2,"Infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease 7 control and elimination. The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen 8 is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively 9 to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing 10 natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the 11 influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple 12 a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain 13 with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective 14 behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of 15 the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane 16 analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against 17 them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour 18 enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain 19 has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing 20 the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our 21 results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour 22 in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts 23 to control infectious diseases. 24 1 .

IFIT3 and IFIT2/3 promote IFIT1-mediated translation inhibition by enhancing binding to non-self RNA,word count: 197,"The host innate immune response provides a first line defence against invading pathogens. Following infection, pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) sense non-self, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) triggering signalling pathways that activate an immune response (reviewed in 1). Detection of viral signatures by PRRs, such as RIG I-like receptor sensing of double stranded RNA, induces production of Type I and Type III interferon (IFN). Through binding of cell surface IFN receptors and subsequent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, IFN activates the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (2), many with known antiviral properties, priming neighbouring cells to restrict viral spread."

Structure of dimeric full-length human ACE2 in complex with B 0 AT1,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (S protein). ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. B 0 AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B 0 AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B 0 AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homodimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B 0 AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.","The 2019-nCoV is a type of positive-stranded RNA viruses that causes severe respiratory syndrome in human. The resulting outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a severe epidemic, claiming more than one hundred lives everyday (1, 2) .

Changes in temperature alter susceptibility to a virus following a Short title: Influence of temperature on virus host shifts 4 5,Host shifts -where a pathogen jumps between different host species -are an 18 important source of emerging infectious disease. With ongoing climate change 19 there is an increasing need to understand the effect changes in temperature may 20 have on emerging infectious disease. We investigated whether species' 21 susceptibilities change with temperature and ask if susceptibility is greatest at 22 different temperatures in different species. We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae 23 with an RNA virus and measured how viral load changes with temperature. We 24 . CC-BY 4.0,"2 found the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in viral load 25 at each temperature, with strong phylogenetic correlations between viral loads 26 across temperature. The variance in viral load increased with temperature, whilst 27 the mean viral load did not, such that as temperature increased the most 28 susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We 29 found no significant relationship between a species' susceptibility across 30 temperatures and proxies for thermal optima; critical thermal maximum and 31 minimum or basal metabolic rate. These results suggest that whilst the rank order 32 of species susceptibilities can remain the same with changes in temperature, the 33 likelihood of host shifts into a given species may increase or decrease.

Inferring generation-interval distributions from contact-tracing 2 data,"Generation intervals, defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when 14 that individual infects another person, link two key quantities that describe an epidemic: 15 the reproductive number, R, and the rate of exponential growth, r. Generation intervals 16 are often measured through contact tracing by identifying who infected whom. We study 17 how observed intervals differ from ""intrinsic"" intervals that could be estimated by tracing 18 individual-level infectiousness, and identify both spatial and temporal effects, including cen-19 soring (due to observation time), and the effects of susceptible depletion at various spatial 20 scales. Early in an epidemic, we expect the variation in the observed generation intervals to 21 be mainly driven by the censoring and the population structure near the source of disease 22 spread; therefore, we predict that correcting observed intervals for the effect of temporal 23 censoring but not for spatial effects will provide a spatially informed ""effective"" generation-24 interval distribution, which will correctly link r and R.

Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV,"The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.","The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 [1] . As of January 26 (17:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 2033 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 56 deaths [2] . The 2019-nCoV cases were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all these cases were exported from Wuhan, see WHO news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14-21. The outbreak is still on-going. A recently published preprint by Imai et al. estimated that a total of 1723 (95%CI: 427-4471) cases of 2019-nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [3] . The likelihood of travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by [4] , which indicates the potentials of regional and global spread [5] ."
MERS-CoV recombination: implications about the reservoir and potential for adaptation,"Recombination is a process that unlinks neighbouring loci allowing for independent evolutionary trajectories within genomes of many organisms. If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.","Recombination is an important process which expedites selection in many organisms (Muller, 1932) by unlinking loci. It also leads to different parts of recombining genomes to have different histories which, if not properly accounted for, can interfere with many genetic analyses, of which phylogenetic methods are amongst the most sensitive. Not accounting for recombination in phylogenetic analyses leads to incorrect (Schierup and Hein, 2000) and poorly supported genealogies (Posada and Crandall, 2002) and false inference of selection (Anisimova et al., 2003; Shriner et al., 2003) ."
"A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR A SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM BASED ON ROUTINE AMBULANCE RECORDS IN THE SOUTH-WEST OF ENGLAND, FOR THE INFLUENZA SEASON A PREPRINT","The introduction of electronic patient records in the ambulance service provides new opportunities to monitor the population. Most patients presenting to British ambulance services are discharged at scene. Ambulance records are therefore an ideal data source for syndromic early event detection systems to monitor infectious disease in the prehospital population. It has been previously found that tympanic temperature records can be used to detect influenza outbreaks in emergency departments. This study investigated whether routine tympanic temperature readings collected by ambulance crews can be used to detect seasonal influenza. Here we show that these temperature readings do allow the detection of seasonal influenza before methods applied to conventional data sources. The counts of pyretic patients were used to calculate a sliding case ratio (CR) as a measurement to detect seasonal influenza outbreaks. This method does not rely on conventional thresholds and can be adapted to the data. The data collected correlated with seasonal influenza. The 2016/17 outbreak was detected with high specificity and sensitivity, up to 9 weeks before other surveillance programs. An unanticipated outbreak of E. coli was detected in the same dataset. Our results show that ambulance records can be a useful data source for biosurveillance systems. Two outbreaks caused by different infectious agents have been successfully detected. The routine ambulance records allowed to use tympanic temperature readings that can be used as surveillance tool for febrile diseases. Therefore, this method is a valuable addition to the current surveillance tools.","Most infections result in pyrexia [2, 3] , therefore body temperature-based surveillance systems are unspecific but sensitive to virtually any pyrexia causing disease."
A deterministic epidemic model for the emergence of COVID-19 in China,"Coronavirus disease broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and soon after Chinese health authorities took unprecedented prevention and control measures to curb the spreading of the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia. We develop a mathematical model based on daily updates of reported cases to study the evolution of the epidemic. With the model, on 95% confidence level, we estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 = 2.82 ± 0.11, time between March 19 and March 21 when the effective reproduction number becoming less than one, the epidemic ending after April 2 and the total number of confirmed cases approaching 14408 ± 429 on the Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province.","exponential before the time and softened afterwards. A similarity is also observed on the curve of cumulative removed cases (recoveries plus deaths), with delay of a few days. The change indicates the control measures have taken in effect. How to evaluate the effect quantitatively, and in particular, to predict the evolution of the disease would be highly desired.

"Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts","Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control.","Since emerging in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 1 , the epidemic of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has progressed rapidly. The disease caused by this virus, dubbed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by the World Health Organization (WHO) is characterized by fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, pneumonia, and other respiratory tract symptoms [2] [3] [4] , and in many cases progresses to death. As of February 24, 2020, there have been 79,331 confirmed cases and 2,618 deaths reported worldwide 5 . The vast majority of these remain confined to Hubei province, but there has been significant spread elsewhere in China and the world.

The Infectious Bronchitis Virus Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH to Protect Spike Protein and Promote Release of Infectious Virus,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential.,"The majority of human coronaviruses (CoVs) cause mild disease phenotypes. However, when novel coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV emerge from their animal reservoirs to infect humans they elicit a robust and aberrant immune response that can lead to a very serious and deadly pneumonia (1) (2) (3) . Importantly, there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics to treat these CoVs. Efforts to develop long-term therapeutic strategies to combat novel, highly pathogenic CoVs will be aided by increased understanding of conserved viral mechanisms at the level of their cell and molecular biology."

Restriction Factor in Yeasts 2 3,"In eukaryotes, the degradation of cellular mRNAs is accomplished by Xrn1p and 24 the cytoplasmic exosome. Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, 25 they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack 26 sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA 27 degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. One model is that the RNA of yeast 28 viruses is subject to degradation simply as a side effect of the intrinsic exonuclease 29 activity of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Contrary to this model, we find a highly 30 refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the ""L-A"" totiviruses of different 31 Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under 32 positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p 33 protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that 34 these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where 35 Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically 36 infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-37 A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii. All Xrn1p orthologs are 38 equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon.","To differentiate between models where Xrn1p restricts L-A through a passive 158 mechanism that is incidental to its inherant exonuclease activity, or through an active 159 mechanism where Xrn1p evolves to optimally suppress L-A replication, we first looked 160 for evidence of positive selection (dN/dS > 1) within the genes encoding the major 161 components of the SKI complex, the exosome, and Xrn1p ( Fig 1B) . Importantly, cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. arboricolus, and S. bayanus) 171 [44] [45] [46] and created a multiple sequence alignment. We then analyzed each alignment 172 for evidence of codons with dN/dS > 1 using four commonly employed tests for positive 173 selection [47, 48] . We see some evidence for positive selection of specific codon sites in 174 several of these genes, however, only XRN1 and the exosome subunit gene RRP40 175 passed all four tests ( Fig 1C; Table S1 ). Other genes are determined to be under surprising for a critical and conserved gene involved in RNA quality control, but 203 consistent with the signatures of positive selection which suggest that certain parts of 204 this protein are highly divergent between species.

Attenuation of influenza A virus disease severity by viral co-infection in a mouse model 2 3 Short Title: Pathogenesis of influenza viral co-infection 4 5,"word count: 247 12 Text word count: 5,657 Abstract 15 Influenza viruses and rhinoviruses are responsible for a large number of acute respiratory 16 viral infections in human populations and are detected as co-pathogens within hosts. Clinical and 17 epidemiological studies suggest that co-infection by rhinovirus and influenza virus may reduce 18","2 remained focal, in comparison to diffuse inflammation and damage in the lungs of mice infected 27 by PR8. These findings suggest that RV1B stimulates an early immune response that clears PR8 28 while limiting excessive pulmonary inflammation. The timing of RV1B co-infection was a 29 critical determinant of protection, suggesting that sufficient time is needed to induce this 30 response. Finally, disease attenuation was not unique to RV1B: co-infection by a murine 31 coronavirus two days before PR8 also reduced disease severity. This model will be critical for Co-infection by RV leads to more rapid clearance of PR8 from the lungs 146 The above experiments established that RV effectively attenuated disease due to a mild 147 PR8 infection. We next asked whether the reduced virulence during co-infection was due to 148 inhibition of PR8 replication within the lungs. Groups of mice were either mock-inoculated or 149 inoculated with RV two days before inoculating with a low dose of PR8 (Mock/PR8, RV/PR8). 150 Groups of mice were euthanized on days 4, 7, and 10 after PR8 inoculation and lungs were 151 harvested for PR8 quantification. On day 4 after PR8 inoculation, the viral loads in single virus 152 and co-infected mice were not significantly different, but co-infected mice had greater variation 153 within the group (Fig. 2) . However, on day 7, the Mock/PR8-infected mice still had PR8 titers in 154 the 10 4 -10 5 range, whereas the RV/PR8-co-infected mice had undetectable levels of PR8. By day 155 10, both groups had undetectable levels of infectious PR8. This suggests that co-infection with 156 RV did not prevent infection or inhibit early replication of PR8, but induced more rapid 157 clearance of PR8 from the lungs. 158 We also evaluated lung sections for PR8 antigens by immunohistochemistry. The lack of 159 PR8 antigen staining in lung sections from mock-inoculated mice confirmed the specificity of 178 Next, we used a murine lung epithelial cell line (LA-4) that is susceptible to infection by 179 both viruses (30) to determine if co-infection by RV would interfere with PR8 replication in vitro. 180 LA-4 cells were inoculated with RV 6 or 12 hours before or simultaneously with PR8. PR8 181 released into the media was quantified by TCID 50 assay in MDCK cells. We confirmed that the 182 presence of RV in these samples did not interfere with quantification of PR8 in MDCK cells (not 183 shown). There were no significant differences at any time point between cells inoculated with 9 hours before PR8 (Fig. 4B) . The lower PR8 titers at 96 hours may have been due to higher cell 187 death from two viruses being present, providing fewer susceptible cells for PR8 replication."
Intrinsic checkpoint deficiency during cell cycle re-entry from quiescence Condensed title: Underlicensing at cell cycle re-entry,The authors find that human cells re-entering the cell cycle from quiescence have both an impaired p53-dependent DNA replication origin licensing checkpoint and slow origin licensing. This combination makes every first S phase underlicensed and hypersensitive to replication stress.,". Artificially reducing MCM loading in checkpoint-proficient cells delays the late G1 activation of Cyclin E/Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) McIntosh and Blow, 2012) . Delayed Cyclin E/CDK2 activation delays the phosphorylation of multiple substrates that drive S phase entry (Giacinti and Giordano, 2006) . Delaying CDK2 activity lengthens G1 phase and ensures that cells do not enter S phase with low levels of origin licensing. Moreover, this checkpoint is p53-dependent Liu et al., 2009; Shreeram et al., 2002) , thus a common genetic perturbation in transformed cancer cells likely compromises the normal coordination of origin licensing and S phase onset."
Connectivity analyses of bioenergetic changes in schizophrenia: Identification of novel treatments Running title: Bioenergetic function in schizophrenia,"We utilized a cell-level approach to examine glycolytic pathways in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia (n=16) and control (n=16) subjects and found decreased mRNA expression of glycolytic enzymes in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes. To replicate these novel bioenergetic findings, we probed independent datasets for bioenergetic targets and found similar abnormalities. Next, we used a novel strategy to build a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile by a tailored application of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures data portal (iLINCS) and investigated connected cellular pathways, kinases, and transcription factors using Enrichr. Finally, with the goal of identifying drugs capable of ""reversing"" the bioenergetic schizophrenia signature, we performed a connectivity analysis with iLINCS and identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising therapeutic targets. We administered a PPAR agonist to the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia and found it improved long-term memory. Taken together, our findings suggest that tailored bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of chemical and genetic perturbagens may be employed to identify novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and related diseases.","Schizophrenia is a devastating illness that affects over 2 million people in the U.S. and displays a wide range of symptoms (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) .

Curiously, the Tbps are only found in host specific pathogens, and are 15 themselves host specific, meaning that they will bind to the transferrin of their host species, but 16 not to those of other animal species. While this phenomenon has long been established, neither 17 the steps in the evolutionary process that led to this exquisite adaptation for the host, nor the 18 steps that could alter it, are known. We sought to gain insight into these processes by studying 19","Virulence factor specificity arises over the course of evolutionary arms races between pathogens 49 and their hosts (1-4). In this conflict, mutations that help the host evade the pathogen confer a 50 fitness advantage, and in turn, compensatory mutations that allow the pathogen to continue 51 exploiting the host confer an advantage to the pathogen. After multiple rounds of coevolution, 52 the pathogen becomes uniquely adapted to the host and may lose affinity for proteins found in 53 other host species, resulting in specificity (5).

Critical Nodes of Virus-Host Interaction Revealed Through an Integrated Network Analysis,"Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape. author/funder.

"2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients: Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China","The outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan has become a global epidemic of contagious diseases, which poses a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlined diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients (16.09%) and 4 cases among 33 (12.12%)staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients : medRxiv preprint progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm.

These patients are at higher risk of admission to intensive care or death [6, 7] . In addition, the profound impact inflicted by COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns has also been noticed [8, 9] . However, as far as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease patients, especially uremic HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the large population size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD treatment in 61 centers in Wuhan city.), the high aggregation and mobility of HD center population, and the low immune function of uremic patients [10] , the situation of HD patients under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB impairs keratinocyte fitness by abrogating growth factor signalling,"Lectins are glycan-binding proteins with no catalytic activity and ubiquitously expressed in nature. Numerous bacteria employ lectins to efficiently bind to epithelia, thus facilitating tissue colonisation. Wounded skin is one of the preferred niches for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has developed diverse strategies to impair tissue repair processes and promote infection.","Bacteria can employ many different strategies to infect host cells. In all cases the initiation of an infection requires the recognition of specific structures on the host cell plasma membrane. This is often achieved by lectins, which bind to glycosylated residues on proteins or lipids present on the cell surface, mediating the attachment of the bacterium to the cell."
Mating strategy is determinant of Adenovirus prevalence in European bats 2,"Adenoviruses are double-strained DNA viruses found in a great number of vertebrates, 8 including humans. In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a 9 human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are 10 important reservoirs for Adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting Adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across 13 species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of Adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of Adenoviruses 15 across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could 16 hinder transmission of Adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system.

Specific bat characteristics like their ability to fly, unique among mammals, or their 60 migratory capacity [7] , increase their potential role as vectors of diseases. Bats are natural 61 reservoirs for many viruses, such as Coronavirus, Nipah virus and Ebola related to new emerging 62 diseases that have received attention in the last years due to the potential risk they pose for 63 human pandemic events [8] [9] [10] or with important health and economic consequences world-64 wide, such as rabies outbreaks [11, 12] . The capacity to coexist with viruses (in the absence of 65 disease) is probably linked to the bats' immune-system which seems be different to that of other focusing not only on the analysis of fecal samples and internal tissues -as in previous studies-89 but also on the analysis of the oropharyngeal swabs. AdVs are detected in almost half of the 90 Iberian bat species studied, in both feces and in the upper respiratory tract (for the first time in 91 bats), establishing a possible fecal-oral transmission route in two Pipistrellus pygmaeus. 92 Moreover, they found a surprisingly high prevalence in this species together with the co-generic 93 P. kuhlii and the closely related giant noctule, Nyctalus lasiopterus, which accounted for the vast 94 majority of viruses detected in the study.

Potential T-cell and B-cell Epitopes of 2019-nCoV,"As of Feb 16th 2020, 2019-nCoV has infected more than 51,857 people across 26 countries and claimed 1666 lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-nCoV or any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.","Coronaviruses (CoV) first became widely known after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002.

Hand-hygiene mitigation strategies against global disease spreading through the air transportation network,"Hand hygiene is considered as an efficient and cost-effective way to limit the spread of diseases and, as such, it is recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infectious diseases, and has important implications for the way public-health policymakers may design new effective strategies to enhance hand hygiene in airports through behavioral changes.","In past centuries, contagious diseases would migrate slowly and rarely across continents. Black death, for example, which was the second recorded pandemic in history after the Justinian Plague, originated in China in 1334 1 and it took almost 15 years to propagate from East Asia to Western Europe. While contagious diseases were then affecting more individuals within countries due to poor hygiene and underdeveloped medicine, the means of transportation of that era -sea and land -hindered the range and celerity of disease spreading. Nowadays in contrast, transportation means allow people to travel more often (either for business or for leisure) and to longer distances. In particular, the aviation industry has experienced a fast and continuing growth, permitting an expanding flow of air travelers. In 2017 alone, around 4.1 billion people traveled through airports worldwide 2 while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects that the number of passengers will roughly double to 7.8 billion by 2036 3 . Transportation hubs such as airports are therefore playing a key role in the spread of transmittable diseases 4 . In severe cases, such disease-spreading episodes can cause global pandemics and international health and socio-economic crises. Recent examples of outbreaks show how quickly contagious diseases spread around the world through the air transportation network. Examples include the epidemic of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the widespread H1N1 influenza. SARS initial outbreak occurred in February 2003, when a guest at a hotel in Hong Kong transmitted an infection to 16 other guests in a single day. The infected guests then transmitted the disease in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam during the next few days, and within weeks the disease became an epidemic affecting over 8,000 people in 26 countries across 5 airport to a destination airport, and indicates any intermediate connecting flights (see Table 1 International Airport, Beijing, China) to HND (Haneda Airport, Tokyo, Japan), X2 individuals traveled from PEK to HND with a layover at PVG (Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Shanghai, China), and X3 individuals traveled from ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, USA) to ABV (Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Nigeria) with connecting flights at JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, USA) and CDG (Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, France) airports."
Association of Population migration and Coronavirus Disease 2019 epidemic control,"To analyze the impact of different patterns of migration flow in two cities, Hefei and Shenzhen, on the epidemic and disease control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 , in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies.","In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology was reportedly linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.[1-4] Soon after, it was confirmed that this pneumonia was caused by infection of a novel pathogen [5] , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as recently named by the World Health Organization, and the disease caused by such virus infection, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [6] . In January 2020, a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 occurred following the beginning of the largest annual migration in China known as the Spring Festival migration. Due to the geographic location of Wuhan and its role as a central transportation hub, number of cases of infection rose rapidly [7] . By February 11, 2020, over 60,000 cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were reported. [8] . Since January 20, 2020, when it was publicly announced that COVID-19 was human-to-human transmittable [9] [10] , the Chinese government took a series of unprecedented, austere measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. Public transportation was suspended in and out of the city of Wuhan, where the disease initially outbroke, and this was later extended to adjacent areas. [11] Other provinces followed suit and successively took precautionary actions in accordance with the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, including passenger body temperature surveillance at railway stations and airports, and restriction of large gatherings.

Title: Analyzing Vaccine Trials in Epidemics with Mild and Asymptomatic Infection,"word count: 200 Text word count: 2304 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a ABSTRACT Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES), regardless of symptoms, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for pathogens with a high proportion of asymptomatic","In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a list of priority pathogens with potential to cause future public health emergencies of international concern (1). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has dedicated one billion dollars to vaccine development efforts starting with three of these: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Lassa virus and Nipah virus (2) . These three pathogens, as well as others on the WHO's list, such as Zika virus, have high proportions of asymptomatic or mild infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES) (8) , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, as infection may contribute to onward transmission, and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome, even without primary symptoms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, VES is resource-intensive to estimate as it requires testing all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial, or by serologic testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccine-derived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing trial participants is also necessary for estimating a vaccine's efficacy against progression (VEP) to symptoms, another critical outcome measurement (8) . As noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may in general differ from protection against infection (and in the case of dengue, VEP may be negative due to antibody dependent enhancement) (15) . It is therefore important to consider estimates of both VES and VEP when analyzing trial results."
Neuronal CCL2 expression drives inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain during acute virus infection,"Background: Viral encephalitis is a dangerous compromise between the need to robustly clear pathogen from the brain and the need to protect neurons from bystander injury. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of C57Bl/6 mice is a model of viral encephalitis in which the compromise results in hippocampal damage and permanent neurological sequelae. We previously identified brain infiltrating inflammatory monocytes as the primary driver of this hippocampal pathology, but the mechanisms involved in recruiting these cells to the brain were unclear. Methods: Chemokine expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by microarray, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection was measured by flow cytometry. CCL2 levels were manipulated by immunodepletion and by specific removal from neurons in mice generated by crossing a line expressing the Cre recombinase behind the synapsin promoter to animals with floxed CCL2. Results: Inoculation of the brain with TMEV induced hippocampal production of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 that peaked at 6 hours postinfection, whereas inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV did not elicit this response. Immunofluorescence revealed that hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of CCL2 at this timepoint. Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 abrogated or blunted the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during acute infection. Specific genetic deletion of CCL2 from neurons reduced serum and hippocampal CCL2 levels and inhibited inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain. Conclusions: We conclude that intracranial inoculation with infectious TMEV rapidly induces the expression of CCL2 in neurons, and this cellular source is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis. These findings highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system.","Neural injury associated with virus infection represents a multifaceted convergence of hostpathogen interactions that range from direct lytic killing of infected neurons to bystander pathology mediated by brain-infiltrating immune cells responding to chemotactic and inflammatory cues. Viral encephalitis is a trade-off between the need to clear pathogen from the brain and the need to preserve irreplaceable neurons and neural circuits: too little inflammation and the host dies of uncontrolled infection, too much inflammation and the host suffers permanent brain damage [1] . And while much attention is rightly given to viral encephalitides associated with human mortality, there is likely a significant component of neural injury associated with low-level, sub-clinical viral infections of the central nervous system that are ultimately cleared by the host. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a model of such an infection [2] . When C57Bl/6 mice are inoculated via intracranial delivery of the Daniel's strain of TMEV there is an acute viral encephalitis that culminates in generation of an antiviral T cell-mediated response, development of virus neutralizing antibodies, clearance of the virus, and resolution of brain inflammation over the course of about 45 days [3] . However, despite essentially complete resolution of the infection, permanent neurological sequelae such as impaired spatial learning [2, 4] , anxiety [5] , and epilepsy [6] occur in most post-infectious animals. Uniquely, these neurologic problems largely stem from bystander loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons and subsequent disruption of hippocampal and hippocampal-cortical circuits [4, 7, 8] ."

In 268 contrast, the secretion of ZIKV NS1 was found to be insensitive to BFA and GCA treatment in 269 infected mosquito, but not in infected vertebrate cells (Fig 9B) . In addition, the secretion of ZIKV 270 NS1 was reduced in mosquito, but not in vertebrate cells, treated with the CyA inhibitor CsA (Fig   271 9C ). Co-localizations experiments carried out in C6/36, Aag2 and Vero-E6 cells infected with 272 ZIKV and YFV, showed a stronger, and a significantly different, co-localization between ZIKV 273 NS1 and CAV-1 than between YFV NS1 and CAV-1, in both mosquito cell lines. No co-274 localization of ZIKV or YFV NS1 with CAV-1 was observed in vertebrate cell line ( Fig 9D and 275 9E). Of note, the co-localization data support the predictions derived from the presence of a 276 conserved caveolin binding (CBD) domain in ZIKV (and DENV) but not in YFV NS1 (Fig 9F) .

Molecular docking predicts a favorable 290 interaction between the NS1 hydrophobic domain including the grease fingers, where the CBD 291 is located, with a pocket in the CAV-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) with distances less 8Ǻ ( Fig 9A   292 and 9B). The molecular docking results obtained with CAV-1 and NS1 were used as a control to 293 carry on additional docking experiments between the DENV NS1 or CAV-1 and the CCC 294 chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA. Calculations of the energy binding of several docking 295 clusters showed that the DENV NS1 has the lowest and more favorable energy for CAV-1, 296 compared to the energy binding obtained for FKBP52, Cy40 or CyA. In addition, lower energies 297 were obtained for the binding of CAV-1 with the other chaperones of the CCC, than for the 298 binding of NS1 with those same chaperones ( Fig 9C) . Based in the free energies data, we predict 299 a model of interaction of NS1 with the CCC proteins in which FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA are directly 300 bound to CAV-1, and NS1 is bound to the CCC through the CAV-1 scaffolding domain ( Fig 9D) .

Therefore, in the present work, we explored the association of NS1 with 307 proteins involved, together with CAV-1, in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and the 308 dependence of NS1 secretion on such association. The results revealed that NS1 is associated 309 to the chaperone caveolin complex (CAV-1, Cy40, FKBP52 and CyA) and that the integrity of 310 this complex is necessary for the secretion of NS1 in mosquito infected cells. Additional data 311 suggest that in virus infected mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1, but not yellow fever virus NS1, also 312 associates with CAV-1 and usurps the cholesterol traffic pathways for secretion. Thus, the lipid 313 content or molecular structure of the DENV NS1 seems to have taken advantage of mosquito 314 cell cholesterol transport to guarantee the efficient NS1 secretion in the mosquito vector.

The secretion of luciferase was significantly affected after treatment 329 with GCA and BFA (data not shown); these data, together with the observed inhibition of viral 330 particle release, indicates the existence of a robust classical secretion pathway in mosquito cells.

Further analysis also showed, high energy binding 372 through hydrophobic dynamics, between the NS1 -roll domain and FKBP52, CyA and Cy40 373 with distances under 6Ǻ. However, the model predicts all these proteins interacting at the same 374 domain in NS1 (data not shown), which seems unlikely, due to steric effects. Thus, we favor an 375 alternative molecular docking model, based on interaction energies, in which NS1 is bound 376 directly to CAV-1, and in turn FKBP52, CyA and Cy40 are bound to CAV-1 (Fig. 10D ). This 377 model still allowed interaction of NS1 with the CCC through membranes. However, if the NS1-378 CCC complex will traffic to the plasma membrane as a free-cytosolic complex or membrane 379 associated is totally unknown.

HUMAN BOCAVIRUS PREVALENCE IN CHILDREN WITH ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTHEN REGION OF SOUTH AFRICA Running Head: Human Bocavirus in children with AGE,BACKGROUND: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus globally associated with diarrhea. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in children (≤5 years) from rural communities in South Africa (SA) suffering from AGE.,"Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is recognized as one of major causes of mortality in children ≤5 years of age in Africa and other developing countries (1, 2). AGE can be caused by several viral pathogens including Human Bocavirus (HBoV), which is an emerging viral agent reported as a potential cause of diarrhea, especially in young children (3, 4) ."
Speed and strength of an epidemic intervention,"An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number R). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of ""test-and-treat"" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","An epidemic can be described by its speed and strength. The speed of an epidemic is characterized by the exponential growth rate r, which measures how fast an epidemic grows at the population level. The strength of an epidemic is characterized by the reproductive number R, which measures how many new cases are caused by a typical individual case. Knowing the speed and strength of an epidemic allows predictions about the course of the epidemic and the effectiveness of intervention strategies."
Existing host range mutations constrain further emergence of RNA viruses,"RNA viruses are capable of rapid host shifting, typically due to a point mutation that confers expanded host range. As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the dsRNA bacteriophage phi6 (wildtype and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens (PA). Sanger sequencing of fifty PA mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing both revealed the same high frequency mutations allowing infection of PA. Wildtype phi6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wildtype clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wildtype phi6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12 and two others had point mutations in p9 and p5 -none of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in phi6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion.","new genes involved in phi6 host range expansion, expanding our knowledge of this important model system in experimental evolution.

"Original investigation Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 . A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083).","Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan has infected more than 70,000 individuals. China has taken active and effective actions to provide medical support for aiding in the control of the rapid spread of COVID-19. From January 24, 2020 (Chinese New Year's Eve), China has sent more than 30,000 medical staff to Wuhan city and Hubei province to provide medical support. Researchers have validated that these efficient and feasible strategies and measures are timely and effective. Medical staffs often have a variety of psychological problems under a high-pressure and risk anti-pandemic situation. 1 Therefore, psychological assessment and intervention in victims and rescuers, such as medical staff and volunteers, are of great importance for the control of large-scale disasters and pandemics. This notion is not only beneficial for early actions and measures for psychological intervention, but also for tremendously improving disaster and pandemic control and rapid social recovery. 2 In 1996, Saakvitne and Pearlman first proposed vicarious traumatization (VT). 3 The term initially referred to the phenomenon where professional psychotherapists are involuntarily affected by the bidirectional interactions of the relationship between consultation and interview due to long-term contact with patients with mental diseases."
The effects of modified sialic acids on mucus and erythrocytes on influenza A virus HA and NA functions,"Sialic acids (Sia) are the primary receptors for influenza viruses, and are widely displayed on cell surfaces and in secreted mucus. Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including α2-3 or α2-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-30 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes Nglycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc 35 modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and 40 O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites.

Evaluation of the clinical characteristics of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 during home care with isolation: A new retrospective analysis based on O2O,"The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients.","The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide and has been classified as a public health emergency of international concern (PHIEC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 By 24:00 on February 16, 2020, 70,548 confirmed cases, 10,644 severe cases, 1,770 deaths, and 546,016 close contact cases have been identified in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of China. 2 The SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia has rapidly spread from Wuhan to 21 other countries, including the United States, Japan, Italy and Germany 3, 4 , demonstrating high levels of infectivity and pathogenicity. [5] [6] [7] The fever clinic of Tongji hospital in Wuhan has been the center of this outbreak. During the early phase of this outbreak, a large number of patients poured into the fever clinic, which far exceeded the medical resources that the hospital could equip. The medical staff were obviously insufficient to cope with it, and were prone to a wide range of cross-infection between doctors and patients. Based on this situation many patients had to be quarantined at home due to objective reasons and could not receive effective medical guidance. Therefore, we developed a new treatment method based on the online-to-offline (O2O) business model 8 for close contact, suspected (currently known as clinical diagnosis) and confirmed patients that were under quarantine. We developed a medical observation scale according to the patients' first symptoms and new symptoms which can be filled out by the patients on their smartphones or computers. Our online multidisciplinary team (medicine, rehabilitation, psychology and nursing) can then provide guidance and advice for patients based on the subjective changes in their symptoms. This method ensures that the patients follow an orderly treatment-seeking strategy that begins from their home and extends to the community and finally to the hospital. Our strategy not only helps relief the problem of scarce medical resources and reduce unnecessary cross-infection in hospitals, but it also increases people's self-management ability and cooperation and encourages them to participate in health monitoring. In addition, in accordance with the guidelines of home care for isolation patients issued by WHO 9 , the infection of family members was not increased during the strict self-isolation at home in this study."
Structure and immune recognition of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is an alphacoronavirus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pigs. A key determinant of viral tropism and entry, the PEDV spike protein is a key target for the host antibody response and a good candidate for a protein-based vaccine immunogen. We used electron microscopy to evaluate the PEDV spike structure, as well as pig polyclonal antibody responses to viral infection. The structure of the PEDV spike reveals a configuration similar to that of HuCoV-NL63. Several PEDV protein-protein interfaces are mediated by non-protein components including a glycan at Asn264 and two bound palmitoleic acid molecules. The polyclonal antibody response to PEDV infection shows a dominance of epitopes in the S1 region. This structural and immune characterization provides new insights into coronavirus spike stability determinants and explores the immune landscape of viral spike proteins. : bioRxiv preprint","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is a coronavirus of the alphacoronavirus genus. Identified as a viral agent distinct from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Wood, 1977) and as a coronavirus (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) , this virus is responsible for an enteric infection in pigs. Originally identified in England (Wood, 1977) , PEDV is now a global pathogen. PEDV was first identified in the United States in 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013) where it swept through pig populations causing several million piglet deaths (Sawyer and Sherwell, 2014) . Mortality due to viral infection varies with age, with mortalities of 1-3 day old piglets in naïve herds approaching 100% (Lee, 2015) . While mortality due to PEDV infection is lower in older pigs, infection can still result in decreased growth performance."
Title: Close contacts and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China: a content analysis based on local Heath Commissions' public disclosures,"+ These first authors contributed equally to this article BACKGROUND As of February 29, 2020, nearly 80 thousand confirmed novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection cases had been reported in China. Risk factors for transmission remain largely uncharacterized. The reproduction of infection can be characterized in two major scenarios, i.e., within-households and between-households [1]. Within-household transmission provides important information of infections cross age groups and genders. Estimation of the within-household transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is particularly important for disease control to characterize whether household contact might be driving the outbreak. If it transpires that virus is prone to transmit to a particular age group or gender, then special measures can be taken to control the transmission [2]. This study describes the transmission of the virus within households and close contacts.","Confirmed cases of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China were reported daily by city or provincial Health Commissions (HCs) of China, disclosing detailed information on individual cases' demographic features, travel traces and potential exposure to virus sources. 8,524 cases were reported in the public disclosure starting from January 24 to February 19.

Discovered in 1969 [2], LF is endemic to much of rural Nigeria and regions in the Mano River Union [3] . LASV transmits from human to human, as well as via the zoonotic cycle [1, 3, 4] . LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings [1, 4, 5] . The common reservoir of LASV is Mastomys natalensis, one of the most widespread rodent species in sub-Saharan Africa [1, 3] , which exhibit sensitive population dynamics to water level [6, 7] . Previous studies have recognized the ecological connection between the population levels of rodents and rainfall [8] [9] [10] ."
Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis,"Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called 'quasispecies'. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.","Coronaviruses (subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped positive-sense (+) single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses that infect a variety of mammalian and avian hosts and are of significant medical and economic importance, as illustrated by recent zoonotic transmissions from diverse animal hosts to humans 1, 2 . The genome sizes of coronaviruses (∼30 kb) exceed those of most other RNA viruses. Coronaviruses use a special mechanism called discountinuous extension of minus strands 3, 4 to produce a nested set of 5'and 3'-coterminal subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that carry a common 5' leader sequence that is identical to the 5' end of the viral genome 5, 6 . These sg mRNAs contain a different number of open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the viral structural proteins and several Figure 1 : Scheme of genomic and subgenomic (sg) RNAs produced in HCoV-229E-infected cells 7, 8 . Translation of the 5'-terminal ORF(s) of the respective RNA gives rise to the various viral structural and nonstructural proteins (indicated by different colors). RNA 3 is considered defective and unlikely to be translated into protein. Each RNA has a 3' poly(A) tail and carries a 5'-leader sequence that is identical to the 5'-end of the genome. In a process called discontinuous extension of negative strands, negative-strand RNA synthesis is attenuated at specific genomic positions. After transfer of the nascent strand to an upstream position on the template, RNA synthesis is continued by copying the 5'-leader sequence. As a result, the 3'-ends of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs are equipped with the complement of the 5'-leader. The latter process is guided by base-pairing interactions between the transcriptionregulating sequence (TRS) located immediately downstream of the leader sequence (TRS-L) at the 5'-end of the genome and the sequence complement of a TRS located upstream of one of the ORFs present in the 3'-proximal genome region (TRS-B)."
Microbiota-independent antiviral protection conferred by aminoglycoside antibiotics 1 2,"Antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in humans. However, the impact of antibiotic 27 use on host cells is understudied. We have identified a novel antiviral effect of commonly 28 used aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Deoxynivalenol Promotes Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection and 2 Aggravates Gut Barrier Injury,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogenic virus that 24 causes severe diarrhea and dehydration in pigs of all ages. Deoxynivalenol (DON), the 25 most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals 26 and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains 27 unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of 28 PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-29 seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, 30 receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 μg/kg DON, respectively. We 31 observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and 32 the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in 33 experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like 34 vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in 35 experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 36 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM DON promoted PEDV entry (P < 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted 37 in tight junction protein occludin internalization.

Dysregulation of Long Non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Genes and Predicted lncRNA-protein Interactions during Zika Virus Infection,"Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a causative agent for poor pregnancy outcome and fetal developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly and eye defects. As a result, ZIKV is now a confirmed teratogen. Understanding host-pathogen interactions, specifically cellular perturbations caused by ZIKV, can provide novel therapeutic targets. In order to complete viral replication, viral pathogens control the host cellular machineries and regulate various factors, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, at transcriptional levels. The role of lncRNA genes in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-mediated microcephaly and eye defects is currently unknown. To gain additional insights, we focused on profiling the differentially expressed lncRNA genes during ZIKV infection in mammalian cells. For this study, we employed a contemporary clinical Zika viral isolate, PRVABC59, of Asian genotype. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile the lncRNA transcriptome in ZIKV infected Vero cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that are differentially regulated at 48 hours post-infection. The majority of these genes are independently validated by reverse-transcription qPCR. A notable observation was that the lncRNAs, MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) and NEAT1 (Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1), are down-regulated upon Zika viral infection. MALAT1 and NEAT1 are known as nuclear localized RNAs that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation. Protein-lncRNA interaction maps revealed that MALAT1 and NEAT1 share common interacting partners and form a larger network comprising of 71 cellular factors. ZIKV-mediated dysregulation of these two regulatory lncRNAs can alter the expression of respective target genes and associated biological functions, an important one being cell division. In conclusion, this investigation is the first to provide insight into the biological connection of lncRNAs and ZIKV which can be further explored for developing antiviral therapy and understanding fetal developmental processes.","The human mosquito-borne pathogen, Zika Virus (ZIKV), is strongly associated with fetal developmental abnormalities, such as microcephaly and eye defects, as well as poor pregnancy outcomes [1] [2] [3] .

Comparative analysis reveals adaptive evolution of bat IFITMs and a novel 1 antiviral determinant,"doi: bioRxiv preprint 65 required for the antiviral activity of both IFITM3 and IFITM1 [9]. The subcellular localization of 66 IFITMs is a key determinant of their antiviral profile. When expressed singly, IFITM3 and IFITM2 67 preferentially localize to early and late endosomes and lysosomes, and restrict viruses that enter via 68 these endo-lysosomal compartments. In contrast, IFITM1 primarily localizes at the cell surface and 69 can restrict viruses that enter through the plasma membrane [11-14]. Indeed, mutants of IFITM3 70 that lack an N-terminal endocytic sorting motif 20 YEML 23 localize to the plasma membrane and lose 71 their ability to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV), alphavirus and coronavirus infection by endosomal 72 routes [14-18]. 73 74 Studies focusing on IFITM3 restriction of IAV and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) indicate that virus 75 internalization is unaffected by IFITM3 expression and, for SFV at least, the viral envelope 76 .

Ensemble Feature Selection and Meta-Analysis of Cancer miRNA Biomarkers,"The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cellular processes captured the attention of many researchers, since their dysregulation is shown to affect the cancer disease landscape by sustaining proliferative signaling, evading program cell death, and inhibiting growth suppressors. Thus, miRNAs have been considered important diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for several types of tumors. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be able to exploit the information contained in thousands of miRNAs to accurately predict and classify cancer types. Nevertheless, extracting the most relevant miRNA expressions is fundamental to allow human experts to validate and make sense of the results obtained by automatic algorithms. We propose a novel feature selection approach, able to identify the most important miRNAs for tumor classification, based on consensus on feature relevance from high-accuracy classifiers of different typologies. The proposed methodology is tested on a real-world dataset featuring 8,129 patients, 29 different types of tumors, and 1,046 miRNAs per patient, taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A new miRNA signature is suggested, containing the 100 most important oncogenic miRNAs identified by the presented approach. Such a signature is proved to be sufficient to identify all 29 types of cancer considered in the study, with results nearly identical to those obtained using all 1,046 features in the original dataset. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of the medical literature is performed to find references to the most important biomarkers extracted by the methodology. Besides known oncomarkers, 15 new miRNAs previously not ranked as important biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in cancer pathologies are uncovered. Such miRNAs, considered relevant by the machine learning algorithms, but still relatively unexplored by specialized literature, could provide further insights in the biology of cancer.","1 Several studies have shown the properties of microRNA types (miRNAs) as oncogenes 2 and tumor suppressors [1] [2] [3] . Since then, many sophisticated techniques, such as 3 high-throughput technologies, microarray, mass spectrometry and especially the Next 4 Generation Sequencing (NGS), have been developed for their identification [4] . However, 5 it is clear that the development of computational tools is needed for the interpretation 6 of results from these high-throughput experiments [5] . Indeed, computational assisted 7 methods are used for the identification of miRNAs from different genome organisms, for 8 example in Caenorhabditis briggsae [6] and in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4), a 9 member of the human herpesvirus (HHV) [7] . Furthermore, several computational 10 techniques can be applied to accurately predict miRNA expressions, as seen for example 11 in [8] . 12 Succeeding the earliest evidence of miRNA involvement in human cancer by Croce 13 and collaborators [9] , various studies demonstrate that miRNA expression is deregulated 14 in human cancer through diverse mechanisms [10] . Additionally, in comparison to the 15 impractical and invasive methods currently used for cancer diagnosis [11, 12] , miRNA 16 biomarkers can be detected directly from biological fluids (such as blood, urine, saliva 17 and pleural fluid [13] ), and they can also be used as biomarkers to detect tumors at an 18 early stage, which is extremely important for survival. For example, the 5-year survival 19 rate for lung cancer is 5%, but an early diagnosis can boost it to almost 50% [14] . Thus, 20 miRNA expression profiles correlate with clinical variables, highlighting their potential 21 value as prognostic and/or diagnostic tools. 22 In such a context of increasing availability of data, it is of utmost practical 23 importance to build databases of miRNA expressions data for cancer research [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , 24 and also to extract features that could be used as cancer biomarkers [20] [21] [22] . For 25 example, miRNA hsa-mir-21 is mentioned as a marker for patients with squamous cell 26 lung carcinoma [23], with astrocytoma [24], breast cancer [25] , and gastric cancer [26] . 27 Following this idea, the scientific community is currently looking for miRNA signatures, 28 representing the minimal number of miRNAs to be measured for discriminating between 29 different stages and types of cancer. 30 Current NGS technologies such as Applied Biosystems, SOLiD3,or HiSeq from 31 Illumina are able to extract thousands of components in genome sequences [27] , and 32 traditional linear statistical analysis are not suited to manage such quantities of 33 most relevant miRNAs to use as biomarkers for cancer classification. Typically, 39 classifiers trained on a dataset will not use the whole set of available features to 40 separate classes, but just a subset which could be ordered by relative importance, with 41 a different meaning given to the list by the specific technique. The top 100 biomarkers 42 in the list are then evaluated as a potential reduced signature for classification. Finally, 43 the top 50 miRNAs are compared to a meta-analysis of the medical literature, to 44 validate the results automatically produced by the machine learning algorithms. 45 Unsurprisingly, most of the miRNAs identified by the classifiers are also considered 46 important by the specialized literature: 15 of them, however, are still understudied, and 47 they could thus represent promising leads for future exploration. 48 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The target dataset and the proposed 49 approach are detailed in Section 2. Experimental results are reported in Section 3, while 50 Section 4 concludes the paper. 51 "
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: The species and its viruses -a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group,"The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location.

"Prediction of COVID-19 Spreading Profiles in South Korea, Italy and Iran by Data-Driven Coding","This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.","The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious disease, which began to spread in China in mid December 2019 [1] , and as the volume of intercity travel escalated around the Lunar New Year period, the number of infected individuals began to soar in mid January 2020.

Moreover, Iran would have around 14,450 infected individuals, i.e., 0.018% of its population, of which around 2,498 and 1,698 will be expected in Tehran and Zanjan (i.e., 0.39% and 0.2% of the city's population). In addition, the number of people infected in most other cities would be fewer than 1,000 (<0.1% of the city's population).

Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Severe Illness Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the Early Stage,Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence.,"Coronavirus was a large virus family, which was known to cause common cold and serious illness such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [1] [2] [3] [4] It was found that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the cause of unexplained viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020. In the following month, 2019-nCoV was transmitted in Hubei Province, throughout China and even other countries, 5 causing 34,662 confirmed cases by February 8, 2020."
Tuning antiviral CD8 T-cell response via proline-altered peptide ligand vaccination,"Viral escape from CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses correlates with disease progression and 6 represents a significant challenge for vaccination.

The APL 9 increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell 10 receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC 11 complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that 12 although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations 13 of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR 14 recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, 15 and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent 16 viral immune escape.

Next, P14 TCR down-regulation was assessed upon exposure to gp33, V3P, Y4F or PF-loaded H-120 2D b+ RMA cells (Fig. 1C) . While H-2D b /gp33 induced significant TCR down-regulation, none 121 was detected with Y4F, even at high peptide concentrations. Exposure of P14 T cells to V3P 122 equaled or increased TCR internalization compared to gp33. Importantly, exposure to PF 123 significantly increased P14 TCR down-regulation compared to Y4F (Fig. 1C) .

This is well in line with previous studies in which the Y4F-specific T cell 174 clone YF.F3 killed efficiently targets presenting gp33 but did not produce IFNg [32] . Similar 175 results were obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-derived T cells (Fig. S4 ). In conclusion, The p3P modification facilitates TCR recognition 209 The three ternary TCR/MHC/peptide structures were compared with each corresponding TCR-210 unbound pMHC (Fig. 4, Fig. S8 ). The side chain of p4Y, essential for recognition by P14 [4, 33, 211 34], rotates down following P14 binding to both H-2D b /gp33 and H-2D b /V3P (Fig. 4A-B) . A 212 similar rotation was also observed for residue p4F in H-2D b /PF upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4C) . 213 The side chain of p6F in gp33 is also affected upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the 214 p3P modification resulted in a similar conformation for p6F in both H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF 215 prior to binding to P14 ( Fig. 1D and Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the side chain of residue p1K in H-216 2D b /gp33 also moves towards the N-terminal of the peptide binding cleft following P14 binding 217 (Fig. 4A) , taking an identical conformation as in both p3P-substituted peptides (Fig. 4D) .

In contrast to gp33, the p2-p4 section is more constrained in both V3P and PF, 223 following TCR binding (Fig. 4B, 4C ). However, it should be noted that the final conformations of 224 all three peptides in the ternary complexes is nearly identical (Fig. 4D ). In conclusion, residues 1 225 and 6 in p3P-APLs take the same conformations prior to TCR binding as found in the ternary 226 complexes, potentially enabling a more favorable surface for P14 TCR binding. Furthermore, p1K in gp33 also takes a different conformation upon binding to P14, bending 239 backwards towards the H-2D b residues R62 and E163, which conformations are affected (Fig. 4A , 240 5A). Here again, the side chain of p1K takes exactly this conformation in both V3P and PF already 241 before TCR binding (Fig. 4, 5) . Altogether, p1K, P6F and heavy chain residues R62, H155 and 242 E163 have already adopted in the unbound V3P and PF complexes similar conformations to those 243 observed in all three ternary structures (Fig. 4, 5) . Thus, the p3P substitution potentially facilitates 244 TCR recognition by positioning specific key peptide and MHC residues prior to the formation of 245 .

The results presented within this study indicate in our opinion that i) docking of P14 to p3P-331 modified peptides is facilitated since the conformations of key residues in both peptide and heavy 332 chain are already optimal prior to TCR binding (ready-to-go conformation); ii) consequently, the 333 energetic costs for TCR recognition should be reduced since there is no need for any major 334 movement in the rigidified epitope besides the conformational change for residue p4Y.

"Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak.","Emerging infectious diseases are still great challenges in the 21st century. In recent years, worldwide outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused great health and economic losses [1] [2] [3] . The reported 27 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and many cases were related to the Wuhan Southern China Seafood Market, which was subsequently closed on January 1, 2020 4 . On January 7, 2020, laboratory test results showed that the pathogen of unexplained pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus, which was then officially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) 5, 6 . The 2019-nCoV outbreak started in Wuhan, and then spread rapidly to other provinces and countries 7, 8 . As of January 30, 2020, a total of 34 provinces and regions in China have reported 9,692 cases. Nearly all imported cases were derived from Wuhan, Hubei province 9, 10 . The 2019-nCoV pneumonia was defined as a class B infectious disease but managed as class A infectious disease by the Chinese government. Daily case reports are being released and any omission or concealment is punishable by law. At present, the number of cases is still increasing and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak, but the situation differs by province. ."
Nuclease escape elements protect messenger RNA against cleavage by multiple viral endonucleases 2 3,15,"including the SOX homologs [1, 9, 21, 40, 41] . Thus, the IL-6 derived SRE is unlikely to 144 function through steric occlusion of a common cleavage site. We instead considered the 145 possibility that the SRE functions like an RNA 'zip code', directing its associated transcript 146 to a location in the cell inaccessible to endonucleases. To test this hypothesis, we used RNA 147 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to monitor how the presence of the IL-6 SRE 148 impacted the localization of its associated mRNA. Six phage MS2-derived stem-loops were 149 introduced upstream of the SRE or ΔSRE segment of the IL-6 3' UTR in the pcDNA3 150 luciferase reporter, enabling visualization of the RNA in transfected 293T cells using a Cy3-151 labeled RNA probe directed against the MS2 sequences [42] . We verified that the presence 152 of the stem-loops did not prevent the escape of the SRE-containing reporter or degradation 153 of the ΔSRE reporter in SOX-expressing cells (Fig. S1) . There was no distinguishable 154 difference in the localization of the SRE and ΔSRE containing mRNAs, both of which were 155 present relatively diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 1C) . The FISH signal was specific to 156 transfected cells, as we observed no fluorescence in neighboring untransfected cells nor 157 autofluorescence from transfected cells lacking the Cy3 probes (Fig. 1C) . Although these 158 data to not exclude the possibility that the SRE-containing transcript became sequestered 159 into micro-aggregates or other structures not visible at this level of resolution, they do not 160 support relocalization as the driver of escape from viral endonuclease cleavage. 161 162 We next considered whether the inability to cleave an IL-6 SRE-containing 163 transcript was specific to viral endonucleases or similarly extended to host endonucleases. 164"
D R A F T Inferring transmission trees to guide targeting of interventions against visceral leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis,"Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.",". PKDL has therefore been recognised as a major 49 potential threat to the VL elimination programme in the ISC 50 (10), which has led to increased active PKDL case detection. 51 Nevertheless, the contribution of PKDL to transmission in 52 field settings still urgently needs to be quantified. 53 Although the incidence of asymptomatic infection is 4 to 54 17 times higher than that of symptomatic infection in the 55 ISC (21), the extent to which asymptomatic individuals con- (Fig. 1A) . The data from this study are fully de-105 scribed elsewhere (8, 31) . Briefly, month of onset of symptoms, 106 treatment, relapse, and relapse treatment were recorded for 107 VL cases and PKDL cases with onset between 2002 and 2010 108 (retrospectively for cases with onset before 2007), and year of 109 onset was recorded for VL cases with onset before 2002. There 110 were 1018 VL cases and 190 PKDL cases with onset between 111 January 2002 and December 2010 in the study area, and 413 112 VL cases with onset prior to January 2002. 113 Over the whole study area, VL incidence followed an epi-114 demic wave, increasing from approximately 40 cases/10,000/yr 115 in 2002 to ≥90 cases/10,000/yr in 2005 before declining to 116 <5 cases/10,000/yr in 2010 (Fig. 1B) . PKDL incidence fol-117 lowed a similar pattern but lagging VL incidence by roughly 118 2yrs, peaking at 30 cases/10,000/yr in 2007. However, VL 119 and PKDL incidence varied considerably across paras (aver-120 age para-level incidences: VL 18-124 cases/10,000/yr, PKDL 121 0-31 cases/10,000/yr, Table S5 ) and time (range of annual 122 para-level incidences: VL 0-414 cases/10,000/yr, PKDL 0-120 123 cases/10,000/yr, Fig. S15 ). ú CI = credible interval, calculated as the 95% highest posterior density interval † risk of subsequent VL/asymptomatic infection if susceptible ‡ based on assumed infectiousness § in the absence of background transmission and relative to living directly outside the case household."
Fast assessment of human receptor-binding capability of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"The outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this","Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-stranded enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, and are classified into four genera: a, b, d and g. Two of the b-CoVs, the server acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have caused serious epidemics. In November 2002, SARS emerged in southern China and then was spreading across the world in 2003, resulting in ~8,000 cases with a fatality rate of about 10% (WHO, 2004) . Ten years later, MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia and spread to different countries with a fatality rate of about 35% (WHO, 2016) . Both viruses are of zoonotic nature: SARS-CoV originates from bats/civet cats (Ge et al., 2013) , and the major reservoir for MERS-CoV is dromedary camels (Reusken et al., 2016) . Nevertheless, both viruses can be transmitted from human to human (de Wit et al., 2016) ."
A hidden gene in astroviruses encodes a cell-permeabilizing protein involved in virus release,"Human astroviruses are small nonenveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that contain three main open reading frames: ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. Astroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide and have been associated with encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Through comparative genomic analysis of >400 astrovirus sequences, we identified a conserved ""ORFX"" overlapping the capsid-encoding ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. ORFX appears to be subject to purifying selection, consistent with it encoding a functional protein product, termed XP. Using ribosome profiling of cells infected with human astrovirus 1, we confirm initiation at the ORFX AUG.",Humans astroviruses (HAstVs) belong to genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae.
Multivariate Analyses of Codon Usage of SARS-CoV-2 and other 1 betacoronaviruses,11,"A novel coronavirus outbreak took place in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 31 2019 1 . This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in patients 2 and it has 32 rapidly spread to other provinces in China and other countries 3 . This novel coronavirus 33 outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission 34 route of the pathogen is still limited. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, 35 which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 36 Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine and hedgehog, can be 37 infected by different types of coronaviruses. Further sequence analyses of this novel and 38 other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the 39 evolution of SARS-CoV-2. 40 Preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms, and it has been evident 41 that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection 42 pressures 4-6 . There are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at amino acid level and the 43 other is at synonymous codon level. The amino acid composition of proteins can be an 44 important factor that explaining certain sequence traits. For example integral membrane 45 proteins that are enriched in hydrophobic amino acids can create significant codon usage 46 bias 7 . Amino acid composition sometime can also introduce confounding effects when one 47 only focuses on studying the variations of synonymous codon usage. The use of global 48 correspondence analysis (CA) and its derivatives within-group correspondence analysis 49 (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) to analyze codon usages can 50 overcome the above problem. In fact, WCA becomes ""model of choice"" for analyzing 51 synonymous codon usage in recent years, as it is more robust than other traditional methods 52 (e.g. CA with relative codon frequency or CA with RSCU values) 7,8 . This analytic approach, 53 however, has not been used in studying viral sequences. As the natural history of the SARS- 54 CoV-2 remains largely unknown, an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging 55 virus might provide some novel insights. 56 In this study, we used both CA and WCA to analyses codon usage patterns of a vast number 57 of betacoronavirus sequences. We found SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARSr-CoV have similar 58 amino acid usage. However, our analyses suggested that the spike and member genes of 59 SARS-CoV-2 have rather distinct synonymous codon usage patterns. Table S1 . 86 The codon count for every gene sequence input for the correspondence analysis was All the correspondence analyses in this study were performed individually for each gene, to 103 achieve better resolution on gene specific codon usage pattern. Gravy score provides an easy way to estimate the hydropathy character of a protein 15 . It was 117 used in this study as a proxy to identify proteins that are likely to be membrane-bound 118 proteins. The GRAVY score was calculated in a linear form on codon frequencies as: The overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order 140 ( Figure 1 ). We observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino 141 acids in the four studied genes, while tryptophan, histidine and methionine were the three 142 least used ones. We also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally 143 less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine. This pattern of uneven usage 144 in synonymous codons is in accordance with the G + C content distribution results (codons 145 ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observed). 146 We found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes, and this bias is well 147 explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins (results from global correspondence 148 analysis on all the four genes, collectively, data not shown).

CRISPR-based surveillance for COVID-19 using genomically-comprehensive machine learning design,"The emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific tools to surveil circulating viruses.

Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study,"Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13 th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.","As of 13 th February 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 46,997 confirmed cases (1) .

The majority of internationally exported cases reported to date have a travel history to Wuhan (2) . In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. In particular, estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the current epidemiological situation (3) and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect (4, 5) . Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth (6) , help estimate risk to other countries (7) , and guide the design of alternative interventions (8) ."
Evolved sequence features within the intrinsically disordered tail influence FtsZ assembly and bacterial cell division,"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) challenge the well-established sequence-structurefunction paradigm for describing protein function and evolution. Here, we direct a combination of biophysical and cellular studies to further our understanding of how the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of FtsZ contributes to cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. FtsZ is a modular protein that encompasses a conserved GTPase domain and a highly variable intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). The CTT is essential for forming the cytokinetic Z-ring. Despite poor sequence conservation of the CTT, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, which refers to the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within CTT sequences is bounded within a narrow range. To assess the impact of evolutionary bounds on charge patterning within CTT sequences we performed experiments, aided by sequence design, to quantify the impact of changing the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTT on the functions of FtsZ from B. subtilis. Z-ring formation is robust if and only if the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequences is within evolutionarily observed bounds. Otherwise, aberrant, CTT-mediated, FtsZ assemblies impair Zring formation. The complexities of CTT sequences also have to be above a threshold value because FtsZ variants with low complexity CTTs are not tolerated in cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CTT sequences have evolved to be ""just right"" and that this is achieved through an optimal extent of charge patterning while maintaining the sequence complexity above a threshold value.","Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) feature prominently in eukaryotic proteins (Dunker et al., 2002a; van der Lee et al., 2014) . These regions are associated with a range of molecular functions that contribute to an assortment of cellular processes (Dunker et al., 2002b; Iakoucheva et al., 2002; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . IDRs and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) defy the well-established sequence-structure-function paradigm that provides a coherent framework for connecting sequence-encoded information to molecular functions for proteins that fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures (Babu, 2016) . This is because conformational heterogeneity is a defining hallmark of IDRs / IDPs (Babu et al., 2012; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Lyle et al., 2013; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . Despite this sequence-intrinsic conformational heterogeneity it has become clear that IDRs and IDPs have definable sequence-to-conformation relationships (Das et al., 2015; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Gibbs and Showalter, 2016) . The overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of IDRs / IDPs are governed by compositional parameters such as the fraction of charged residues and the overall proline contents (Hofmann et al., 2012; Holehouse et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2013; Muller-Spath et al., 2010) . Additional contributions to sequence-to-conformation relationships include the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues as well as the linear patterning of proline and charged residues Martin et al., 2016) ."

Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese 45 horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with 46 each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of 47 positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis 48 indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of 49 PyV than geographic distance.

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of 67 PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other 68 DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans.","Introduction 112 southwest (Yunnan and Guangxi), southeast (Fujian and Zhejiang) and northwest (Xinjiang) 113 provinces in China.

Metagenomic Nanopore sequencing of influenza virus 1 direct from clinical respiratory samples 2 3,"Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic variants, large 27 zoonotic reservoir, and pandemic potential.

The deubiquitinating activity of Middle East respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus papain-like protease delays the innate immune response 3 and enhances virulence in a mouse model 4 5 Robert,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause zoonotic infections 17 and serious disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, due to repeated spill-over from dromedary 18 camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission. Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or 19 humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like 20 protease (PL pro ) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing 21 functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PL pro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can 22 remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. 23 In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PL pro in complex with ubiquitin, 24 facilitating the design of PL pro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein 25 cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and 26 examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. 27 Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was 28 comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels 29 for interferon (IFN)-β and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the 30 survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic 31 mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV 32 replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, 33 likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to 34 delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first 35 direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion 36 and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate 37 immune-suppressive DUB activity of PL pro s is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the 38 context of rational vaccine development.",The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/751578 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 107
Rapid metagenomic characterization of a case of imported COVID-19 in Cambodia,"Rapid production and publication of pathogen genome sequences during emerging disease outbreaks provide crucial public health information.

Currently, incubation period and transmissibility are questions of global concern, but difficult to answer given nonspecific and mild symptoms that could represent a variety of respiratory viruses. 4, 5 Genetic characterization of the virus from geographically diverse patient samples is key to infer the rate of spread. Additionally, rapid and complete results from cases worldwide are important for sequence-dependent countermeasures and accurate diagnostics. However, as the virus reaches resource-limited settings in proximity to the outbreak's epicenter, such as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, there are often logistical challenges in surveillance, contact tracing, sample collection, and biospecimen transport. Information delay is also compounded by a dearth of sequencing and/or bioinformatics expertise in-country, further postponing analysis and dissemination of pathogen genomic information."
Evolutionary rate shifts suggest species-specific adaptation events 1 in HIV-1 and SIV 6,"The process of molecular adaptation following a cross-species virus transmission event is 9 currently poorly understood. Here, we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration 10 in their rate of evolution along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny, likely indicating gain-of-function and 11 consequent adaptation. The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species 12 transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation 13 strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in 14 accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors 15 are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-16 pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than 17 the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees. We suggest that the species barrier is higher 18 when the genetic distance of the hosts increases. Our approach paves the way for subsequent 19 studies on cross-species transfers in other major pathogens.","The Human Immunodeficiency Viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the causative agents of AIDS in 22 humans, infecting millions of people worldwide.

EPS8 facilitates uncoating of influenza A virus,"All viruses balance interactions between cellular machinery co-opted to support replication and host factors deployed to halt the infection. We used gene correlation analysis to perform an unbiased screen for host factors involved in influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection. Our screen identified the cellular factor epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8) as the highest confidence pro-viral candidate. Knockout and overexpression of EPS8 confirmed its importance in enhancing FLUAV infection and titers. Loss of EPS8 did not affect virion attachment, uptake, or fusion. Rather, our data show that EPS8 specifically functions during virion uncoating. EPS8 physically associated with incoming virion components, and subsequent nuclear import of released ribonucleoprotein complexes was significantly delayed in the absence of EPS8. Our study identified EPS8 as a host factor important for uncoating, a crucial step of FLUAV infection during which the interface between the virus and host is still being discovered.",Attachment and entry into a host cell is the first bottleneck virions encounter during infection. Virion entry requires efficient use of the host cell environment while simultaneously evading cellular immune responses.
Improving early epidemiological assessment of emerging Aedes-transmitted epidemics using historical data,"Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the rst few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedestransmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017","accounting for spatial and population structure [19] . But in addition to specifying a model, selecting good parameter values is also essential to obtain good predictions. In models for directly transmitted diseases, this can come from realistic demographic and behavioral characteristics, for example the contact frequency between individuals [20] , mobility patterns [21, 22, 23, 24] , and from clinical and epidemiological characteristics like the duration of the serial interval [25] . Such information is less easily available and more limited for mosquito-transmitted diseases [26] . However, outbreaks of the same disease or diseases with similar routes of transmission may have occurred in the same or similar locations, so that relevant information may be recovered from the analysis of past outbreaks."
Prediction of New Coronavirus Infection Based on a Modified SEIR Model,"BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation.","At the beginning of the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection, some cases were related to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei. At first, it was diagnosed as ""unexplained pneumonia"", but it quickly spread to all parts of the country and parts of Southeast Asia, North America, and Europe. Wuhan City, Hubei Province, as a place of communication between the nine provinces, the large population movement, the influence of geographical factors, and the transmission characteristics of the new coronavirus have added many difficulties to the prevention and control of the epidemic.

The demyelinating agent cuprizone induces a male-specific reduction in binge eating in 2 the binge-prone C57BL/6NJ strain 3 4,Binge eating (BE) is a heritable symptom of eating disorders with an unknown genetic etiology. 32,"Binge eating (BE) is operationally defined as the consumption of a relatively large amount 54 of food over a short period of time, and is accompanied by feelings of loss of control (Amianto, 55 Ottone, Abbate Daga, & Fassino, 2015) . Repeated BE that occurs at least once per week for at 56 least three months is termed binge eating disorder (BED).

"North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 125 Mason Farm Rd","Using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from poliovirus (PV) as our model system, we 26 have shown that Lys-359 in motif-D functions as a general acid in the mechanism of nucleotidyl 27 transfer. A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the 28 context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F 29 (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and 30 enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique 31 recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH 32 being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits 33 biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for 34 recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to 35 speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven 36 nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible 37 to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness.

Noroviruses subvert the core stress granule component G3BP1 to promote viral VPg-dependent translation,"Knowledge of the host factors required for norovirus replication has been hindered 2 by the challenges associated with culturing human noroviruses. We have combined 3 proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR 4 screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress 5 granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient 6 human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across 7 the Norovirus genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel 8 paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of 9 translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by 10 facilitating 40S recruitment. Our data suggest that G3BP1 functions by providing viral 11 RNA a competitive advantage over capped cellular RNAs, uncovering a novel 12 function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifying the 13 first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity. 14 15 16",3
Assessing Topographic Structural Connectivity of the Human Basal Ganglia and Thalamus,"The basal ganglia and thalamus play an important role in cognition, procedural learning, eye movements, control of voluntary motor movements, emotional control, habit development, and are structures that are severely impacted by neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or Tourette syndrome. To understand the structural connectivity of cortical and subcortical circuits in the healthy human brain could thus be of pivotal importance for detecting changes in this circuitry and to start early intervention, to assess the progress of movement rehabilitation, or the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatry. While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, or magnetoencephalography are able to provide detailed information about connectivity at the macro level, the sensitivity and specificity these imaging techniques put limits on the amount of detail one can obtain when measuring in vivo connectivity of human basal ganglia and thalamus. In contrast, the multiband diffusion echo planar imaging MRI sequence, which acquires multiple slices of the brain simultaneously, enables high resolution imaging of these brain structures with only short acquisition times at 3-Tesla field strength. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that allows us to generate comprehensive in vivo participant-specific probabilistic patterns and visualizations of the structural connections that exist within basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. Moreover, we are able to map specific parcellations of these nuclei into sub-territories based on their connectivity with primary motor-, and somatosensory cortex. The detailed subcortical structural connectivity mapping introduced in this work could benefit early intervention and therapy methods for human movement rehabilitation and for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. author/funder.

A binning tool to reconstruct viral haplotypes from assembled contigs,"Infections by RNA viruses such as Influenza, HIV still pose a serious threat to human health despite extensive research on viral diseases. One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. Results: We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction. Availability: https://github.com/chjiao/VirBin Contact: yannisun@cityu.edu.hk","High genetic diversity within viral populations has been observed in patients with chronic infection with RNA viruses such as HIV, HCV, etc (Sullivan et al., 2007; Perrin and Telenti, 1998) . The genetic diversity could be caused by multiple infections of different strains or by mutations during the virus replication inside the host. In the latter case, the high replication rate, coupled with the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses, results in a group of different but related strains infecting the same host, which is often termed as ""quasispecies"" (Nowak, 2006) . Previous studies have revealed that patients with chronic virus infections, such as AIDS, are often the reservoir of new viral variants, which are likely produced during the replication process (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2017) . Because different strains could have very different biological properties such as virulence, transmissibility, antiviral drug resistance etc, characterizing the genetic diversity within viral populations is very important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. For example, if some strains have developed antiviral drug resistance, they may become the dominant strains and lead to treatment failure. Thus, characterization of the strain-level diversity of viral populations is indispensable for understanding the viruses and is of great clinical importance."
"Molecular Modeling Evaluation of the Binding Effect of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Darunavir to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Proteases","Three anti-HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 . In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.","In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, and then quickly became a rising global concern since World Health Organization had declared it as the sixth public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020. By the time of 14:50 on February 8, 2020, 34638 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in China and 723 patients died from it, resulting in a mortality of 2.2%. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel species of non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus which can spread and distribute in humans and other mammals [1] . Previous studies have discovered that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a distinct clade from the β-coronavirus which is associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2] . Shi ZL et al found that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-related coronavirus and is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [3] , which corresponds to that the origin may be wild animals sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [4] . Recent clinical research found that dyspnea might occur on the fifth day and acute respiratory distress syndrome on the eighth day from first symptom of COVID-19 in median, organ dysfunction and death can also occur in severe COVID-19 cases [5, 6] . However, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19. Finding drugs that can fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a top priority."
Optimising Renewal Models for Real-Time Epidemic Prediction and Estimation,"The effective reproduction number, Rt, is an important prognostic for 2 infectious disease epidemics. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about 3 new transmissions or predict the efficacy of interventions. The renewal 4 model infers Rt from incidence data and has been applied to Ebola virus 5 disease and pandemic influenza outbreaks, among others. This model 6 estimates Rt using a sliding window of length k. While this facilitates 7 real-time detection of statistically significant Rt fluctuations, inference is 8 highly k -sensitive. Models with too large or small k might ignore meaning-9 ful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones. No principled k -selection 10 scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the ac-11 cumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory. We 12 derive exact incidence prediction distributions and integrate these within 13 an APE framework to identify the k best supported by available data. We 14 find that this k optimises short-term prediction accuracy and expose how 15 common, heuristic k -choices, which seem sensible, could be misleading. 16 18 fectious disease epidemic is known as an incidence curve or epi-curve [1]. At 19 the population level, these curves offer prospective insight into the spread of a 20 disease by informing on the effective reproduction number, which defines the 21 average number of secondary infections induced by a primary one [2]. This 22","The time-series of infected cases (infecteds) observed over the course of an in-are provided in the Methods. The APE uses the window of data preceding time 126 s, (I s s−k+1 , Λ s s−k+1 ), to predict the incidence at s + 1 and assigns a log-score to 127 this prediction. This procedure is repeated over s ≤ t and for possible k-values. 128 The k achieving the minimum cumulated log-score is deemed optimal. Fig. 1 129 illustrates the APE for selecting between two windows k 1 and k 2 . Figure 1 : Window length selection using APE. An observed incidence curve (blue dots) is sequentially and causally predicted over time s ≤ t, using effective reproduction number estimates based on two possible windows lengths of k 1 and k 2 (green shaded). The true reproduction number (R s ) is drawn in dashed black (inset). Its estimates for each window length areR τ1(s) (dark grey) andR τ2(s) (light grey). Large windows (k 1 ) smooth over fluctuations. Small ones (k 2 ) recover these changes but are noisy. The APE assesses k 1 and k 2 via the log-loss of their sequential predictions (red error bars shown for predictions at t 1 and t 2 under k 1 and k 2 respectively). The k-window with the smaller APE is better supported by this incidence curve. The algorithm parameters are defined in Results."
In-vivo targeted tagging of RNA isolates cell specific transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli and identifies liver-to-adipose RNA transfer 2 3,"Bio-fluids contain various circulating cell-free RNA transcripts (ccfRNAs). The composition of 20 these ccfRNAs varies between bio-fluids and constitute tantalizing biomarker candidates for 21 several pathologies. ccfRNAs have also been demonstrated as mediators of cellular 22 communication, yet little is known about their function in physiological and developmental 23 settings and most works are limited to in-vitro studies. Here, we have developed iTAG-RNA, a 24 novel method for the unbiased tagging of RNA transcripts in mice in-vivo. We used this method 25 to isolate hepatocytes and kidney proximal epithelial cells-specific transcriptional response to a 26 dietary challenge without interfering with the tissue architecture, and to identify multiple 27 hepatocyte-secreted ccfRNAs in plasma. We also identified transfer of these hepatic derived 28 ccfRNAs to adipose tissue, where they likely serve as a buffering mechanism to maintain 29 cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Our findings directly demonstrate in-vivo transfer of RNAs 30 between tissues and highlight its implications for endocrine signaling and homeostasis.","Small molecule design and genetic approach for targeted in-vivo labeling of RNA 93 5-Ethynyl Uridine (5EU) is a synthetic uridine analogue extensively used in RNA turnover studies 94 [27] [28] [29] . The nitrogenous base contains an alkyne group that can be covalently linked to an azide 95 group using a simple copper mediated reaction called click chemistry [30, 31] . This synthetic base 96 has been demonstrated to incorporate into transcribing RNA in place of uridine and have little to 97 no biological effects thereafter [27] . Following administration to mice, 5EU is readily taken up by 98 cells with no regard to cell identity, depending to some extent on the administration method and 99 dosage used [27] . Here, we present a novel method for the targeted in-vivo delivery of 5EU. 100 To achieve this, we designed a 'pro-drug' of the 5EU base (HD5EU) that is based on the 'Hep-101 Direct' pro-drug design [32, 33] (Figure 1a) . This design was developed to target small molecules 102 and nucleotide analogues to the human CYP3A4 enzyme and several small molecules of this 103 design have been or are currently in clinical studies [34] [35] [36] . The human CYP3A4 enzyme 104 catalyzes an oxidative cleavage of the HD5EU small molecule which, following a spontaneous 105 beta-elimination, results in the formation of 5EU mono-phosphate that can then be incorporated 106 into transcribing RNA (Figure 1a ). HD5EU was synthesized by Chiroblock GmbH, the identity 107 of the final product was validated using MS, p-NMR and h-NMR and the molecule's purity was 108 assessed at over 98% (Sup. Figure 1a-d) . 109 In addition to the HD5EU small molecule we took advantage of the published humanized liver 110 specific CYP3A4 mouse line FVB/129P2-Cyp3a13 tm1Ahs Del(5Cyp3a57-Cyp3a59) 1Ahs 111 Tg(APOE-CYP3A4) A1Ahs obtained from Taconic [37, 38] . These humanized mice (hCYP3A4) 112 express the human CYP3A4 enzyme under a modified Apolipoprotein E (APOE) promoter and 113 are stably knocked out for nine homologous murine genes, thus leaving the human enzyme as the 114 sole member of the enzyme family to be expressed in a Cre-independent, tissue-specific manner 115 in-vivo. In keeping with published data on the activity of the modified ApoE promoter [39] , qRT-116 PCR and WB analyses demonstrate restricted expression of the human Cyp3a4 enzyme to liver 117 and kidney (Figure 1b-c) . As such, upon administration of the HD5EU small molecule to the 118 humanized CYP3A4 mice, we expect the molecule to be metabolized to bioavailable 5EU mono- 143 To test and validate the metabolism of the HD5EU small molecule, we first isolated primary 144 hepatocytes from hCYP3A4 mice.

Of note, animals administered with 156 HD5EU did not demonstrate any visible side effects. In addition we could not detect any signs of 157 DNA damage or apoptosis in the liver during the different treatment regimens as demonstrated by 158 staining for phosph-P53 and cleaved Caspase-3, supporting HD5EU as a non-toxic agent (Sup To validate that nuclear staining evident in-vitro and in-vivo following HD5EU treatment is indeed 177 indicative of 5EU incorporation into transcribing RNA, we adopted the mass-spectrometry method 178 described by Su et. al [41] .

Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases,"Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV.

Sofosbuvir, a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue (Fig. 2) with a blocked phosphate group enabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, is a prodrug, which is converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 3) . The activated drug binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to modifications at the 2' position, inhibits further RNA chain extension and halts RNA replication. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides.

Infectious bronchitis virus regulates cellular stress granule signaling 1,"Viruses must hijack cellular translation machinery to efficiently express viral genes.

THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND IMPACT OF BACTERIAL tRNA 1 MODIFICATIONS 2,"Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the 12 tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific (""target"") tRNAs to 13 recognize multiple codons and cover for other (""non-target"") tRNAs, often improving translation 14 efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying 15 enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 16 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly 17 lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in non-target 18 tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome 19 reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene 20 repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing 21 the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation. 22 23","Compared to the total complement of 61 sense codons, most bacterial genomes contain only 25 -46 2 unique tRNA species (Grosjean, de Crécy-Lagard, & Marck, 2010) .

Comparative genomics reveals signature regions used to develop a robust and sensitive multiplex TaqMan real-time qPCR assay to detect the genus Dickeya and Dickeya dianthicola,"Dickeya species are high consequence plant pathogenic bacteria listed among the quarantine pathogens of the European Union; associated with potato disease outbreaks and subsequent economic losses worldwide. Early, accurate, and reliable detection of Dickeya spp. is needed to prevent establishment and further dissemination of this pathogen. Therefore, a multiplex TaqMan qPCR was developed for sensitive detection of Dickeya spp. and specifically, D. dianthicola.","The genus Dickeya belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae and is comprised of pectinolytic Gram negative plant pathogenic bacteria, responsible for the soft rot diseases worldwide. Due to their association with catastrophic diseases, Dickeya species have been listed among the top ten most destructive bacterial plant pathogens (Mansfield et al. 2012) . Soft rot Enterobacteria are also associated with the most serious problems facing potato production worldwide. The impact of soft rot disease varies from country to country; in the Netherlands, the annual estimated losses are around €30 million per year, while in Israel, potato yield losses of 20-25% have been observed. Symptoms caused by Dickeya spp. are more severe in high moisture and temperature environments (Czajkowski et al. 2009 ). Infected plants show stunting, chlorosis, wilting, black discoloration and soft rot, which begins at the stem base and progresses upward. Once infection has occurred, the pathogen colonizes the vascular tissues and moves throughout the plant (Raoul des Essarts et al. 2016); severe infections lead to whole plant collapse. Latent infections can result in severe losses during storage, especially in warehouses that lack refrigeration facilities (Laurila et al. 2008 ). In recent years, D. dianthicola has emerged as one of the most important pathogens infecting potatoes worldwide, and symptoms resemble those of blackleg caused by Pectobacterium species (Boluk and Arif 2019). Due to high economic impact in the European potato growing countries, D. dianthicola (syn. Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. dianthicola) has been listed in the EPPO A2 List of pests recommended for regulation as quarantine pests A2/53 (Pg 8); http://archives.eppo.int/EPPOStandards. At present, neither resistant varieties nor effective physical, chemical or biological controls have been reported to manage D. dianthicola diseases under field conditions (Czajkowski et al. 2014) . Only preventive measures are recommended, which include planting certified seeds, eradicating contaminated plant materials, screening for latent infections, monitoring appropriate storage conditions and inspecting fields (Motyka et al. 2017) . Therefore, early, accurate and sensitive detection of Dickeya species is important to identify inoculum sources before they become a problem.

TaqMan qPCR with the probes labelled with different fluorogenic dyes enables simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens or pests in a single tube (Arif et al. 2015) . Multiplex TaqMan can be very useful for detection of different Dickeya species, which produces nearly indistinguishable disease symptoms without compromising the sensitivity and specificity of the assay."

"Realized generation times: contraction and impact of infectious period, reproduction number and population size","One of the key characteristics of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is the generation time which refers to the time interval between the infection of a secondary case and the infection of its infector. The generation time distribution together with the reproduction number determines the rate at which an infection spreads in a population. When defining the generation time distribution at a calendar time t two definitions are plausible according whether we regard t as the infection time of the infector or the infection time of the infectee. The resulting measurements are respectively called forward generation time and backward generation time. It has been observed that the mean forward generation time contracts around the peak of an epidemic. This contraction effect has previously been attributed to either competition among potential infectors or depletion of susceptibles in the population. The first explanation requires many infectives for contraction to occur whereas the latter explanation suggests that contraction occurs even when there are few infectives. With a simulation study we show that both competition and depletion cause the mean forward generation time to contract. Our results also reveal that the distribution of the infectious period and the reproduction number have a strong effect on the size and timing of the contraction, as well as on the mean value of the generation time in both forward and backward scheme. These observations relate to the 'serial interval', the time interval between symptom 26 onset of a secondary case and symptom onset of its infector [10]. Many authors have 27 used the serial interval as a synonym for the generation time. However, unlike the 28 generation time, the serial interval can have a negative duration when the clinical 29 March 5, 2019 2/23 .

Finally, we conclude by explaining under which 79 conditions the two hypotheses give rise to the generation interval contraction.",parameters is critical for public health decision-makers in order to take appropriate actions for the global prevention and management of outbreaks and other health emergencies. A key example is given by the prediction models of the reproduction numbers: these rely on the generation time distribution that is usually estimated from contact tracing data collected at a precise calendar time. The forward scheme is used in such a prediction model and the knowledge of its evolution over time is crucial to correctly estimate the parameters of interest. It is therefore important to characterize the causes that lead to the contraction of the mean forward generation time during the course of an outbreak.
Cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike 1 glycoproteins and insights into coronavirus evolution 2 3 4,"A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets 20 with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% 21 identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural 22 reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission 23 to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM 24 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å 25 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically 28 analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and 29 the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The 30 results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most 31 ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion 32 is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV 33 S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results 34 structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV 35 and β-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species 36 transmission of coronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint 39 Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and 40 subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1 . 41 Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, 42 enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2 . The severe acute respiratory 43 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 44 (MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21 st century 1,3 . In the 45 meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic 46 losses 4 . For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 47 (also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery 48 diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms 49 in Guangdong Province of China 5-10 .

Data on genetic 61 evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human SARS-62 CoV and MERS-CoV most likely originate from bats 1 . Palm civets and dromedary 63 camels are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans 1 , 64","However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of SADS-CoV from 68 bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. Recently it was shown 69 that SADS-CoV is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, 70 chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the SADS-CoV for 71 interspecies transmission 17 . 72 The spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host 73 receptor with the S1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the S2 74 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 18, 19 . As a class I viral 75 fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each 76 monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into S1 and 77 S2 subunits 18 . For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit HCoV-OC43 utilizes NTD to recognize glycans 29 ; and one exception is MHV, which 83 utilizes the NTD to bind mouse receptor CEACAM1a 30 . Therefore, the S1 subunit, 84 especially its NTD and CTD, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible 85 for different tropisms of coronaviruses. In comparison, the S2 subunit containing the 86 fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) for membrane fusion are more 87 conserved in both sequence and structure 18, 19 . For the SADS-CoV, receptor analysis 88 indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ACE2, DPP4 89 and APN are essential for the cell entry 7,17 .

The cryo-99 EM structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal 100 structures of the CTD from HKU4 44 , HKU5 45 and HKU9 46 were determined. 101 The spikes of SADS-CoV (1130 amino acid residues) and HKU2 (1128 amino 102 acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and 103 their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, 104 indicating the spikes of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 47 . In this study, we report 105 the cryo-EM structures of the SADS-CoV and HKU2 spike trimers at 2.83 Å and 2.38 106 Å resolution, respectively. The HKU2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat 107 coronavirus. We analyzed the HKU2 and SADS-CoV trimer structures and also 108 compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit "
A method for RNA structure prediction shows evidence for structure in lncRNAs,"To compare the secondary structures of RNA molecules we developed the CROSSalign method. CROSSalign is based on the combination of the Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS) algorithm to predict the RNA secondary structure at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method to align profiles of different lengths. We applied CROSSalign to investigate the structural conservation of long non-coding RNAs such as XIST and HOTAIR as well as ssRNA viruses including HIV. In a pool of sequences with the same secondary structure CROSSalign accurately recognizes repeat A of XIST and domain D2 of HOTAIR and outperforms other methods based on covariance modelling. CROSSalign can be applied to perform pair-wise comparisons and is able to find homologues between thousands of matches identifying the exact regions of similarity between profiles of different lengths. The algorithm is freely available at the webpage Sequence similarity is often considered the key feature to investigate evolutionary conservation of coding transcripts [1]. Yet, knowledge of secondary structure provides important insights into the biological function of RNAs by allowing the study of physical properties, such as for instance molecular interactions [2]. In most cases, information about the RNA folding complements sequence analysis [3] and is useful to understand mechanisms of action: microRNA precursors, for example, are processed by DGCR8 only if properly folded in hairpin loop structures [4]. Similarly, the architecture of ribosomal RNAs evolves in a self-contained way through conservation of stem loops present in ancient species [5,6], indicating distinct requirements for structural elements. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regarded as a mystery in terms of sequence and structural conservation [7]. The vast majority of lncRNAs evolve under little or no selective constraints, undergo almost no purifying selection, show poor expression, and do not have often easily identifiable orthologues [7,8]. Indeed, the average sequence homology of evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs is 20% between human and mouse and drops to 5% between human and fish [7]. Thus, primary structure does not provide relevant information to study lncRNA conservation and secondary structure could be used for better characterization. Similarly to lncRNAs, the transcriptomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses retain their fold even if sequences mutate rapidly [9], which indicates that secondary structure investigation could be key to revealing evolutionary properties. To study the structural conservation of two RNA molecules, we developed the CROSSalign method. CROSSalign, available at our webpages http://service.tartaglialab.com//new_submission/crossalign, is based on the combination of two methods: 1) Computational Recognition Of Secondary Structure (CROSS), which is an algorithm trained on experimental data to predict RNA secondary structure profiles without sequence length restrictions and at singlenucleotide resolution [10]; 2) the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to assess the similarity of two profiles of different lengths [11].

Viral fitness predicts the magnitude and direction of perturbations in the infected host transcriptome,"is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, underexpression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development.",". Analyses of expression data allowed us to characterize differential gene expression upon infection with each TEV genotype, as well as to identify sets of candidate genes whose expressions positively or negatively correlate with the magnitude of TEV fitness. Moreover, differences in expression for representative genes from these two categories were experimentally validated by an alternative method."
The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2,"In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host. Chest radiograph score data are used to estimate the parameters of that model. Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is around 3.79. Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of MERS virus is 8.16 which is higher than SARS-CoV-2. The PRCC method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters and the drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model.","At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, began to threaten the people in China, especially in Hubei province. As of March.3, 2020, 80302 individuals have been confirmed to be infected by this virus in China, including 2946 deaths. To mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government has progressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine in Wuhan and several nearby cities from Jan 23-24, 2020 [18] . The virus has also spread to several other countries, such as the Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy, and USA. Around the world, many new deaths are reported every day."
Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19,"A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world.

Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death, following by sepsis syndrome/MOF, cardiac failure, hemorrhage, and renal failure. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high systemic immune-inflammation index, and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines."
Title: Anesthetic agents affect urodynamic parameters and anesthetic depth at doses necessary to facilitate preclinical testing in felines,"Urodynamic studies, used to understand bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and develop treatments for dysfunctions, are ideally performed with awake subjects. However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [∆HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with αchloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.","Urodynamic studies such as cystometrograms (CMGs) are used to study bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and even develop treatments for bladder dysfunctions. Ideally, the subject should be awake and unanaesthetized during these studies 1 . However anesthesia, which can confound urodynamic outcomes [2] [3] [4] , is often required in many animal models of urodynamic studies, particularly when treatments for bladder dysfunctions are being tested in experimental paradigms that require control over the animal's state."
A speed-fidelity trade-off determines the mutation rate and virulence of an RNA virus 2 3 Running Title: Speed-fidelity trade-off 4 5 6 7,"Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or 28 direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has 29 been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an 30 observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their 31 extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased 32 adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many 33 viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative 34 model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for 35 increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant 36 replication defect and that wild type and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in two 37 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under r-selection led to 38 reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited 39 delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD 50 , consistent with attenuation by slower growth as 40 opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect 41 restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent 42 with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more 43 important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find 44 that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic 45 diversity.","6 (A6176G) to r-selection over serial passage by infecting cells at low multiplicity and harvesting 130 progeny at 4.5 hours (mid-exponential phase of replication). The 3D G64S point mutant reverted to 131 WT within 15 passages in 5 independent lineages ( Fig. 2A) . We only observed partial reversion 132 at passage 15 in a subset of 24-hour control lineages, in which virus populations underwent 133 twice as many cellular infection cycles per passage and experienced reduced r-selection. We 134 next asked whether r-selection would lead to genetic compensation of the fidelity phenotype in 135 3D G64S-3nt , which has all three positions in the codon mutated to minimize reversion. After 50 136 passages of r-selection, we identified fixed and polymorphic single nucleotide variants (SNV) by 137 next generation sequencing of all r-selected and control (24 hour passage) populations of 138 3D G64S and WT (Fig. 2B )."
Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 and possible interruption of local transmission outside Hubei Province in China: a descriptive and modeling study,The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China.

We also estimate changes in key time-to-event distributions and reproduction numbers to assess whether the strict control measures have been able to slow transmission."
Adaptive Estimation for Epidemic Renewal and Phylogenetic Skyline Models,"Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems. Our approach requires some knowledge of the parameter space and exposes the similarities between renewal and skyline models.","Inferring the temporal trends or dynamics of a target population is an important problem in ecology, evolution and systematics. Reliable estimates of the demographic changes underlying empirical data sampled from an animal or human population, for example, can corroborate or refute hypotheses about the historical and ongoing influence of environmental or anthropogenic factors, or inform on the major forces shaping the diversity and structure of that population [40] [13] . In infectious disease epidemiology, where the target population is often the number of infected individuals (infecteds), demographic fluctuations can provide insight into key shifts in the fitness and transmissibility of a pathogen and motivate or validate public health intervention policy [34] [3] ."

"Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication Structure-based design, synthesis, and activity assessment","The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain nearequipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic a-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the aketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.","Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 One of the reasons is that despite the devastating consequences of SARS for the affected patients, the development of an antiviral drug against this virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been rapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004. As a result, we were empty-handed when the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a close relative of SARS-CoV, emerged in 2012. 2 MERS is characterized by severe respiratory disease, quite similar to SARS, but in addition frequently causes renal failure 3 . Although the number of registered MERS cases is low (2494 as of November 30, 2019; www.who.int), the threat MERS-CoV poses to global public health may be even more serious than that presented by SARS-CoV. This is related to the high casefatality rate (about 35%, compared to 10% for SARS), and to the fact that MERS cases are still accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus, whereas the SARS outbreak was essentially contained within 6 months. The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, where 186 cases could be traced back to a single infected traveller returning from the Middle East. 4 SARS-like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in China, [5] [6] [7] [8] from where they may spill over into the human population; this is probably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, which is linked to a seafood and animal market.

2 A systematic review and evaluation of Zika virus forecasting and prediction research during a 3 public health emergency of international concern 4 5 Kobres P,"25 26 27 INTRODUCTION: Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide 28 actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies 29 were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how 30 timely, reproducible and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: 31 To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease 32 outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the 33 recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey 34 literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted or simulated ecological or 35 epidemiological phenomenon related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 36 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, 37 reproducibility, accessibility and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were 38 identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R 0 (basic reproductive number) 39 and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-40 Barré Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%) and intervention impact (4%). Most 41 studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific 42 studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%) and demographic data (37%) were the most 43 common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 44 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent 45 in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty 46 percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 47 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail 48 allowing complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the 49 epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV 50 predictions by a median 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 51 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 52 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in 53 these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for 54 improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response, it is essential to 55 improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics and 56 pandemics.","111 of the publication, (ii) reproducibility of the methods and access to the statistical code and data, 112 and (iii) clarity of the presentation of the prediction results, including uncertainty in prediction 113 estimates.

Novel Immunoglobulin Domain Proteins Provide Insights into Evolution and Pathogenesis Mechanisms of SARS-Related Coronaviruses,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of an emergent severe respiratory disease 20 in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis. By using genomic, sequence, 21 structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha-and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families 22 of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses 23 and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly 24 evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its 25 predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses 26 which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig 27 domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by 28 viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the 29 immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts. 30 31","Nidoviruses are an ancient group of lipid-enveloped viruses with non-segmented RNA genomes, which 35 are known to infect oomycetes and animals, including molluscs, arthropods and vertebrates (1).

Title: Candidate targets for immune responses to 2019-Novel Coronavirus (nCoV): sequence homology-and bioinformatic-based predictions,"Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.","4 map corresponding regions in the 2019-nCoV sequences, and predict likely epitopes. We also used validated bioinformatic tools to predict B and T cell epitopes that are likely to be recognized in humans, and to assess the conservation of these epitopes across different coronavirus species."
Non-uniform refinement: Adaptive regularization improves single particle cryo-EM reconstruction,"Single particle cryo-EM is a powerful method for studying proteins and other biological macromolecules. Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over-and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.","Single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a rapidly advancing technique for determining high resolution 3D structures of proteins and protein complexes. There are several reasons that cryo-EM has become a tool of choice for recent structural biology projects [5] , but key among them is the fact that cryo-EM can be used to study classes of proteins for which other techniques (e.g., X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance) are not effective. These include membrane proteins, proteins larger than ∼30kDa with multiple conformational states, or with flexible or disordered domains. In all of these cases, the proteins are composed of regions with varying structural properties. Membrane proteins in particular are often encapsulated in detergent micelles or lipid nanodiscs, creating a large disordered region of density around the hydrophobic region of the protein. Despite the common occurrence of such spatial variability, most state-of-the-art 3D refinement algorithms are based on the mathematical assumption of uniformity (rigidity) of the particle. This paper formulates a cross-validation regularization framework for single particle cryo-EM refinement, one that explicitly provides for the spatial inhomogeneity generated by various physical phenomena (disorder, motion, occupancy, etc) found in a typical molecular complex. Our proposed framework incorporates general domain knowledge about proteins, without specific knowledge of any particular molecule. Within this framework we derive a novel refinement algorithm, called non-uniform refinement, that accounts for structural variability, while taking care to ensure that the algorithm retains favourable statistical properties for validation and that it does not introduce avenues for over-fitting during 3D reconstruction."
Immunodepletion with Hypoxemia: A Potential High Risk Subtype of Coronavirus Disease 2019,Background The outbreak of COVID-2019 is becoming a global public health,"Results Apart from the clinical features described previously 4 , we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died."
"ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION AT DIFFERENT PREGNANCY STAGES: ANATOMOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TARGET CELLS AND VIRAL PERSISTENCE IN PLACENTAL TISSUES Running title ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION IN HUMAN PLACENTAS List of authors","Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans has been associated with congenital malformations and other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The mechanism(s) of ZIKV intrauterine transmission, the cell types involved, the most vulnerable period of pregnancy for severe outcomes from infection and other physiopathological aspects remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of twenty-four women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these thirdtrimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects. The results we observed in the samples from naturally infected pregnant women may contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the pathophysiology of ZIKV.","positive results by RT-qPCR or immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of placental tissue. Fragments of placental tissue were collected immediately after delivery and were frozen. The presence of the ZIKV genome in the samples was investigated by RT-qPCR, and when appropriate, the presence of antibodies in the serum samples was screened with an ELISA, as described below. An additional fragment of the placenta was kept in buffered formalin for further anatomopathological, morphometric and IHC analyses. The clinical condition of the newborns was evaluated immediately after delivery (no follow-up was performed)."
Title: The impact of persistent bacterial bronchitis on the pulmonary microbiome of,Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children. This 20 study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to 21 assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial 22 bronchitis. 23,"Persistent or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a leading cause of chronic wet cough 45 lasting more than 4 weeks in young children. PBB is particularly common in pre-school 46 children, often developing after a viral lower respiratory infection[1, 2], but may present at 47 any age. As a result, PBB is often either misdiagnosed as asthma or the symptoms are 48 dismissed as being due to recurrent viral infection [1] [2] [3] . 49 50 Standard treatment for PBB is high dose oral antibiotics, the cough typically taking 10 -14 51 days to resolve [4] . Although the aim of therapy is to provide a definitive cure, reoccurrences 52 are frequent and if not treated successfully may lead to bronchiectasis [1] [2] [3] [4] . 53 54 Our understanding of the role of bacteria in chronic respiratory diseases is changing rapidly. 55"
An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors' CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design,The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.,mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within COVID-19 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus. (IPVYQVNNLEEICQLIIQAF). They also suggested that a CTL vaccine for could be designed using epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells identified in these EBOV controllers.

VADR: validation and annotation of virus sequence submissions to GenBank,"Background: GenBank contains over 3 million viral sequences. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. Results: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of ""alerts"" that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank's submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. Conclusion: VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allows researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.","As of September 2019, GenBank [1] contains more than 3 million viral sequences totaling over 4 billion nucleotides in length and including over 180,000 complete genomes for viruses other than influenza. More than 250,000 of these sequences were submitted in 2018. All sequence submissions are validated prior to deposition in GenBank. Automated validation and annotation methods become increasingly important as sequence submission numbers grow. Table 1 shows the number of sequences for the 16 virus species with the most sequences in GenBank. Influenza sequences are the second most abundant and the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), where GenBank is housed, has expended considerable effort to organize flu sequences and streamline the submission of new influenza virus sequences, including a tool to validate and annotate flu submissions called FLAN [2] . The influenza virus sequence submission tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genome/viruses/variation/help/flu-help-center/submitflu-sequences/) is implemented specifically for influenza with many hard-coded features. It has proven [3] (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation) includes specialized components that attempt to normalize annotation of previously submitted sequences for rotaviruses, dengue virus, West Nile virus, ebolaviruses, Zika virus, and MERS coronavirus. The resulting standardized annotation supports virus-specific searches using gene and protein names. However, the Virus Variation Resource does not support submission of new sequences, and its tools are not generalizable, such that creating components for additional virus species is laborious."
Social history and exposure to pathogen signals modulate social status effects on gene regulation in rhesus macaques,"Social experiences are an important predictor of disease susceptibility and survival in humans and other social mammals. Chronic social stress is thought to generate a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-κBdependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history -in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.","The social environment, both in early life and in adulthood, has a profound and often long-lasting impact on health and mortality in humans and other social mammals (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . This relationship is thought to arise in part through changes in gene regulation, which mediate the genomic response to physiological signals of social stress (e.g., glucocorticoids, adrenaline, noradrenaline; (6, 7) ). Gene expression signatures of social status and social adversity have now been reported in multiple studies, encompassing clinical and population-based samples in humans, and studies of both experimental and natural populations in other social animals (6, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (see also (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) for evidence in social insects and other social vertebrates). Because this work has concentrated most extensively on peripheral white blood cells, it provides a direct window into how social experiences are reflected in the regulation of the immune system (26) (27) (28) ."

Identification of viruses with the potential to infect human,"The virus has caused much mortality and morbidity to humans, and still posed a serious threat to the global public health. The virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete. Novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics. However, there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential. This study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. Even for the KNN models built on the contigs as short as 1kb, they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes, suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences. This work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies.","Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and exist in all habitats of the world (Paez-Espino, Eloe-Fadrosh et al. 2016) . They can infect all kinds of organisms ranging from the bacteria to animals, including the human. Humans are constantly exposed to a large diversity of viruses, and over two-thirds of all human pathogens belong to viruses (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007) . The viruses have caused huge mortality and morbidity to the human society in human history, such as the devastating smallpox and Spanish flu. Although much progress have been made in prevention and control of viral infectious disease, recent serial outbreaks caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (Breban, Riou et al. 2013) , avian influenza H7N9 virus (Gao, Cao et al. 2013) , Ebola virus (Maganga, Kapetshi et al. 2014) and Zika virus (Mlakar, Korva et al. 2016) indicate that the viruses still pose a serious threat to the global public health."
Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data,"Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.","Within a globally interconnected and densely populated world, pathogens can spread more easily than they ever did before. As the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses have shown, the risks posed even by these previously known agents remain unpredictable and their expansion hard to control (Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2014) . What is more, it is almost certain that more unknown pathogen species and strains are yet to be discovered, given their constant, extremely fast-paced evolution and unexplored biodiversity, as well as increasing human exposure (Vouga & Greub, 2016; Trappe et al., 2016) . Some of those novel pathogens may cause epidemics (similar to the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks in 2002 and 2012) or even pandemics (e.g. the ""swine flu"" H1N1/09 influenza A strain). Many have more than one host or vector, which makes assessing and predicting the risks even more difficult. For example, Ebola has its natural reservoir most likely in fruit bats (Leendertz et al., 2016) , but causes deadly epidemics in both humans and chimpanzees. As the state-of-the art approach for the open-view detection of pathogens is genome sequencing (Lecuit & Eloit, 2014; Calistri & Palù, 2015) , it is crucial to develop automated pipelines for characterizing the infectious potential of currently unidentifiable sequences."
Risk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside China,"We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","A cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019. The cause of the pneumonia cases was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, recently renamed as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease COVID-19). The first patient showing symptoms was recorded by Chinese authorities on 8 December 2019 [1] . On 9 January 2020, WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus had been isolated from one of the hospitalized persons [2] , and the first death case was reported on the same day. The first case outside China was witnessed on 13 January in Thailand [3] , and in the following days, several other countries also reported 2019-nCoV cases [4] . The first confirmed cases in China, but outside Hubei province, were reported on 19 January. [4] . As of 1 February, there were 14,628 confirmed cases worldwide (out of which 14,451 happened in China) with 305 total deaths [5] ."
Pangolin homology associated with 2019-nCoV,"1 To explore potential intermediate host of a novel coronavirus is vital to rapidly control 2 continuous COVID-19 spread.

From their published results, all virus contigs 1 assembled from 2 lung samples (lung07, lung08) showed not high identities ranging from 2 80.24% to 88.93% with known SARS coronavirus. Hence, we conjectured that dead 3 Malayan pangolin may carry a new coronavirus close to 2019-nCoV. 4 To confirm our assumption, we downloaded raw RNA-seq data (SRA accession 5 number PRJNA573298) of those two lung samples from SRA and conducted consistent 6 quality control and contamination removing as described by Liu's study (7) . We found 1882 7 clean reads from lung08 sample mapped upon 2019-nCoV reference genome (GenBank 8 Accession MN908947)(3) with high genome coverage of 76.02%. We performed de novo 9 assembly of those reads and totally obtained 36 contigs with length ranging from 287bp to 10 2187bp with mean length of 700bp. Blasting against proteins from 2845 coronavirus 11 reference genomes including RaTG13, 2019-nCoVs and other known coronaviruses, we 12 found 22 contigs can be best matched to 2019-nCoVs (70.6%-100% aa identity; average: 13 95.41%) and 12 contigs matched to Bat SARS-like coronavirus (92.7%-100% aa identity; 14 average: 97.48%) (Table S1 ). These results indicate Malayan pangolin indeed carries a 15 novel coronavirus (here named as Pangolin-CoV) close to 2019-nCoV. 16 Using reference-guided scaffolding approach, we created Pangolin-CoV draft 17 genome (19,587 bp) based on the above 34 contigs.

Another SARS-like coronavirus more similar to Pangolin-Cov were Bat 3 SARSr-CoV ZXC21(85.65%) and Bat SARSr-CoV ZC45 (85.01%). These results indicate 4 Pangolin-Cov may be the common origin of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. 5 The viral genome organization of Pangolin-Cov was characterized by sequence 6 alignment against 2019-nCoV (GenBank Accession MN908947) and RaTG13. The 7 Pangolin-Cov genome consists of six major open reading frames (ORFs) common to 8 coronaviruses and other four accessory genes ( Figure 1C and Table S2 ). Further analysis 9 indicates that Pangolin-Cov genes covered 2019-nCoV genes with coverage ranging from 10 45.8% to 100% (average coverage 76.9%).

The network structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics of CRISPR-induced immune diversification,"As a heritable sequence-specific adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas is a powerful force shaping strain diversity in host-virus systems. While the diversity of CRISPR alleles has been explored, the associated structure and dynamics of host-virus interactions has not. We develop theory on the role of CRISPR immunity in mediating the interplay between host-virus interaction structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics in a computational model and three natural systems. We show that the structures of networks describing who infects whom and who is protected from whom are modular and weighted-nested, respectively. The dynamic interplay between these networks influences transitions between dynamical regimes of virus diversification and host control,leading to eventual virus extinction. The three empirical systems exhibit weighted nestedness, a pattern our theory shows is indicative of viral control by hosts. Previously missing from studies of microbial host-pathogen systems, the protection network plays a key role in the coevolutionary dynamics.","antigens that are novel to the host immune system are at a competitive advantage, while those with common ones are at a disadvantage. So far, these studies have only analyzed genetic similarity from the parasite perspective because information on host immunity is typically absent. Hence, how immunity structures host-parasite interactions, for example into modular, or nested topologies, is unknown. Addressing the interplay between the genetic basis of immunity, the structure of the emerging interaction networks and their dynamics, is central to better understand how diversity of hosts and parasites influences infection dynamics and their response to interventions."
Coronavirus S protein-induced fusion is blocked prior to hemifusion by Abl kinase inhibitors,"Enveloped viruses gain entry into host cells by fusing with cellular membranes, a step required for virus replication. Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus","Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses and include those that cause the common cold as well as the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In order to gain entry into host cells, all enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, fuse with cellular membranes."
In trans variant calling reveals enrichment for compound heterozygous variants in genes involved in neuronal development and growth,"Compound heterozygotes occur when different mutations at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of mutations at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 genomes participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 genomes data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 genomes participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5% and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous mutations in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development -PRTG (p=0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p=0.0221% MAF, combined ancestries), and MACF1 (p=0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes.","Using the premise that effective variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with common polymorphisms and haplotypes, linkage and association studies have identified genes involved in the development of traits and pathologies. Upon their identification, the regions flanking associated markers are sequenced to find the linked, penetrant mutation. However, rare variants are often not detectable using LD-based methods."
,"The Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring's rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R 0 .

"Transmission potential of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) onboard the Diamond Princess Cruises Ship, 2020","An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020. Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","While the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) spread rapidly throughout China for several weeks since December 2019, the virus had not taken off outside China in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the Chinese government put in place."
"Title: 2 GI-16 lineage (624/I or Q1), there and Back Again: the 3 history of one of the major threat for poultry farming of our 4 era. 5 6 Short title: 7 Phylodynamic analysis of IBV GI-16 lineage","26 The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its 27 control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its 28 classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now 29 recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical 30 consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common 31 origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two 32 genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population 33 dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A 34 collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences 35 of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected 36 in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results 37 demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist 38 until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the 39 main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely 40 through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated 41 in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains 42 originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to 43 Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy.",166 Parameter estimation were summarized and reported in term of mean and 95% Highest Posterior 167 Density (HPD). Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were constructed and annotated using 168 Treeannotator. SpreaD3 [36] was used to summarize and display phylogeographic results and to 169 calculate the BF of different between-countries migration rates. The transmission rate was 170 considered statistically significant (i.e. non-zero) when the BF was higher than 3 [32].
Gene expression is stronger associated with behaviour than 1 with age and fertility in ant workers 2,"The ecological success of social insects is based on division of labour, not only between queens 20 and workers, but also among workers. Whether a worker tends the brood or forages is strongly 21 influenced by age, fertility and nutritional status, with brood carers being younger, more fecund 22 and corpulent. Here, we experimentally disentangle behaviour from age and fertility 23 in Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers and analyse how these parameters are linked to 24 whole-body gene expression. Our transcriptome analysis reveals four times more genes 25 associated with behaviour than with age and only few fertility-associated genes. Brood carers 26 exhibited an upregulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, whereas foragers invested in 27 metabolism. Additional simulations revealed that the experimental disassociation of co-varying 28 factors reduces transcriptomic noise, potentially explaining discrepancies between 29 transcriptomic studies on worker behaviour in other social insects. Our study highlights the 30 influence of nutritional status on task choice in ant workers.","Division of labour can be found on all levels of biological organization and has arisen 38 independently during several of the major transitions in evolution, for example during the 39 transition from single cell to multicellular organisms or from solitary to social life [1] . The 40 primary driver for the repeated evolution of division of labour is that it allows cells or group 41 members to specialize on few tasks, thus increase in efficiency and allowing for anatomic or 42 physiological adaptations [2] [3] [4] [5] . 43 The mechanistic underpinnings regulating specialization are complex and intensively 44 investigated on different levels of biological organisation. A highly developed example of 45 division of labour is found in the societies of ants, bees, wasps and termites. In these colonies 46 of social insects, reproduction is monopolized by a single or very few individuals, the queens 47 (and kings in termites), whereas the majority of the colony membersthe workers -remain 48 functionally sterile. All other colony chores are distributed among the workers, which specialize 49 on specific tasks such as brood care, nest defence and foraging [3] . 50 Whether a worker stays inside the nest and cares for the brood or leaves the nest and 51 forages is strongly influenced by age and physiology with brood carers being younger [3], more 52 corpulent [6-14] and more fertile [15, 16] than foragers. Due to high external mortality outside 53 the nest [17], this age-and physiology-based non-reproductive division of labour is beneficial, 54 because it ensures that young workers with longest residual life span, the largest amount of 55 stored resources and the highest reproductive potential stay inside the safety of the nest. 56 Although age and physiology are important regulators of worker task choice in many 57 social insects, few common mechanisms linking age and physiology to behaviour have been 58 found. For example, the switch from brood care to foraging is at least partly regulated by an 59 interaction between age and stable lipid loss [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 18, 19] . Information on the nutritional status 60 are transported to and in the brain via Target of rapamycin (TOR) and Insulin/Insulin-like 61 signalling (IIS) pathways [12, [20] [21] [22] [23] .

Zika virus outbreak in the Americas: Is Aedes albopictus an overlooked culprit?,"Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. In the present study, we employed multiple codon usage analysis indices to determine genotype specific codon usage patterns of Zika virus (ZIKV) strains from the current outbreak and those reported previously. Several genotype specific and common codon usage traits were noted in ZIKV coding sequences, indicative of independent evolutionary origins from a common ancestor.","Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Like the closely related Dengue virus (DENV), ZIKA is also mosquito borne, spread by multiple Aedes species. Since its discovery in 1947, previous reports of ZIKV detection have been largely sporadic until the recent and ongoing outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas (Campos et al., 2015) , with a few notable exceptions, including the ZIKV outbreaks in the Yap Islands (2007) (Duffy et al., 2009 ) and French Polynesia (2013 (Cao-Lormeau and Musso, 2014) . The close similarity between the clinical manifestations of ZIKV and those of DENV and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) remains a potential obstacle to the efficient surveillance and management of ZIKV."
When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: a SEIR modeling analysis,"Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R 0 =1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)，TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.","Wuhan is the largest city in central China with a total population of more than 11 million [1] .

The translational landscape of Zika virus during infection of mammalian and 1 insect cells 2 3,"14 Zika virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, which has 15 recently undergone a rapid expansion among humans in the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report 16 a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of 17 mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses 18 such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off 19 during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative 20 mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that 21 high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream 22 open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for 23 the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two 24 uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5' end 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/112904 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3 Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (gRNA) of 51 ~11 kb, which contains a long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5′ and 3′ ""untranslated"" 52 regions (UTRs) of approximately 100 and 400 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 1A) . The ORF 53 encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved by host and viral proteases to yield three structural proteins 54 located in the N-terminal region (capsid -C, precursor/membrane -Pr/M, and envelope -E) and 55 seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (6). Consequently, 56 these proteins are expected to be produced in equimolar amounts during infection, although the 57 former set are presumed to be required in higher quantities for the production of progeny virus 58 particles (7). Indeed, in the flavivirus lineage that includes West Nile virus, efficient ribosomal 59 frameshifting in the NS2A region diverts up to 50% of translating ribosomes into an overlapping 60 ORF, resulting in a substantial reduction in synthesis of the 3′-encoded replicative proteins relative 61 to the 5′-encoded structural proteins (8). A similar phenomenon is also seen in a group of insect-62 specific flaviviruses (9). 63 64"

"Estimating the Asymptomatic Proportion of 2019 Novel Coronavirus onboard the Princess Cruises Ship, 2020","The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%-20.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.","The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 continue to be investigated as the virus continues its march through the human population [2] [3] . While reliable estimates of the reproduction number and the death risk associated with COVID-19 are crucially needed to guide public health policy, another key epidemiological parameter that could inform the intensity and range of social distancing strategies to combat COVID-19 is the asymptomatic proportion, which is broadly defined as the proportion of asymptomatic infections among all the infections of the disease. Indeed, the asymptomatic proportion is a useful quantity to gauge the true burden of the disease and better interpret estimates of the transmission potential. This proportion varies widely across infectious diseases, ranging from 8% for measles and 32% for norovirus up to 90-95% for polio [4] [5] [6] . Most importantly, it is well established that asymptomatic individuals are frequently able to transmit the virus to others [7] [8] ."

Caution: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients at admission are changing,"With the emergence of 4 rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 has entered a new period.","Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of large-scale pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. 1-2 RT-PCR analyses and electron microscope observations detected a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV). 3 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been confirmed to have obvious person-to-person transmission among close contacts. [4] [5] As of February 25, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases and a total of 2700 deaths have been identified globally. 6 As the epidemic spreads to many countries, COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health. In the early stage of the epidemic, the most common clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the onset of illness manifested as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, with or without sputum production and diarrhea. 7 Therefore, detecting and confirming infected cases in a timely manner and applying scientific treatment as soon as possible is extremely essential to reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Since the emergence of 3 th and even 4 rd -generation transmission 4 and signs of asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19, 8 the prevention and control of COVID-19 has entered a new period. Consequently, it is urgent to carefully observe the changes in patients' initial symptoms. As the designated hospital for patients with severe infection, we have been receiving COVID-19 patients in the newly opened unit since January 16. After the government announced a state of emergency and closed access to Wuhan city on January 23, the number of suspected patients who came to our unit increased rapidly. As of January 29, we received 89 patients confirmed with COVID-19. Surprisingly, during the consultation, we found that the clinical characteristics of patients admitted after January 23 began to differ from those of patients admitted before, which brings new challenges for the diagnosis of suspected patients. To prevent and control the epidemic scientifically, this study aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the perspective of clinical doctors and to compare the initial clinical features between patients infected in different periods."

Replication of MERS and SARS coronaviruses in bat cells offers insights to their 1 ancestral origins 2 3,"26 Previous findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-27 related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein to utilize 28 MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, suggest a bat ancestral origin of 29 MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including 30 Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-31 BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested 32 their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 33 Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible 34 to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed 35 different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines 36 respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot 37 replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to 38 those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 39 residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 40 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA 41 expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 42 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus 43 DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular 44 factors in determining viral replication.

Understanding the present status and forecasting of COVID-19 in Wuhan,The present status of COVID-19 is analyzed and the end of the disease is forecasted. The,"Pneumonia originated in Wuhan, which is referred as COVID-19 in the following, is now a great fear in the world. The fear of people is caused by no existence of forecasting of the final scale of the disaster and the end of the disease. This paper reports forecasting of the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result of the data analysis, it was found that the peak of the number of newly infected people differed by region, and the peak was February 2 in China outside Hubei Province. The decay constant was about 8 days. On February 11, the number of newly infected people reduced to less than half of the peak value. In Wuhan city, the source of the virus, the peak was reached, but the fluctuation of the number of new infections is large."
Effectiveness of airport screening at detecting travellers infected with 2019-nCoV,Note: this report is a pre-print and has not yet been peer-reviewed.,"We simulated 100 infected air travellers who are still infected with 2019-nCoV on arrival at their destination and hence would pose a risk for seeding transmission in a new region. The duration of travel is the flight time plus a small amount of additional travel time for airport procedures. We assumed that most individuals will develop symptoms, including fever, at the end of their incubation period and progress to more severe symptoms after a few days, resulting in hospitalisation and isolation. Individuals may also exhibit an asymptomatic (subclinical) infection where they do not exhibit symptoms that would be detected by thermal scanning or cause them to seek medical care, although these individuals may be infectious. Travellers may exhibit severe symptoms during their travel; upon arrival they are hospitalised without undergoing entry screening. We then estimated the proportion of travellers who would be detected by exit and entry screening, develop severe symptoms during travel, or go undetected, under varying assumptions of:"
DNA segment of African Swine Fever Virus 1 first detected in hard ticks from sheep and bovine,"In this study, we aimed to detect viruses in hard ticks using the small RNA sequencing based method. 24 A 235-bp DNA segment was detected in Dermacentor nuttalli (hard ticks) and D. silvarum (hard ticks) from 25 sheep and bovine, respectively. The detected 235-bp segment had an identity of 99% to a 235-bp DNA 26 segment of African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) and contained three single nucleotide mutations (C38T, 27 C76T and A108C). C38T, resulting in an single amino acid mutation G66D, suggests the existence of a new 28 ASFV strain, which is different from all reported ASFV strains in NCBI GenBank database. These results 29 also suggest that ASFV could have a wide range of hosts or vectors, beyond the well known Suidae family 30 and soft ticks. Our findings pave the way toward further studies of ASFV transmission and development of 31 prevention and control measures.","In this study, we aimed to detect viruses in hard ticks using the small RNA sequencing based method. 24 A 235-bp DNA segment was detected in Dermacentor nuttalli (hard ticks) and D. silvarum (hard ticks) from 25 sheep and bovine, respectively.

Rapid Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Virus RNA Using Colorimetric LAMP,"The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.","The emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) has infected tens of thousands of people in China, with cases in at least 28 other countries and prompting a worldwide response. The diagnostics industry has responded rapidly, with Emergency Use Authorization granted for PCR-based tests from the US CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), Seegene in Korea and BGI in China (https://www.bgi.com/global/company/news/bgi-develops-realtime-dna-based-kit-for-detecting-the-2019-novel-coronavirus/) among many other providers releasing reagents, primers and probes, and other materials to support this urgent public health need. The current diagnostic standard combines clinical symptoms and molecular method, and as many of the symptoms resembles those of common cold and influenza, an accurate molecular result is critical for final diagnosis. These molecular methods include metagenomics sequencing mNGS (1) and RT-qPCR(2), both are excellent and sensitive techniques, but approaches not without limitations. mNGS is restricted by throughput, turnover time, formidable high cost and requirement for high technical expertise. As with most molecular diagnostics, RT-qPCR is the most widely used method, but it requires expensive laboratory instruments and is difficult to utilize outside of well-equipped facilities. In combination to the different patient samples containing variable number of virus, a high proportion of patients were diagnosed as false negatives (3, 4) ."
Cotranslational Folding Stimulates Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in the Alphavirus Structural Polyprotein,"Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding and/ or binding events may also stimulate PRF.","Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to exploit the host machinery in order to increase the coding capacity of their highly constrained genomes. There are at least 27 viral genera that utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) in order to produce multiple proteins from a single transcript (https://viralzone.expasy.org/860). PRF is genetically encoded, and minimally requires a portion of the transcript that contains a repetitive ""slippery"" heptanucleotide sequence (slip-site) followed by a region that forms stimulatory RNA secondary structures (an ensemble of stem loops and/ or pseudoknots). 1, 2 A collision between the translating ribosome and the stimulatory secondary structure increases the kinetic barrier to translocation, which causes the ribosome to dwell on the slip-site. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] During this pause, the t-RNA that is annealed within the ribosomal P-site (and most often also the t-RNA in the A-site) 8 begin to sample alternative base pairing interactions that shift the reading frame of the ribosme. 9 Based on these mechanistic considerations, PRF is typically believed to be mediated at the level of RNA structure. Nevertheless, recent reports have also found that the efficiency of -1PRF can be tuned by a variety of regulatory proteins and/ or miRNA. [10] [11] [12] -1PRF is utilized to temporally and stoichiometrically regulate protein production during viral replication and assembly. For instance, the alphavirus structural proteins are most often produced from a single polyprotein that is cleaved into the capsid (CP), E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins ( Figure   1A ). 13 The E2 and E1 proteins are membrane glycoproteins that heterodimerize early in the assembly pathway. These dimeric units then form trimeric spike complexes, traffic to the plasma membrane, and initiate viral budding. 14-16 -1PRF during the translation of the 6K protein gives rise to a secondary form of the polyprotein containing the TransFrame (TF) protein, 13 ,17 a known .

Because -1PRF precludes the translation of E1, the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting (1-48% in alphaviruses) 22 influences the stoichiometric ratio of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins and the net accumulation of spike complexes. Current evidence suggests -1PRF is stimulated by a canonical poly-U slip site and a downstream RNA hairpin. 23 However, an effort to map the stimulatory RNA structures within alphavirus polyproteins revealed that deletions within the predicted hairpin region are capable of reducing the efficiency of -1PRF, but appear to be insufficient to knock out frameshifting completely. 22 This observation suggests there may be multiple regulatory mechanisms that mediate -1PRF within the alphavirus structural polyprotein."
Dissecting genetic and sex-specific host heterogeneity in pathogen transmission 1 potential 2 3 4,"Heterogeneity in disease transmission is widespread and, when not accounted for, can 12 produce unpredictable outbreaks of infectious disease. Despite this, precisely how 13 different sources of variation in host traits drive heterogeneity in disease transmission is 14 poorly understood. Here we dissected the sources of variation in pathogen transmission 15","Individual host heterogeneity in disease spread is commonly observed across a wide 35 range of infectious diseases (Woolhouse et al., 1997 with DCV, flies were pricked in the pleural suture with a 0.15mm diameter pin, bent 146 at 90º ~0.5mm from the tip, dipped in DCV. 147 at death was measured for n=17-20, three treatment groups consisted of n=7-15 flies 155 (Table S1) . to tubes for 24 hours, immediately following 1 or 2 days after systemic infection.

Programmable low-cost DNA-based platform for viral RNA detection,"Viral detection is critical for controlling disease spread and progression. Recent emerging threats including the Zika and Ebola virus outbreaks highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. In low-resource areas, a key obstacle is quick and accurate detection of viruses near the point of care. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal preamplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable (with ~24-hour development time) to detect other viruses. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.","Newly emerging or re-emerging viruses pose significant challenges to health care systems, particularly as globalization has contributed to the rampant spread of these viruses. 1 RNA viruses are frequently the cause of sweeping outbreaks due to the naturally high mutation rates during replication that lead to rapid viral evolution. 2, 3 Examples of this include the annual influenza outbreak, as well as more recent threats from Ebola virus, henipavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, and Zika virus (ZIKV). Technological advancements in structural biology and genomics have been important for identifying viruses, and for advancing fundamental viral research and antiviral therapeutics. 4 However, clinical methods for robust, low-cost and rapid detection of viral infections optimized for use in low-resource areas and point-of-care (POC) mode remain a major challenge for emergent viruses."
"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus. Severe infection by 2019-nCoV could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 2% of infected individuals 1 . Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of 2019-nCoV can bind the surface receptors of sensitive cells, and mediate the virus to enter into target cells. Recently, Xu et.al. modeled the spike protein and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this 2019-nCoV 2 . Zhou et. al. showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells 3","Previous studies have investigated the RNA expression of ACE2 in 72 human tissues 4 . They found ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestines. They also found ACE2 expression in the basal layer of the non-keratinizing squamous epithelium in nasal and oral mucosa and the nasopharynx. Yu Zhao et al. analyzed the single-cell RNA-Seq data of the lung tissues from eight donors and found that ACE2 mainly expressed in the type II alveolar cells (AT2) 5 . They found that ACE2 shows significantly high expression in AT2 of an Asian donor. However, the abundance of ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory tract needs further identification."
Tracking progress towards malaria elimination in China: estimates of 1 reproduction numbers and their spatiotemporal variation 2 3,"China reported zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-9 temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and 10 imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is 11 particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using 12 a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, 13","In 2016 the World Health Organisation listed 21 countries for whom it would be realistic to achieve 22 elimination of malaria by 2020, defined as zero indigenous cases over three consecutive years 1 . The 23 largest of these is the People's Republic of China (thereafter called China). In 2017 China reported no 24 indigenous malaria cases for the first time since malaria became a notifiable disease in 1956 2, 3 . The 25 country has experienced a major decline in the burden of malaria, from an annual incidence of 24 26 million cases (2961 cases per 100,000) in 1970 4 . This reduction has been attributed to a combination 27 of socioeconomic improvements and the scale-up of interventions to control malaria 5 . In 2010, China 28 set out an ambitious plan for the national elimination of malaria by 2020 (the National Malaria 29 Elimination Programme, NMEP). Elements of the plan included improved surveillance, timely 30 response, more effective and sensitive risk assessment tools and improved diagnostics 6 . A key policy 31 change implemented in 2010 as part of the NMEP was the introduction of the 1-3-7 system: aiming 32 for case reporting in one day, which is then investigated within three days, with a focused 33 investigation and action taken in under seven days 7 . 34"
Modification of primary amines to higher order amines reduces in vivo hematological and immunotoxicity of cationic nanocarriers through TLR4 and complement pathways,"For decades, cationic polymer nanoparticles have been investigated for nucleic acid delivery. Despite promising in vitro transfection results, most formulations have failed to translate into the clinic due to significant in vivo toxicity -especially when delivered intravenously. To address this significant problem, we investigated the detailed mechanisms that govern the complex in vivo systemic toxicity response to common polymeric nanoparticles.","A wide variety of nanoparticles have been developed over the past decades to facilitate the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies, such as plasmid DNA, oligonucleotides, shortinterfering RNAs (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA). [1, 2] To form nanoparticles, anionic nucleic acids are often complexed with cationic polymers or cationic lipids -a process that results in nanoparticles with efficient nucleic acid loading and favorable physical characteristics for intracellular delivery of the cargo in vitro. [3] , [4] Despite several desirable attributes, cationic nanoparticles induce significant in vivo toxicity, especially when delivered systemically, which has prevented their clinical translation even after decades of research. For lipid-based particles, toxicity profiles have been improved by using ionizable and neutral lipids with other excipients. In fact, most current clinical trials for systemic delivery using nanoparticles use lipid-based particles. [5] [6] [7] Meanwhile, a whole class of materials (cationic polymers), despite demonstrating promising in vitro efficacy results for decades, has not advanced into the clinic. In some cases nanoparticles consisting of modified cyclodextrin or protamine were evaluated in Phase I clinical trials, but further studies were not pursued. [8, 9] An ideal nucleic acid delivery agent must ensure a balance between low toxicity and high therapeutic efficacy in vivo -two attributes that have been difficult to achieve simultaneously using cationic polymer nanoparticles. [10] Chemists and material scientists have empirically optimized physicochemical properties (e.g. size, surface functional groups, charge) to improve nanoparticle safety and transfection efficiency [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] These studies identified formulations with lower in vitro toxicity, and in some cases, the potential for in vivo efficacy in animal models, but detailed studies on the relationship between nanoparticle design and mechanisms of in vivo systemic toxicity have been scarce or very limited in scope. [18] A widely studied modification to reduce systemic toxicity of nanoparticles is the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the formulations. A major drawback of PEG-modified formulations, however, is that anti-PEG antibodies can be generated, which activate the complement cascade and further decrease therapeutic efficacy. [19] [20] [21] [22] This shortcoming of PEG, which could not be predicted in vitro, highlight the importance of studies that investigate the detailed in vivo mechanisms by which nanoparticles induce systemic toxicity."
Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on the early global spread of COVID-19,"Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.","results indicate multiple countries (many with low IDVI, hence highly vulnerable) might see (or already have seen) case emergence in the month of February."
The IFN response in bat cells consists of canonical and non-canonical ISGs with unique temporal expression kinetics,"Bats are reservoirs for a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, yet they remain relatively asymptomatic during infection. Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFNα in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats.","Bats are recognized as important viral reservoirs due to their ability to harbor a number of highly pathogenic viruses, including Nipah virus (NiV) (1), Hendra virus (HeV) (2) , Marburg virus (3), SARS coronavirus (4) , and Ebolavirus (5) without suffering from overt disease symptoms (6) (7) (8) (9) . A recent study identified bats as hosts for a greater proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders tested, with the highest viral richness found in Flavi-, Bunya-and Rhabdoviruses (10) . While the mechanisms underlying disease resistance are not known, it has been speculated that bats possess unique immune components that confer innate antiviral protection (9, 11) . In vertebrates, one of the first lines of defense against viral pathogens is the interferon (IFN) response. Upon viral infection, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) sense viral components and initiate a signaling cascade that results in the secretion of IFNs. These IFNs bind their cognate receptors to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcriptional induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have antiviral activity (12) ."
Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of contention measures in Spain: a data-driven approach,"Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China -where the outbreak started -seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases.","The first report by the Chinese authorities of the COVID-19 outbreak appeared in December 31st, 2019. Ever since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) and national public health authorities have been tracing and reporting on the evolution of the outbreak. As initially feared, and despite contention measures adopted in China, with a big city like Wuhan being quarantined for weeks, the disease spread beyond mainland China. As of February 29th, 2020, there are 85,403 cases worldwide, of which 79,394 correspond to China [1] . Additionally, 53 countries, including Spain, have reported at least one case of COVID-19. Two months into the outbreak, much is still unknown about the natural history of the disease and the pathogen. Important from the modeling perspective, for instance, it has been claimed that a large number of cases might have gone undetected by routinely screening passengers, due to the special characteristics of this disease [2] . Admmitedly, several studies predict that only between 10% and 20% of the cases have been detected and reported [3] [4] [5] [6] ."
Individual and temporal variation in pathogen load predicts long- 1 term impacts of an emerging infectious disease,"Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus 27 on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting 28 long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We 29 used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and 30 transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian 31 devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian 32 Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and 33 demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, 34 enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population 35 declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of 36 matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour 37 disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the 38 remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with 39 long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen 40 coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial 41 management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-42 term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that 43 immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of 44","preferred strategy may be to avoid interference to allow a new long-term endemic disease 72 state or pathogen extinction to be reached as quickly as possible (Gandon et al. 2013) . 73 Longer-term evolutionary processes can operate to ultimately reduce the impact of the 74 .

Structure of the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1 bound to a ubiquitinylated nucleosome,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins represent a diverse family of proteins that share ATPase domains that are adapted to regulate protein-DNA interactions. Here we present structures of the yeast Chd1 protein engaged with nucleosomes in the presence of the transition state mimic ADP-beryllium fluoride. The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA. This indicates how changes to nucleosome structure can alter the way in which histone epitopes are presented.","The extended family of ATPases related to the yeast Snf2 protein act to alter DNA protein interactions (Flaus et al., 2006; Narlikar et al., 2013) . They act on a diverse range of substrates. For example, while the Mot1 protein acts on complexes between the TATA box binding protein BP and DNA (Wollmann et al., 2011) , the Snf2 protein carries out ATP dependent nucleosome disruption (Cote et al., 1994) . At the heart of all these proteins are paired domains capable of rearranging during the ATP hydrolysis cycle to create a ratchet like motion along DNA in single base increments (Clapier et al., 2017; Gu & Rice, 2010; Velankar et al., 1999) ."

Development and Evaluation of A CRISPR-based Diagnostic For 2019-novel Coronavirus,"The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third 36 zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate 37 diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. 38 Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR 39 (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics for 2019-nCoV.","Since the beginning of 2020, a surging number of pneumonia caused by infections of a novel 56 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been identified in China, especially Wuhan, a metropolitan 57 city with a population of over 10 million.

Quantifying the Risk and Cost of Active Monitoring for Infectious Diseases,"During outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV) and bioterror threats (e.g., smallpox), actively monitoring potentially infected individuals aims to limit disease transmission and morbidity.","The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in west Africa was the largest outbreak of a highly virulent acute infection in modern times, leading the global health community to reassess the ability of highly pathogenic acute infections to spread widely in today's interconnected world. To improve rapid identification and evaluation of individuals infected with Ebola, on October 27, 2014, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended active monitoring of individuals potentially exposed to Ebola virus."
,Cases from the ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) exported from mainland China can lead to self-sustained outbreaks in other populations.,Internationally imported cases are currently being reported in several different locations. Early detection of imported cases is critical for containment of the virus. Based on air travel volume estimates from Wuhan to international destinations and using a generalized linear regression model we identify locations which may potentially have undetected internationally imported cases.
Title: Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections Correspondence to,1 Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 2 from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. 3,The epidemic of novel coronavirus infections that began in 12
Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19),"The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","By early February 2020, it was evident that the incidence of novel coronavirus infections (COVID-19) was exponential [1] . Accelerated by human migration, exported cases have been reported in various regions of the world, including Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania [2] . To minimize the rapid growth of cases via human-to-human transmission [3] [4] [5] , the government of China suspended all modes of transportation to and from Wuhan on 23 January 2020-including vehicles, trains, and flights-expecting that the intervention would prevent further spread of the disease [6] . As of 12 February 2020, two additional cities outside of Hubei Province-Wenzhou (Zhejiang Province) and Shenzhen (Guangdong Province)-have been placed on complete lockdown (i.e. no cross-border movement to and from the closed city) to prevent further spatial spread of COVID-19. To our knowledge, such drastic movement restrictions are a historical first."
Stochastic challenges to interrupting helminth transmission,"Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty-natural, or otherwise -to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as 'breakpoints' in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a 'stochastic breakpoint' where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the 'interruption of transmission' independent of the 'breakpoint' concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the 'fade-out' or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described. : medRxiv preprint","Helminthiases are a class of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect many hundreds of millions of humans and animals worldwide. One group of worms, the soiltransmitted helminths (STH) are especially prevalent are transmitted through the ingestion of eggs (for Ascaris lumbricoides or Trichuris trichuria) or larvae (in the case of the hookworms: Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). They are estimated to affect 1.45 billion people at present [1, 2] ."
Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19,"Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission.",quarantined and sections of the Baodi District where the store is located were sealed and put under security patrol.
A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing,"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England.","An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020, 9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19 different countries (1) ."
Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China,"Background. The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented.","Here, we consider the development of epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV (see e.g., [1] [2] [3] ). Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the number of victims V of this virus only in this area. The first estimations of V exponential growth, typical for the initial stages of every epidemic (see e.g., [4] ) have been done in [3] . For long time predictions, more complicated mathematical models are necessary. For example, a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was used in [2] . Nevertheless, the complicated models need more efforts for unknown parameters identification. This procedure may be especially difficult, if reliable data are limited."
Concerted 2-5A-Mediated mRNA Decay and Transcription Reprogram Protein Synthesis in dsRNA Response,"RNA degradation by RNase L during 2-5A-mediated decay (2-5AMD) is a conserved mammalian stress response to viral and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). 2-5AMD onsets rapidly and facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to production of interferons (IFNs). To understand the mechanism of this protein synthesis reprogramming, we examined 2-5AMD in human cells. 2-5AMD triggers polysome collapse characteristic of a translation initiation defect, but translation initiation complexes and ribosomes purified from the translation-arrested cells remain functional. Using spike-in RNA-seq we found that basal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) rapidly decay, while mRNAs encoding IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes evade 2-5AMD and accumulate. The IFN evasion results from the combined effect of better mRNA stability and positive feedback amplification in the IFN response. Therefore, 2-5AMD and transcription act in concert to revamp the cellular mRNA composition. The resulting preferential accumulation of innate immune mRNAs establishes ""prioritized"" synthesis of defense proteins.","The innate immune system is activated without the delay needed for antibody production and provides an immediate defense barrier against infections and out-ofcontrol host cells posing danger. In higher vertebrates, the innate immune system relies on interferon (IFN) signaling coupled with a vertebrae-specific pathway of regulated RNA degradation, 2-5A-mediated decay (2-5AMD) (Chakrabarti et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2014b; Rath et al., 2015) . 2-5AMD is activated in the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a pathogen-associated and damageassociated molecular pattern that signals the presence of viruses (Li et al., 2016) and pathologic derepression of endogenous repeat elements of the host (Chiappinelli et al., 2015; Leonova et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017) ."
Mechanistic insights into Zika virus NS3 helicase inhibition by Epigallocatechin-3-gallate,"Since 2007, repeated outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) has affected millions of people worldwide and created global health concern with major complications like microcephaly and Guillain Barre's syndrome. Generally, ZIKV transmits through mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) like other flaviviruses, but reports show blood transfusion and sexual mode of ZIKV transmission which further makes the situation alarming. Till date, there is not a single Zika specific licensed drug or vaccine present in the market. However, in recent months, several antiviral molecules have been screened against viral and host proteins.","Since 2007, repeated outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) has affected millions of people worldwide and created global health concern with major complications like microcephaly and Guillain Barre's syndrome.

Novel Function of Bluetongue Virus NS3 Protein in Regulation of the MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway 2 3,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus transmitted by blood-feeding midges to a wide 27 range of wild and domestic ruminants. In this report, we showed that BTV, through its virulence 28 non-structural protein NS3 (BTV-NS3), is able to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. In 29 response to growth factors, the MAPK/ERK pathway activates cell survival, differentiation, 30 proliferation and protein translation but can also lead to the production of several inflammatory 31 cytokines. By combining immunoprecipitation of BTV-NS3 and mass spectrometry analysis 32 from both BTV-infected and NS3-transfected cells, we identified the serine/threonine-protein 33 kinase B-Raf (BRAF), a crucial player of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as a new cellular interactor 34 of BTV-NS3. BRAF silencing led to a significant decrease of the MAPK/ERK activation by 35 BTV supporting a model where BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF to activate this signaling 36 cascade. Furthermore, the intrinsic ability of BTV-NS3 to bind BRAF and activate the 37 MAPK/ERK pathway is conserved throughout multiple serotypes/strains but appears to be 38 specific to BTV compared to other members of Orbivirus genus. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK 39 pathway with U0126 reduced viral titers, suggesting that BTV manipulates this pathway for its 40 own replication. Therefore, the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by BTV-NS3 could 41 benefit to BTV replication by promoting its own viral protein synthesis but could also explain 42 the deleterious inflammation associated with tissue damages as already observed in severe cases 43 of BT disease. Altogether, our data provide molecular mechanisms to explain the role of BTV-44 NS3 as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis. 45 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Title: Incorporating Human Movement Data to Improve Epidemiological Estimates for 2019-nCoV,"Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geostratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.",". A geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework. The latent infection ratio was estimated from the number of people traveling from Wuhan to other destinations of mainland China. before the lockdown, and the confirmed 2019-nCoV case reporting data in these destinations.

The incubation period of 2019-nCoV from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application,"A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.4, 6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.","In December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The initial cluster was epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, though many of the initial 41 cases were later reported to have no known exposure to the market [1] . A novel strain of coronavirus belonging to the same family of viruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the common cold was subsequently isolated from lower respiratory tract samples of four patients on 7 January 2020 [2] .

As of February 17, 2020, a total of 72436 COVID-19 cases were officially confirmed in mainland China, 3 and 42752 of which come from Wuhan. 4 The rapidly increasing number of cases in Wuhan promotes people to concern whether there are infected cases not identified or quarantined in time."
The role of post-Golgi transport pathways and sorting motifs in the plasmodesmal targeting of the movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV),"Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system that is targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is targeted to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Despite a number of functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP has been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Introducing glycine substitutions in these motifs results in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at PD. Taken together, these data suggest that both Y and LL motifs are indispensable for targeting of OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection, but show differences in functionality. This study provides new insights into the role of sorting motifs in intracellular targeting of MPs and vesicle trafficking pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.","Delivery of cargo proteins between distinct locations in the endomembrane system depends on vesicle trafficking. The plant endomembrane system has unique players controlling trafficking pathways to modulate plant-specific cellular functions and environmental responses (reviewed by Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012) . The trans-Golgi network (TGN) acts as an early endosome (EE) and a major sorting platform where secretory, endocytic, and vacuolar pathways merge (Viotti et al., 2010) . Endocytosed cargoes are received by the TGN and these cargoes are either returned to the plasma membrane or sent to multivesicular bodies (MVBs)/prevacuolar compartments (PVCs), which in plant cells serve as late endosomes (LEs), for vacuolar degradation (reviewed by Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012; Cui et al., 2016) ."

Messenger RNAs transcribed from yeast linear cytoplasmic plasmids possess unconventional 5' and 3' UTRs and suggest a novel mechanism of translation,"Linear plasmids with almost identical compact genetic organization have been found in the cytoplasm of yeast species from nine genera. We employed pGKL1,2 plasmids from Kluyveromyces lactis as a model to investigate the previously unstudied transcriptome of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids. We performed 5' and 3' RACE analysis of all the pGKL1,2 mRNAs and found them not 3' polyadenylated and containing mostly uncapped 5' poly(A) leaders that are not complementary to the plasmid DNA. The degree of 5' capping and/or 5' polyadenylation is specific to each gene and is controlled by the corresponding promoter regions. We refined the description of the pGKL1,2 promoters and found new alternative promoters of several genes. We also provide evidence that K2ORF3 encodes an mRNA cap guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase and that 5' capped pGKL1,2 transcripts contain N 7 -methylated caps. Translation of pGKL1,2 transcripts is enhanced in lsm1Δ and pab1Δ strains and is independent of eIF4E and Pab1 translation factors. We suggested a model of a primitive regulation of pGKL1,2 plasmids gene expression where degree of 5' mRNA capping, degree of 5' non-template polyadenylation and presence of negative regulators as PAB1 and Lsm1 play an important role. Our data also suggest a close relationship between linear plasmids and poxviruses. doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 synthesized in a template-independent manner. We show that plasmid promoters directly determine the formation of the mRNA 5' end leaders and their capping, pointing to a possible role of the plasmid RNA polymerase in this unusual phenomenon. We also provide the first evidence that MTase is an essential part of the K2Orf3p enzyme and that capped pGKL mRNAs are methylated at the N 7 position of the terminal guanosine moiety. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that translation of plasmid-specific mRNAs is independent of major cellular cap-binding proteins, translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the Pab1 and Lsm1 proteins that were speculated to be possible translational enhancers and/or stabilizers of cellular and viral mRNAs bearing 5' poly(A) stretches (38,39). Our results thus suggest the existence of a novel translation initiation mechanism.","Linear plasmids have been found in the cytoplasm of yeast species from nine genera, including Kluyveromyces, Debaryomyces, Saccharomyces, Saccharomycopsis, Wingea, and"
The guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 participates in rotavirus,"Cellular and viral factors participate in the replication cycle of rotavirus.

The innermost layer is composed of the core-shell proteinVP2 that encloses 62 the replication intermediates, composed of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and 63 the guanylyl-methyl transferase, VP3. The intermediate layer is formed by VP6 that 64 surrounds the VP2 layer to form double-layered particles (DLPs). Finally, the addition of the 65 glycoprotein VP7 and the spike protein VP4 onto the DLPs forms the infectious triple-layered 66 particles (TLPs) (1, 2). 67 The replication of rotavirus occurs in cytoplasmic non-membranous electron-dense 68 inclusions termed viroplasms composed of NSP2, NSP5, VP1, VP2, VP6 and host 69 components (1, 3).

This 24 reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly since in the presence of either 25 BFA or GCA the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly 26 prevented and only doubled layered-particles were detected. We report that the catalytic 27 activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer 28 capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the 29 synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and 30 block the trimerization of the virus surface VP7, a step required for its incorporation into 31 virus particles. Although a post-translational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) 32 could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in 33 this process, since knocking-down its expression reduces VP7 trimerizarion.

Evidence of recombination in coronaviruses implicating pangolin origins of nCoV- 2019,"A novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) was the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity.

Data available to date has led to the hypothesis that the outbreak strain originated from bats. The nCoV-2019 has been reported to share 96% sequence identity to the RaTG13 genome, a coronavirus isolated from an intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) 2 . RaTG13 is the most closely related coronavirus genome to nCoV-2019, however other viral strains may have contributed to its genomic content. To explore this hypothesis, we examined several viral metagenomic datasets for potential coronaviruses that could harbor RBMs closer to nCoV-2019. We report evidence of a coronavirus recovered from a Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) viral metagenomic dataset 3 that shares a higher sequence identity at a crucial segment of the genome involved in host infection ( Figure 1 ). This result indicates a potential recombination event and a more complex origin for the nCoV-2019 strain."
A Novel Method for the Estimation of a Dynamic Effective Reproduction Number (Dynamic-R) in the CoViD-19 Outbreak A Novel Method for the Estimation of a Dynamic Effective Reproduction Number (Dynamic-R) in the CoViD-19 Outbreak,"The CoViD-19 outbreak has escalated to a pandemic in the last few weeks, with no signs of stopping. Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive. In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results.","The CoViD-19 outbreak has become increasingly severe, and no drugs so far have proved capable of stemming the viral growth. In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models of the viral growth on a large scale. This paper attempts to provide a responsive, timely model of the effective reproductive number, R, which is used in many epidemiological models. This would allow governments to attempt to tackle the pandemic more effectively in terms of public health, as it provides a valuable and dynamic metric of the pandemic."
Spike protein binding prediction with neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 1 2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute 24 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in 25 Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have 26 been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to 27 identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that 28 inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this 29 study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and 30 interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The 31 sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 32 compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to 33 interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that 34 SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies 35 used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein 36 and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the 37 binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by 38 antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may 39 have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that 40 F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide 41 crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-42 CoV-2. 43 44 45","for SARS-CoV [12] . Shi and colleges showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor but not 73 other CoV receptors, aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [13] . Ying and colleges 74 showed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) interacts with ACE2 75 [14] . McLaellen and colleges showed that ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein with much higher affinity than 76 to SARS-CoV S protein [15] . In addition, bioinformatic analysis proposed binding structure of RBD of S protein 77 (S-RBD) and ACE2 [16] . Thus, it is of great interest to identify neutralizing antibodies that can interact with 78 SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and interfere with the binding between viral S protein and host receptor ACE2."
Complex dynamics in an SIS epidemic model induced by nonlinear incidence,"We study an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate, describing the saturated mass action as well as the psychological effect of certain serious diseases on the community. Firstly, the existence and local stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria are investigated. Then, we prove the occurrence of backward bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and cusp type Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3. Finally, numerical simulations, including one limit cycle, two limit cycles, unstable homoclinic loop and many other phase portraits are presented. These results show that the psychological effect of diseases and the behavior change of the susceptible individuals may affect the final spread level of an epidemic. doi: bioRxiv preprint then ∆ > 0 if and only if R 0 > R * , ∆ = 0 if and only if R 0 = R * and ∆ < 0 if and only if R 0 < R * . It is obvious that R * < 1 and we can obtain the following theorem. 40 = q 20 = q 21 = q 22 = q 30 = q 31 = q 40 = 0.","In generic, the population, for an SIS model, is always separated into two compartments, susceptible and infective individuals. And, in most SIS epidemic models (see Anderson and May [2] ), the incidence takes the mass-action form with bilinear interactions. However, in practical, to describe the transmission process more realistic, it is necessary to introduce the nonlinear contact rates [1] ."
REPROGRAMMED PTEROPUS BAT STEM CELLS PRESENT DISTINCT IMMUNE SIGNATURE AND ARE HIGHLY PERMISSIVE FOR 2 HENIPAVIRUSES 3 4 5 Summary sentence: Somatic reprogramming provides new bat stem cells with unique immune,"Bats are unique among mammals due to the ability of powered flight and exceptional longevity. They 2 are also asymptomatic hosts for numerous viruses, including recently emerged zoonotic 3 Henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, which are highly pathogenic for humans and other mammals. 4 Better understanding of how bats control viral infection requires development of relevant permissive 5 cellular experimental models. By applying a somatic reprogramming protocol to Pteropus bat primary 6 cells, using a novel combination of ESRRB, CDX2, and c-MYC transcription factors, we generated 7 bat reprogrammed cells exhibiting stem cell-like characteristics and a neural stem cell-like molecular 8 signature. These cells present a unique interferon-stimulated transcriptomic signature and both 9 produce and respond to interferon type-I, highlighting differences between stem cells from bats and 10 other mammals. In contrast to primary bat cells, these reprogrammed cells are highly susceptible to 11 infection by Henipavirus, thereby enabling isolation of new bat viruses, study of virus-bat 12 interactions, and better understanding of bat biology.","Emergence of zoonotic diseases is increasing globally; thus the ability to predict and prevent viral 3 epidemics is a major objective for public health organizations. Among all emerging infectious 4 diseases, approximately 60% are of zoonotic origin 1 . Bats host a large number of human and animal 5 zoonotic viruses, including Henipaviruses 2 (Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV)), Coronaviruses (Severe 6 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 3 and Middle East Respiratory (MERS-CoV)) 4 , and 7 Filoviruses (Marburg 5 and Ebola viruses 6 ). These agents are among the most virulent pathogens 8 emerging from animal reservoirs and are capable of infecting a broad range of species, including 9 humans, while remaining asymptomatic in bats. Transmission of NiV from bats to humans occurs 10 either through intermediate host contamination 7, 8 or directly 9 via consumption of fruits or raw date 11 palm juice contaminated with bat saliva or urine. In the case of NiV-Bangladesh isolates, this may be 12 followed by inter-human transmission 10 . Henipaviruses are negative strand RNA viruses; both NiV 13 and HeV are responsible for outbreaks of respiratory and neurological diseases in Southeast Asia and 14 Australia, respectively, with a fatality rate of 40-100% 11 . NiV and Henipa-like viruses have been 15 detected molecularly and/or serologically in Pteropus bats from different Asian and African 16 Countries 12 , and worldwide distribution of these bat species poses a threat of future NiV pandemics 13 . 17 Bats are an ancient and diverse group of animals (the second largest order of mammals after rodents), 18 representing around 20% of all mammalian species 14 . Indeed, they are the most abundant and widely 19 distributed non-human mammalian species worldwide 15 . Bats, the only mammals capable of powered 20 flight, show extraordinary longevity compared with their corporal mass 16, 17 . Phylogenetic analyses 21 based on molecular data classified bats into two suborders: Yangochiroptera (microbat families) and 22 Yinpterochiroptera (including the non-echolocating Pteropodidae family, which contains the 23 Pteropus genus and the echolocating Rhinolophoidea) 18 . A large number of novel bat virus sequences 24 was identified in these two bat suborders, which diverged over 50 million years ago, suggesting a 25 long co-evolutionary history of bats and their viruses that have shaped unique host-pathogen 26 relationships 19 . In addition, bats harbor a markedly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than other 27 mammalian orders 20,21 . Although bat serology and viral genome sequencing permit detection of a 28 number of bat viruses, isolating them has been far more challenging. Studying the bat immune system 29 and bat/virus interactions provides valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying successful 30 control of viral infection, and may lead to novel approaches to managing viral spillover and 31 development of new antiviral strategies for humans 22 . As infection studies in bats are difficult to 32 implement due to the animal facility constraints and the absence of bat husbandry, it is crucial to 33 author/funder. All rights reserved.

First isolation and characterisation of Alongshan virus in Russia,"In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance Statement We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5±3.7 nm. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the Jingmen tick virus group.","In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered in different invertebrates. All of them share homology in the nonstructural proteins with the well-studied flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 and RNA helicase-protease NS3, but they differ greatly from each other regarding other proteins, as well as in overall genome size and structure ."
"Clinical features and outcomes of 221 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",Pan and ZY Peng are cocorresponding authors.,"In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as the COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China. 1 2 From bronchoalveolar lavage samples of the infected patients, a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated and identified as the causative agent. 3 Current studies have demonstrated that the COVID-19 shares over 88% homology with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SLCoVZC21, and that bats may be the most likely natural host. 4 However, whether the SARS-CoV-2 transmits directly from bats or through an intermediate host is still uncertain."
Clinical significance of IgM and IgG test for diagnosis of highly suspected COVID-19 infection,"Quick, simple and accurate diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is very important for the screening and therapy of patients.

An automated data processing and analysis pipeline for transmembrane proteins in detergent solutions,"The application of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to the structural characterization of transmembrane proteins (MPs) in detergent solutions has become a routine procedure at the most synchrotron BioSAXS beamlines around the world. SAXS provides overall parameters and low resolution shapes of solubilized MPs, but is also meaningfully employed in hybrid modeling procedures that combine scattering data with information provided by high-resolution techniques (eg. macromolecular crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy). Structural modeling of MPs from SAXS data is non-trivial, and the necessary computational procedures require further formalization and facilitation. We propose an automated pipeline integrated with the laboratory-information management system ISPyB, aimed at preliminary SAXS analysis and the first-step reconstruction of MPs in detergent solutions, in order to streamline high-throughput studies, especially at synchrotron beamlines. The pipeline queries an ISPyB database for available a priori information via dedicated services, estimates model-free SAXS parameters and generates preliminary models utilizing either ab initio, high-resolution-based, or mixed/hybrid methods. The results of the automated analysis can be inspected online using the standard ISPyB interface and the estimated modeling parameters may be utilized for further in-depth modeling beyond the pipeline. Examples of the pipeline results for the modelling of the tetrameric alpha-helical membrane channel Aquaporin0 and mechanosensitive channel T2, solubilized by n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside are presented. We demonstrate how the increasing amount a priori information improves the model resolution and enables deeper insights into the molecular structure of protein-detergent complexes.","Membrane proteins (MPs) are crucial for the normal functioning of an organism as they are involved in essential processes including signalling, nutrient and ion transport, maintaining biological membrane structure and integrity (1) (2) (3) (4) . They are encoded by about 30% of the human genome (5) and are major targets for modern therapeutic drugs.

"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of March 5, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far.","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic started with a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China back in December 2019 (1, 2). The initial cases have been linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, pointing to an animal source of the epidemic (3) . Subsequently, rapid humanto-human transmission of the disease was confirmed in January 2020, and the etiological agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV discovered in 2003 (4, 5) . The total global case tally has reached 95,333 infections including 3282 deaths and involving 85 countries as of March 5, 2020 (6) . As the virus continues to spread in the human population, obtaining an accurate ""real-time"" picture of the epidemic's trajectory is complicated by several factors including reporting delays and changes in the case definition (7, 8) . Although the epidemic appears to be on a downward trend in China, local transmission continues in Singapore, Italy, South Korea and Iran (2) . Therefore, detailed epidemiological data from these countries is needed to monitor transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time."
Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model,"Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data.","spreading, the epidemic spreading would never be eliminated out. And, if the starting date of intervention is delayed for 1 day than the date Jan. 23, the peak infected population will increase about 6351 individuals. If the delayed period is 3 days or 7 days, the increasing number would be 21621 or 65929 individuals, thus the peak infected number would up to 70714 and 115022 individuals."
Spread and control of COVID-19 in China and their associations with medical resources 3 4,"20 BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has 21 spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly 22 influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its 23 control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in 24 China. fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of 29 population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; 30 City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). 31 The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with 32 reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was 33 inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p <0.001) and infection rates (r =-0.4912, p <0.01). 34 Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r =-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure 35 rates (r = 0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. 36 CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily 37 to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and 38 adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved 39 prognosis of affected individuals.","Due to the Chinese Lunar New Year travel rush, the COVID-19 epidemic has gradually spread across 52 the country and even worldwide within a limited time frame 11 . In response to the situation, 53 unprecedented measures have been taken by central and local government to contain the outbreak 54 and prevent its further spread across China.

A novel defective recombinant porcine enterovirus G virus carrying a 2 porcine torovirus papain-like cysteine protease gene and a putative anti- 3 apoptosis gene in place of viral structural protein genes 4 5 6 Ryo Imai,"Enterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine 36 EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in 37 Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, 38 and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene 39 replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese 40 farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking 41 sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream 42 flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the 43 downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence 44 homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the 45 novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G.

An anti-Gn glycoprotein antibody from a convalescent patient potently 2 inhibits the infection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious 24 disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea that is characterized by severe hemorrhage and a 25 high fatality rate. Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this 26 disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-27 displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS 28 virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope 29 glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in 30 vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 31 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass 32 spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn 33 glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a 34 conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host 35 cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 36 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 37 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that 38 Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more 39 than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates. 40 41","Type I interferon (interferon α/β) receptor gene (IFNAR1) deficient A129 mice (n = 5 144 per group) were subcutaneously injected with the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain of SFTSV at a 145 dose of either 2 or 20 plaque forming units (PFU). After 1 h, mice were intraperitoneally 146 administered with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Ab10, MAb4-5, or a human IgG 1 147 isotope control antibody at a dose of 600 μg (approximately corresponding to 30 mg/kg of 148 body weight); for 4 days at 24 h intervals, the injection of the same amount of antibody was 149 performed (Fig 2A) . 176 ranging from 10 pM to 1 nM ( Fig 4A) . Further, the amount of antibody bound to the HB29 177 and SD4 Gn glycoproteins coated on the ELISA plate was higher than that of the 178 Gangwon/Korea/2012 glycoproteins, at most of the tested concentrations. We also found that 179 Mab4-5 was reactive to Gn glycoprotein from the HB29 and SD4 strains ( Fig 4B) . 180 We used surface plasmon resonance analysis to determine the kinetics of Ab10 181 binding to the Gn glycoprotein of Gangwon/Korea/2012.

Importantly, the effects of age can be augmented by factors associated with severity of HIV infection and medical comorbidities which may influence the trajectory of HIV infection and cognitive and brain aging."
AI-aided design of novel targeted covalent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2,"The focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir) has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CL pro or M pro ) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These compounds can be used as potential candidates for researchers in their development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of coronavirus example, the recently solved structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (PDB ID: 6LU7)"
Lung epithelial cells have virus-specific and shared gene expression responses 1 to infection by diverse respiratory viruses 2 3,"The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular 9 response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our 10 understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host 11 responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We used microarray analysis 12 to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory 13 viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, 14 PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect 15 peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued 16 to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses 17 elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon 18 response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense 19 genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative 20 approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to 21 discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.","Murine models of respiratory viral infections have been widely used to identify the mechanisms that 32 determine disease severity in the respiratory tract. While these models are invaluable for evaluating pathology 33 and host responses to infection, parallel in vitro studies can be used to identify gene expression and signaling 34 pathway changes that occur in infected cells to mediate pathogenesis. In this study, we compare the gene 35 expression response of murine lung epithelial cells to infection by three respiratory viruses used in murine 36 models: rhinovirus (serotype RV1B) in the family Picornaviridae, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV strain 1) in the 37 family Coronaviridae, and influenza A virus (strain PR8) in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses from 38 different families and with different replication strategies were chosen to identify which responses to infection 39 in respiratory epithelial cells are shared and which are virus-specific. In the following paragraphs, we describe 40 some of the key features of these three viruses in murine models."
,"While the ecology of infectious disease is a rich field with decades worth of empirical evidence and theory, there are aspects that remain relatively under-examined. One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, and especially is cases where they are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. In this study, we develop an integrated, broadly applicable mathematical method to examine diseases fitting this description-the waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted (W.A.I.T.) infection framework. To demonstrate its utility, we construct realistic models of two very different epidemic scenarios: cholera in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water and hepatitis C virus in an urban setting of injection-drug users. Using these two exemplars, we find that the W.A.I.T. model fortifies the centrality of reservoir dynamics in the ""sit and wait"" infection strategy, and provides a way to simulate a diverse set of intervention strategies.","E cology and evolutionary biology have provided a theoretical basis for understanding how interactions between pathogens and their environment shape epidemics. When combined with quantitative modeling methods, it offers a full systems perspective that has helped to characterize the actors, forces and interactions that create infectious diseases [1] - [9] . Classically, the pathogen-host interaction is the presumptive central determinant of infectious disease, and consequently, the focus of modeling efforts: understand it, model it carefully, and one gains a picture for how epidemics arise and persist."

Kallikrein 13: a new player in coronaviral infections. 1 2,"Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is 36 prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the 37 coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host 38 specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular 39 elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory 40 epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. 41 We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving 42 that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that 43 protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus 44 and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may 45 be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand 46 the differences in their zoonotic potential. : bioRxiv preprint","HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of both inhibitors (Fig. 2B) . All inhibitors were used 151 at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 2C) . 152 The experiments conducted so far suggested that KLK13 is required for virus infection. 153 However, one may question the specificity of the KLK13 protease inhibitors. To ensure that 154 KLK13 is indeed the priming enzyme during HCoV-HKU1 infection, we developed HAE 155 cultures by transforming cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting KLK13 156 mRNA. We then confirmed that the expression of the protease was silenced (HAE_shKLK13). (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, HAE_shKLK13 cells continued to differentiate and formed 162 pseudostratified cultures (Fig. 3B) . Next, we infected HAE_ctrl, HAE_GFP, HAE_vector, and 163 HAE_shKLK13 with HCoV-HKU1 (10 6 RNA copies per ml) and incubated them for 2 h at 164 32°C with the viral stock solution.

Chemogenetic evidence that rapid neuronal de novo protein synthesis is 3 required for consolidation of long-term memory Introduction 82,"Translational control of memory processes is a tightly regulated process where the coordinated interaction and 47 modulation of translation factors provides a permissive environment for protein synthesis during memory 48 formation. Existing methods used to block translation lack the spatiotemporal precision to investigate cell-49 specific contributions to consolidation of long-term memories. Here, we have developed a novel chemogenetic 50 mouse resource for cell type-specific and drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition (ciPSI) that utilizes an 51 engineered version of the catalytic kinase domain of dsRNA-activated protein (PKR). ciPSI allows rapid and 52 reversible phosphorylation of eIF2α causing a block on general translation by 50% in vivo.

Saturation mutagenesis genome engineering of infective ΦX174 bacteriophage via unamplified oligo pools and golden gate assembly,"Here we present a novel protocol for the construction of saturation single-site-and massive multi-site-mutant libraries of a bacteriophage. We segmented the ΦX174 genome into 14 non-toxic and non-replicative fragments compatible with golden gate assembly. We next used nicking mutagenesis with oligonucleotides prepared from unamplified oligo pools with individual segments as templates to prepare near-comprehensive single-site mutagenesis libraries of genes encoding the F capsid protein (421 amino acids scanned) and G spike protein (172 amino acids scanned). Libraries possessed greater than 99% of all 11,860 programmed mutations. Golden Gate cloning was then used to assemble the complete ΦX174 mutant genome and generate libraries of infective viruses. This protocol will enable reverse genetics experiments for studying viral evolution and, with some modifications, can be applied for engineering of therapeutically relevant bacteriophages with larger genomes.","Predicting the tempo and trajectory of evolutionary change in the complex environments encountered by viruses and bacteria remains a challenge (Holmes 2013 , Neher 2013 , Lieberman et al. 2014 ). Understanding such changes are important for fundamental evolutionary studies as well as biotechnology applications like phage therapy for multi-drug resistant bacteria (Dedrick et al. 2019) . Two obstacles preventing better predictions are the oversimplification of the environment in experimental evolution studies compared to wild conditions and the vast number of experimentally unexplored mutational combinations that can occur, even in short adaptive walks and small genomes. Advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis have opened new ways to study microbial evolution and overcome some of these obstacles (Barrick et al. 2013 , Fowler et al. 2014 . Unfortunately, suitable methods do not exist for generating comprehensive bacteriophage mutant libraries. This technology gap hinders those seeking to engineer phage for biotechnological applications and for those seeking a deeper understanding of how viruses evolve."
Direct nanopore sequencing of mRNA reveals landscape of transcript isoforms in apicomplexan parasites,"Alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon in metazoans by which single genes are able to produce multiple isoforms of the gene product. However, this has been poorly characterised in apicomplexans, a major phylum of some of the most important global parasites. Efforts have been hampered by atypical transcriptomic features, such as the high AT content of Plasmodium RNA, but also the limitations of short read sequencing in deciphering complex splicing events. In this study, we utilised the long read direct RNA sequencing platform developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to survey the alternative splicing landscape of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum. We find that while native RNA sequencing has a reduced throughput, it allows us to obtain full-length or near full-length transcripts with comparable quantification to Illumina sequencing. By comparing this data with available gene models, we find widespread alternative splicing, particular intron retention, in these parasites. Most of these transcripts contain premature stop codons, suggesting that in these parasites, alternative splicing represents a pathway to transcriptomic diversity, rather than expanding proteomic diversity. Moreover, alternative splicing rates are comparable between parasites, suggesting a shared splicing machinery, despite notable transcriptomic differences between the parasites. This work highlights a strategy in using long read sequencing to understand splicing events at the whole transcript level, and has implications in future interpretation of RNA-seq studies.","zoonoses that primarily impacts immunocompromised, young, and pregnant individuals [2] , and is thought to infect a third of the world's population [3] .

We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis.

"A quantitative narrative on movement, disease and patch exploitation in nesting agent groups","Animal relocation data has recently become considerably more ubiquitous, finely structured (collection frequencies measured in minutes) and co-variate rich (physiology of individuals, environmental and landscape information, and accelerometer data). To better understand the impacts of ecological interactions, individual movement and disease on global change ecology, including wildlife management and conservation, it is important to have simulators that will provide demographic, movement, and epidemiology null models against which to compare patterns observed in empirical systems. Such models may then be used to develop quantitative narratives that enhance our intuition and understanding of the relationship between population structure and generative processes: in essence, along with empirical and experimental narratives, quantitative narratives are used to advance ecological epistemology. Here we describe a simulator that accounts for the influence of consumer-resource interactions, existence of social groups anchored around a central location, territoriality, group-switching behavior, and disease dynamics on population size. We use this simulator to develop new and reinforce existing quantitative narratives and point out areas for future study.","1 Disease ecology is a rich field of study that synthesizes inter alia demographic, epidemic, 2 behavioural, movement, spatial and community processes in an ecological setting [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . 3 Thus, understanding the impact of particular diseases on wild populations in ecological 4 settings is a challenge that requires a comparison of the spatial and community structure 5 of these focal populations, as they might arise in the absence versus the presence of the 6 causative agents of the diseases of interest.

Strategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinformatics techniques,"The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also.

Stochastic dynamics of an epidemics with recurrent spillovers from an endemic reservoir,"Most emerging human infectious diseases have an animal origin. Yet, while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases.","modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and (ii) that an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host."
Strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between COVID-19 and SARS-related coronaviruses,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be preadapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2) has caused the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has emerged as a serious public health concern.

Despite their relatively distant phylogenetic relationships, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are both known to be capable of infecting humans using the same cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 5,6,9,10 , and their protein structures of receptor-binding protein spike (S) are found to be highly similar to each other 10,11 , suggesting their phenotypic convergence. The spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, and it is important for host tropism and transmission capacity 6 . The spike protein of coronaviruses comprises two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptorbinding domain (RBD), which harbors a receptor-binding motif (RBM) to make complete contact with the receptor (i.e., ACE2) 12,13 ."
Substrate specificity profiling of SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease provides basis for anti-COVID-19 drug design,"In December 2019, the first cases of a novel coronavirus infection were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.","In December 2019, a severe respiratory disease of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan,"

Virome heterogeneity and connectivity in waterfowl and shorebird Running Title: Viromes of waterbird communities 4 5,"Models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single 21 pathogen. In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an 22 assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of 23 nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the 24 presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses 25 (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, 26 ","Abstract 20 Models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single 21 pathogen. In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an 22 assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of 23 nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the 24 presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses 25 (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, 26 Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus 27 (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, 28 indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two 29 well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel 30 Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was 31 reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably, 32 within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or 33 foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A 34 virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus. Overall, we 35 demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species 36 aggregations."
Electroporated recombinant proteins as tools for in vivo functional,"Delivery of native or chemically modified recombinant proteins into mammalian cells shows 31 promise for functional investigations and various technological applications, but concerns 32 that sub-cellular localization and functional integrity of delivered proteins may be affected 33 remain high. Here, we surveyed batch electroporation as a delivery tool for single 34 polypeptides and multi-subunit protein assemblies of kinetochores, a spatially confined and 35 well-studied subcellular structures. After electroporation in human cells, recombinant 36 fluorescent Ndc80 and Mis12 multi-subunit complexes displayed native localization, 37 physically interacted with endogenous binding partners, and functionally complemented 38 depleted endogenous counterparts to promote mitotic checkpoint signaling and 39 chromosome segregation. Farnesylation is required for kinetochore localization of the 40 Dynein adaptor Spindly. In cells with chronically inhibited farnesyl transferase activity, in 41 vitro farnesylation and electroporation reconstituted robust kinetochore localization of 42","can reach very high concentrations, we observed linear uptake characteristics over a broad 140 range of input protein concentrations in the EP slurry ( Figure S1A-B) , indicating that EP 141 allows for semi-quantitative delivery of recombinant proteins. In turn, this allows for the 142 generation of cell populations harboring defined amounts of exogenously delivered proteins 143 ( Figure S1C-D) . Importantly, EP is efficient across multiple cell lines and treated cells show 144 little or no sign of damage or toxicity ( Figure S1A and D-F). 145"
Arenaviridae exoribonuclease presents genomic RNA edition capacity,"The Arenaviridae is a large family of viruses causing both acute and persistent infections and causing significant public health concerns in afflicted regions. A ""trademark"" of infection is the quick and efficient immuno-suppression mediated in part by a 3'-5' RNA exonuclease domain (ExoN) of the Nucleoprotein (NP). Mopeia virus, the eastern African counterpart of Lassa virus, carries such ExoN domain, but does not suppress the host innate immunity. We have recently reported the crystal structure of the Mopeia virus ExoN domain, which presents a conserved fold and active site. In the present study, we show that the ExoN activity rules out a direct link between ExoN activity and alteration of the host innate immunity. We found that the Arenavirus ExoN, however, is able to excise mis-incorporated bases present at the 3'-end of double stranded RNA.",ratio of 1.2:1).
"ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism","Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2","expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection."

Encoding of odor fear memories in the mouse olfactory cortex,"Odor memories are exceptionally robust and essential for animal survival. The olfactory (piriform) cortex has long been hypothesized to encode odor memories, yet the cellular substrates for olfactory learning and memory remain unknown. Here, using intersectional, cFos-based genetic manipulations (""Fos-tagging""), we show that olfactory fear conditioning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons in mouse piriform cortex. We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fostagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall. Together, our experiments identify odor-specific ensembles of piriform neurons as necessary and sufficient for odor fear memory recall. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Realtime 2-5A kinetics suggests interferons β and  evade global arrest of translation by RNase L,"Cells of all mammals recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a foreign material. In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here we developed a biosensor for 2',5'oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. We found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However,","Interferons IFNs of type I ( and β) and type III (1, 2 and 3) are cytokines secreted by cells after exposure to pathogens or internal damage. Both types of IFNs activate strong transcriptional programs in surrounding tissues and have a central role in the innate immune system. Production of the IFNs requires protein synthesis."
