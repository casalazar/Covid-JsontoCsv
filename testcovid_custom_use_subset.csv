Complete Genome Sequence of Bordetella bronchiseptica Strain KM22,"Bordetella bronchiseptica isolate KM22 has been used in experimental infections of swine as a model of clinical B. bronchiseptica infection and to study host-to-host transmission. The draft genome sequence of KM22 was reported in 2014. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of KM22.","20-kb insert library preparation protocol (https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/ Procedure-Checklist-20-kb-Template-Preparation-Using-BluePippin-Size-Selection -System.pdf). The 20-kb library was sequenced with a PacBio RS II platform using two single-molecule real-time (SMRT) cells, resulting in 283,436 total reads and an average read length of 7,600 bp. Reads were subsequently assessed for quality using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)."
Two novel HLA-A*0201 T-cell epitopes in avian H5N1 viral nucleoprotein induced specific immune responses in HHD mice,"The influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) is an attractive target for avian flu vaccine development because of its high conversancy in the evolutionary chain of the virus. Here we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 restricted NP epitopes, named H5N1 NP373-381 AMDSNTLEL (NP373) and NP458-466 FQGRGVFEL (NP458), using computational bioinformatic analysis. The NP peptides showed a high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells, and were able to induce the activation of the cytotoxic T cells in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We examined the potential of using NP373 and NP458 peptide sequences supplemented with a single-chain trimer as potential DNA vaccine candidates in an HHD transgenic mouse model. A gene gun delivery system was used for administrating the vaccine candidates into the animals. The results from cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays indicated that a significant amount of IFN-c was secreted by the T cells of the vaccinated mice, and the T cells were able to eliminate the corresponding peptide-loaded T2 cells. The discovery of these novel immunogenic NP peptides provides valuable information for avian flu vaccine design and construction.","The transmission of a pathogenic avian H5N1 virus from poultry to humans in Hong Kong and other Asian countries has caused a number of human deaths [13, 17, 19] . Confirmed cases of H5N1 transmission have also been reported in various African and European countries 1 and all incidences have caused an enormous economic loss in the poultry industries worldwide. The threat of an H5N1 pandemic is becoming a major problem not only in Asian countries but countries worldwide. The urgency of developing a strategy to combat the H5N1 virus is an imperative task for most health authorities, and one possible solution is to develop a human vaccine against the H5N1 virus."
Protective Effects of Long Pentraxin PTX3 on Lung Injury in a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Model in Mice,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 reinforces the potential of lethal pandemics of respiratory viral infection s. The underlying mechanisms of SARS are still largely undefined. Long pentraxin PTX3, a humoral mediator of innate immunity, has been reported to have anti-viral effects. We examined the role of PTX3 in Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3 deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild type littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung; attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung. Results from this study indicate a protective role of PTX3 in coronaviral infectioninduced acute lung injury.","acute lung injury; inflammatory response; neutrophil infiltration; pulmonary viral infection; transgenic mice Viral infections are the most common cause of respiratory infectious diseases, such as the common cold and seasonal influenza. In certain circumstances, airway viral infections lead to severe lung injury and become life-threatening diseases, especially in patients at the extremes of age (<6 and >60) or with pre-existing medical conditions (1, 2) . In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a coronavirus resulted in approximately 8,000 cases with over 700 deaths globally (3) . The potential for global viral pandemics was further illustrated by the outbreak of H5N1 influenza (avian flu) in 2008 and H1N1 influenza (swine flu) in 2009, with severe morbidity and mortality, as well as high economic costs (1) . Although a number of studies in both animal models of SARS (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) and in patients with SARS (9) have been published, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection have not been fully elucidated."
"Veterinary Science Short Communication Prevalence of feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus and Chlamydophila felis in clinically normal cats at a Korean animal shelter","The prevalence of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), and Chlamydophila (C.) felis was studied in cats of an animal shelter in Korea. Total 78 cats without ocular and upper respiratory tract disease were examined. Specimens were obtained from ocular conjunctiva and oropharynx. Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR, three pathogens were simultaneously detected. In examined 78 cats, 49 (63%) cats were positive for FHV-1. However, all specimens were negative for C. felis and FCV. In conclusion, many cats recovered from FHV-1 infection remain subclinical carriers in shelter environment.","Feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) is the most frequent cause of conjunctivitis, and it also induces corneal ulcers, stromal keratitis, corneal sequestration and keratoconjunctivitis sicca in cats [14] . Chlamydophila (C.) felis (previously called Chlamydia psittaci) is another major conjunctival pathogen [13] . Feline calicivirus (FCV) is an unlikely and minor primary conjunctival pathogen [9] . It is considered to be the most common upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) associated pathogen in cats [16] . The prevalence of FHV-1, FCV and C. felis in cats throughout the world has been frequently reported [1] [2] [3] 5, 6, 12, 15, 16] . However, there have been relatively fewer of these studies for clinically normal cats in a shelter environment [1, 5, 11] and no such research has been done in Korea. The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence of FHV-1, FCV and C. felis in clinically normal cats of a Korean animal shelter by performing multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/PCR. Samples were collected from one animal shelter (Yangju, Korea) during January 2005. The animals were held at least 30 days and euthanasia was performed because of illness or injury, or insufficient available space. The shelter was traditional with no quarantine for incoming cats, but the cats having diseases were separated from the main shelter. A total of 78 cats were examined before they underwent euthanasia. Based on their history and ophthalmic (using slit lamp biomicroscopy) and physical examinations, they had clinically normal eyes and they had no specific clinical signs of URTD. All the cats were domestic short-haired or long-haired. The number of male cats examined was 40 and 38 were females. The cats' age and neuter and vaccination status could not be exactly determined. For each cat, specimens were obtained using three sterile cotton tipped swabs in the conjunctival sac of both eyes and the oropharynx, respectively. These were preserved in 2 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M NaPO 4 , pH 7.0) and they were immediately sent to the laboratory within 2 h and then stored at 70 o C until they were assayed. Before the subsequent nucleic acid extraction, the specimens that were separately obtained from the three sites were thoroughly mixed. One commercial vaccine (Felocell CVR-C; Pfizer Animal Health, USA) was used as a positive control. It was the only licensed vaccine for preventing FHV-1, FCV and C. felis in Korea at the time of the study. Sterile distilled water without nucleic acids was used as a negative control. Both the controls were subjected to nucleic acid extraction and PCR. The nucleic acids were extracted from specimens by using the Viral Gene-spin kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions."
Detection of Group 1 Coronaviruses in Bats in North America,"The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Bats of several species in southern People's Republic of China harbor SARS-like CoVs and may be reservoir hosts for them. To determine whether bats in North America also harbor coronaviruses, we used reverse transcription-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA in bats. We found coronavirus RNA in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested. The prevalence of viral RNA shedding was high: 17% in Eptesicus fuscus and 50% in Myotis occultus. Sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats. Because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals, further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in North America are needed.","E merging diseases are frequently zoonoses caused by RNA viruses (1, 2) . Defense against emerging infectious diseases, identifi cation of reservoirs for such viruses, surveillance for host-jumping events, and elucidation of viral and host factors that may facilitate such events are warranted. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was caused by a newly emerged zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus). Other coronaviruses have also jumped to new host species and caused emerging diseases. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus emerged in European pigs from an unknown host species during the late 1970s and caused severe enteric disease (3) . Human coronavirus OC43 is believed to have been derived from bovine coronavirus (4) . In addition, the genomes of canine and feline coronaviruses can recombine in vivo and have developed into different biotypes that are serially transmissible in their new host species (5) ."

,"A new hepatitis E virus (HEV-7) was recently found in dromedaries and 1 human from the United Arab Emirates. We screened 2,438 dromedary samples from Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and 4 African countries. HEV-7 is long established, diversified and geographically widespread. Dromedaries may constitute a neglected source of zoonotic HEV infections.","H epatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide (1) . Four HEV genotypes belonging to the species Orthohepevirus A are commonly found in humans (HEV-1 through HEV-4). Genotypes 1 and 2 seem to be restricted to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 also occur in domesticated and wild animals. Zoonotic transmission by ingestion of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs, is the most likely zoonotic source of infection (1) ."
Public antibodies to malaria antigens generated by two LAIR1 insertion modalities,"We previously described two donors in whom the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a collagenbinding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 191, was inserted between the V and the DJ segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs)2. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:","individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. We report that 5-10% of malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to IEs without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By analyzing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA level, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the gDNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camellike LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientation and frame compatible with expression. Collectively, these results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant antibodies against IEs and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering."
Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor,The 2002-3 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history 1,"Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat CoVs, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RDB) of the S protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat fecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses the ACE2s from human, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness."
,"The survey was conducted in English and Spanish with a representative national sample of 1,697 adults age 18 and over, including an over-sample of adults who had children under age 18 in their households. Altogether 821 such adults with children were interviewed. In the overall results, this group was weighted to its actual proportion of the total adult population. The cooperation rate was 75%, and the response rate was 36%.","study has shown that even after weighting, landline telephone surveys will underestimate the prevalence of certain health behaviors. 3 The study used in this paper shows that low-income people are likely to encounter more problems than people from higher-income households. It is likely that these problems would be somewhat larger if cellphone-only households were included. However, even without these households, the results suggest that the problems of low-income people are large enough to warrant attention from public health officials."
"Lack of SARS Transmission among Public Hospital Workers, Vietnam","The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Vietnam was amplified by nosocomial spread within hospital A, but no transmission was reported in hospital B, the second of two designated SARS hospitals. Our study documents lack of SARS-associated coronavirus transmission to hospital B workers, despite variable infection control measures and the use of personal protective equipment.","V ietnam was one of the first countries affected by the global severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and on April 28, 2003, was the first country to be removed from the World Health Organization (WHO) list of SARS-affected countries. Sixty-one patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS were hospitalized in two hospitals, six of whom died; including the index case-patient. All case-patients were epidemiologically-linked to the index case-patient, and most outbreak amplification occurred within one hospital. We investigated whether nosocomial transmission occurred among healthcare workers in the second hospital."
,"Genome sequencing and virulence studies of 2 Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEVs) from bats in Yunnan, China, showed a close relationship with JEVs isolated from mosquitoes and humans in the same region over 2 decades. These results indicate that bats may play a role in human Japanese encephalitis outbreaks in this region.","The viruses used in this study were isolated from homogenates of the brains of bats by direct intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of 3-day-old suckling mice. Although isolate B58 was obtained in 1989, no further identification or characterization was conducted until this study. GB30 was identified as JEV by serologic analysis (8) . Inoculation in suckling mice was conducted following procedures approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China. Mice were observed 2× per day after inoculation, and every 2 hours after the onset of clinical signs. After euthanasia, supernatant from brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells. After the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), supernatant was harvested and passaged 3 more times. Virus stock was prepared from the previous passage and stored at -85 o C."
"Occasional review: Infl uenza in COPD: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment","Infl uenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections that in patients with underlying lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with exacerbations and excess morbidity and mortality. Typically, infl uenza B is associated with relatively mild, local outbreaks, whereas infl uenza A is the cause of world-wide pandemics. Upon infection, two antigens present on the viral surface, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase result in human immunity, but since many subtypes of these antigens exist that vary over time, immunity in the population is blunted. Vaccination is advocated in high-risk groups including patients with underlying (lung) diseases and in the elderly, and needs to be repeated annually with vaccines expected to cover the expected change in viral antigenicity. When started early, antiviral drugs, especially neuraminidase-inhibitors can be prescribed in adjunct to nonspecifi c interventions in an attempt to shorten disease duration and to prevent complications in case of an infl uenza infection. Currently, the effectiveness of antiviral drugs specifi cally in patients with COPD has not been proven.","It is believed that the risk of a pandemic outbreak of infl uenza is growing. Three pandemics occurred in the 20th century; most recently in 1968 which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. A new outbreak may have similar devastating results and is likely to affect elderly people, patients with reduced immunity, and patients suffering from chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
INHIBITORY EFFECT OF EMODIN ON RAW 264.7 ACTIVATED WITH DOUBLE STRANDED RNA ANALOGUE POLY I:C,"Background: Emodin (3-methyl-1, 6, 8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is a compound which can be found in Polygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR). PMR is the root of Polygonum multiflorum. PMR is used to treat dizziness, spermatorrhea, sores, and scrofula as well as chronic malaria traditionally in China and Korea. The anti-tumor property of emodin was already reported. However, anti-viral activity of emodin on macrophages are not fully reported. Materials and Methods: Effects of emodin on RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, were evaluated. Results: Emodin restored the cell viability in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 at concentrations of up to 50 μM. Emodin significantly inhibited the production of nitric oxide, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, RANTES, and IP-10 as well as calcium release and mRNA expression of signal transducer and activated transcription 1 (STAT1) in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study shows the inhibitory effect of emodin on poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 via calcium-STAT pathway.","To date, pandemic viral diseases such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Zika virus infection is still being undissolved. Both Ebola virus and Zika virus belong to the single-stranded RNA virus. In 2015, people of South Korea suffered from Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (a novel positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus). Recently, Zika virus disease in South America was reported to be dangerous for public health. Thus, it deserves to contemplate how to effectively deal with new pandemic infectious diseases such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Zika virus infection, and avian influenza."
Veterinary Science Sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene of infectious bronchitis viruses: identification of a novel phylogenetic group in Korea,"The S1 glycoprotein genes of these IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were classified into three groups according to their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns. For a comparison with the published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from the twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. The Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology with each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5-99.3% similarity with each other and 44.9-80.3% similarity with non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some of the IBV isolates appear to belong to a new group, different from the non-Korean IBV strains or from previously isolated Korean IBV strains. Specifically, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 represented a separate group. These findings suggest that the Korean IBVs appear to be continuously evolving.","The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes economically important upper respiratory and urogenital tract diseases in chickens, resulting in tracheal rales, sneezing, coughing, reduced weight gain, and reduction of egg production [5] . IBV, the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is found worldwide [5, 15] . The genome of IBV consists of a single-stranded sense RNA genome encoding four structural proteins, which are envelope glycoprotein, integral membrane glycoprotein, phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [15, 22] . The S glycoprotein is cleaved post-translationally by cellular proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits [4] . The globular S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, extending outward, whereas the S2 subunit anchors the S1 moiety to the viral membrane [1] . The S1 subunit is involved in viral infectivity, virus-neutralizing epitopes, serotype-specific sequences, and hemagglutinin activity [1] [2] [3] 11, 12] ."
,The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with communityacquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.,"In the previous issue of Critical Care, Salluh and colleagues [1] suggested evidence-based recommendations for corticosteroid therapy in community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct therapy for severe infection for roughly half a century. Contrasting with the clinical practice, researchers are continuing to argue the pros and cons of this therapeutic approach [2] ."
,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused an ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory tract infection in humans in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012. Dromedaries have been implicated as possible viral reservoirs. We used serologic assays to analyze 651 dromedary serum samples from the United Arab Emirates; 151 of 651 samples were obtained in 2003, well before onset of the current epidemic, and 500 serum samples were obtained in 2013. Recombinant spike protein-specific immunofluorescence and virus neutralization tests enabled clear discrimination between MERS-CoV and bovine CoV infections. Most (632/651, 97.1%) dromedaries had antibodies against MERS-CoV. This result included all 151 serum samples obtained in 2003. Most (389/651, 59.8%) serum samples had MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody titers >1,280.

Imported cases were detected in countries in Europe and Africa (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Tunisia) (3) ."
Regulation of the apoptosis-inducing kinase DRAK2 by cyclooxygenase-2 in colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is over-expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), rendering tumour cells resistant to apoptosis. Selective COX-2 inhibition is effective in CRC prevention, although having adverse cardiovascular effects, thus focus has shifted to downstream pathways. METHODS: Microarray experiments identified genes regulated by COX-2 in HCA7 CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo regulation of DRAK2 (DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2 or STK17b, an apoptosis-inducing kinase) by COX-2 was validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Inhibition of COX-2 induced apoptosis and enhanced DRAK2 expression in HCA7 cells (4.4-fold increase at 4 h by qRT-PCR, P ¼ 0.001), an effect prevented by co-administration of PGE 2 . DRAK2 levels were suppressed in a panel of human colorectal tumours (n ¼ 10) compared to normal mucosa, and showed inverse correlation with COX-2 expression (R ¼ À0.68, R 2 ¼ 0.46, P ¼ 0.03). Administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib to patients with CRC (n ¼ 5) induced DRAK2 expression in tumours (2.5-fold increase, P ¼ 0.01). In vitro silencing of DRAK2 by RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival following COX-2 inhibitor treatment. CoNCLUSION: DRAK2 is a serine -threonine kinase implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and is negatively regulated by COX-2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism for the effect of COX-2 on cancer cell survival.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer death, with worldwide one million new cases each year and as many as half a million cancer deaths annually (Boyle and Leon, 2002) . Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is increased in the majority of colorectal tumours (Eberhart et al, 1994) and this induction is associated with advanced tumour stage and correlates with poor clinical outcomes (Sheehan et al, 1999) . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit COX activity, show anti-neoplastic effects in vitro (Richter et al, 2001; Sheng et al, 1997) and human studies have demonstrated their use to be associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal neoplasia Sandler et al, 2003) . Although more recent studies have confirmed the chemopreventive activity of COX-2selective NSAIDs (Arber et al, 2006; Baron et al, 2006; Bertagnolli et al, 2006) , it is also clear that their long-term use is associated with an unacceptable increase in the risk of cardiovascular events (Bertagnolli et al, 2006; Bresalier et al, 2005) ."
Structural Insights into 5' Flap DNA Unwinding and Incision by the Human FAN1 Dimer,"Human FANCD2-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) is a DNA structure-specific nuclease involved in the processing of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). FAN1 maintains genomic stability and prevents tissue decline in multiple organs, yet it confers ICL-induced anti-cancer drug resistance in several cancer subtypes. Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 in complex with a 5' flap DNA substrate, showing that two FAN1 molecules form a head-to-tail dimer to locate the lesion, orient the DNA, and unwind a 5' flap for subsequent incision. Biochemical experiments further validate our model for FAN1 action, as structure-informed mutations that disrupt protein dimerization, substrate orientation, or flap unwinding impair the structure-specific nuclease activity. Our work elucidates essential aspects of FAN1-DNA lesion recognition and a unique mechanism of incision. These structural insights shed light on the cellular mechanisms underlying organ degeneration protection and cancer drug resistance mediated by FAN1. †","FAN1 possesses 5' flap endonuclease and 5'-3' exonuclease activities and is involved in a DNA ICL damage repair pathway [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . FAN1 is thought to be recruited to ICLs via its interaction with the monoubiquitinated form of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, and, accordingly, disruption of the nuclease activity of FAN1 sensitizes cells to ICL inducing agents [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In ICL repair, FAN1 is thought to co-operate with other nucleases to introduce DNA incisions necessary for the efficient unhooking of the ICL 1-6 . Interestingly, FAN1 inactivation can lead to chronic kidney diseases 7 and autism/schizophrenia 8 , linking defective DNA lesion repair with aging 9 and neurological disorders 8 .

,"We analyzed prospective data on 17,228 European patients who sought treatment at GeoSentinel sites from 1997 to 2007. Gastrointestinal illness (particularly in tourists), fever (those visiting friends and relatives [VFRs]), and skin disorders (in tourists) were the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Diagnoses varied by country of origin, region visited, or categories of travelers. VFRs who returned from sub-Saharan Africa and Indian Ocean islands were more likely to experience falciparum malaria than any other group. Multiple correspondence analysis identifi ed Italian, French, and Swiss VFRs and expatriate travelers to sub-Saharan Africa and Indian Ocean Islands as most likely to exhibit febrile illnesses. German tourists to Southeast and south-central Asia were most likely to seek treatment for acute diarrhea. Non-European travelers (12,663 patients from other industrialized countries) were less likely to acquire certain travel-associated infectious diseases. These results should be considered in the practice of travel medicine and development of health recommendations for European travelers.","a paradigm of an infectious disease that rapidly became global as highly viremic travelers acted as effi cient carriers of the virus (7) . After CHIKV-infected persons in eastern Africa, Indian Ocean islands, India, and Southeast Asia, a new CHIKV variant reached Europe and affected local populations in Italy through 1 infected traveler (the index case-patient) and transmission by indigenous European mosquito vectors (8) .

OJPHI Early-warning health and process indicators for sentinel surveillance in Early-warning health and process indicators for sentinel surveillance in Madagascar 2007-2011,"Background: Epidemics pose major threats in resource-poor countries, and surveillance tools for their early detection and response are often inadequate. In 2007, a sentinel surveillance system was established in Madagascar, with the aim of rapidly identifying potential epidemics of febrile or diarrhoeal syndromes and issuing alerts. We present the health and process indicators for the five years during which this system was constructed, showing the spatiotemporal trends, early-warning sign detection capability and process evaluation through timely analyses of high-quality data.","The concept of surveillance was developed principally for control of the transmission of infections and for the early detection of outbreaks. The main elements of surveillance methods have been described elsewhere. Surveillance is a continuous, systematic process of descriptive information collection, validation, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination for use in planning, and in the implementation and evaluation of public health policies and strategies for the prevention and control of diseases or disease outbreaks [1] [2] [3] . The public health problems approached in this way, including acute and chronic diseases and environmental hazards, are diverse, necessitating the development of tools for the timely monitoring of disease trends. Furthermore, surveillance systems must be evaluated regularly, to ensure that they provide valuable information in an efficient manner [4, 5] ."
Combining field epidemiological information and genetic data to comprehensively reconstruct the invasion history and the microevolution of the sudden oak death agent Phytophthora ramorum (Stramenopila: Oomycetes) in California,"Understanding the migration patterns of invasive organisms is of paramount importance to predict and prevent their further spread. Previous attempts at reconstructing the entire history of the sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California were limited by: (1) incomplete sampling; (2) the inability to include infestations caused by a single genotype of the pathogen; (3) collapsing of non-spatially contiguous yet genetically similar samples into large metasamples that confounded the coalescent analyses. Here, we employ an intensive sampling coverage of 832 isolates of Phytopthora ramorum (the causative agent of SOD) from 60 California forests, genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, to reconstruct its invasion. By using age of infestation as a constraint on coalescent analyses, by dividing genetically indistinguishable meta-populations into highly-resolved sets of spatially contiguous populations, and by using Bruvo genetic distances for most analyses, we reconstruct the entire history of the epidemic and convincingly show infected nursery plants are the original source for the entire California epidemic. Results indicate that multiple human-mediated introductions occurred in most counties and that further disease sources were represented by large wild infestations. The study also identifies minor introductions, some of them relatively recent, linked to infected ornamental plants. Finally, using archival isolates collected soon after the discovery of the pathogen in California, we corroborate that the epidemic is likely to have resulted form 3 to 4 core founder individuals evolved from a single genotype. This is probably the most complete reconstruction ever completed for an invasion by an exotic forest pathogen, and the approach here described may be useful for the reconstruction of invasions by any clonally reproducing organism with a relatively limited natural dispersal range.","Since the time-scale of most biological invasions is so short, population genetic inference based upon the neutral theory of molecular evolution is typically limited (at least for eukaryotes) to questions such as determining the geographic origin of the invasion, testing for bottlenecks, and testing for hybridization with native species (Fitzpatrick et al. 2012) . Viruses and pathogenic microbes (e.g. bacteria, phytoplasmas, and some fungi) with high mutation rates and short generation times may be exceptions to this rule and indeed genetic data are increasingly being used to trace disease transmission pathways. For example, the high-rate of nucleotide sequence evolution of RNA viruses permits detailed phylogenetic reconstructions of disease transmission pathways even within the short time-scale of epidemics. Disease outbreaks studied in this way include foot-and-mouth disease (Cottam et al. 2008) , HIV (Leitner and Albert 1999) , hepatitis C (Bracho et al. 2005) , Ebolavirus (Walsh et al. 2005) and SARS coronavirus (Liu et al. 2005) . Recent analytical advances are also beginning to permit the combining of genetic data with traditional epidemiological data (e.g. the tracing of contacts, timing and spatial proximity of infections). Within the field of disease ecology, the use of genetic data and their integration with information regarding the timing, spread and incidence of disease outbreaks has been more limited. This may be because of differences in specialization between field pathologists and molecular biologists (Milgroom and Peever 2003) , because of greater difficulty in obtaining detailed epidemiological data, and because basic knowledge about the population biology and genetics of many economically important pathogens is lacking (Fletcher et al. 2006; Goss et al. 2009b) . Although newly emergent plant pathogens are often typified by reduced genetic diversity due to strong bottlenecks experienced during intercontinental transport combined with the strictly clonal reproduction occurring when a single mating type is introduced (Engelbrecht et al. 2004; Garbelotto 2008; Gonthier and Garbelotto 2011) , strong directional selection processes may occur as introduced pathogens colonize new habitats (Goss et al. 2009b; Grünwald and Goss 2011; Paoletti et al. 2006) . Consequently, these pathogens experience local diversification that may be tracked at highly-variable neutral markers as novel genotypes emerge. This pattern of clonal evolution permits the identification of particular genotypes, which may be traced to infer the origins, relationships and transmission routes of epidemics (Cummings and Relman 2002; Goss et al. 2009b ). Such ''microbial forensics'' is made possible by the increasingly easy development of polymorphic markers and by the advent of coalescent algorithms that permit detailed assessment of population genetic parameters (e.g. effective population size and migration rates) over time (Grünwald and Goss 2011) . The power of these approaches can be enhanced by the integration of historical and epidemiological data (Milgroom and Peever 2003) ."
A Single-Cell Platform for Monitoring Viral Proteolytic Cleavage in Different Cellular Compartments Supplementary Issue: Biochemistry of the Individual Living Cell,"Infectious diseases affect human health despite advances in biomedical research and drug discovery. Among these, viruses are especially difficult to tackle due to the sudden transfer from animals to humans, high mutational rates, resistance to current treatments, and the intricacies of their molecular interactions with the host. As an example of these interactions, we describe a cell-based approach to monitor specific proteolytic events executed by either the viral-encoded protease or by host proteins on the virus. We then emphasize the significance of examining proteolysis within the subcellular compartment where cleavage occurs naturally. We show the power of stable expression, highlighting the usefulness of the cell-based multiplexed approach, which we have adapted to two independent assays previously developed to monitor (a) the activity of the HIV-1-encoded protease or (b) the cleavage of the HIV-1-encoded envelope protein by the host. Multiplexing was achieved by mixing cells each carrying a different assay or, alternatively, by engineering cells expressing two assays. Multiplexing relies on the robustness of the individual assays and their clear discrimination, further enhancing screening capabilities in an attempt to block proteolytic events required for viral infectivity and spread.","Viral-host cross talk and proteolysis. Viral infection has affected human health throughout history. The difficult, long, and expensive race to bring new drugs to the market is further convoluted by the appearance of new viral diseases rapidly spreading around the world. Among the most recent emerging viral pathogens, chikungunya virus, 1 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2 and Zika virus, [3] [4] [5] to mention a few, are of great concern to the World Health Organization. For example, the recent spike in Zika virus infection in several states of Brazil has health officials scrambling to understand the specific aspects of this virus's pathogenicity. [6] [7] [8] While vaccine development is under way and Zika-dengue virus cross-reacting antibodies have been described, [9] [10] [11] [12] antibody-dependent enhancement will need to be addressed. 13 Thus, as part of the efforts of the scientific community to alleviate the pain of existing and emerging epidemics, new and improved ways to study viral processes and understand the adverse effects on the host are in need. The intricate cross talk between virus and host is further evidenced by the inability of phenotypic-based approaches for antiviral discovery, at least at first, to identify the specific step or target affected. Focusing on discrete steps of the viral life cycle, from attachment and entry or decoating and replication of the viral genome to maturation or budding of infectious viral particles, facilitates a more pinpointed method to drug discovery. This approach can lead to targeted discovery if/when the specific drug target or viral/host process is known. Jonsson et al, 14 for example, have utilized real-time PCR to identify the relationship between enteroviruses and host cell receptor binding, in an attempt to establish improved methods for understanding specific interactions between the virus and its host. Additionally, Lundin et al 15 identified an inhibitor specifically targeting membrane-bound RNA synthesis in certain coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome. Each event in the life cycle can potentially serve as a target for antivirals when the basic mechanisms are understood or when the factors involved are known. Here, we focus on proteolysis, a critical step in the cross talk between virus and host with potential and yet unmet capabilities for drug discovery. Historically, the viral-encoded protease (when this exists) has been an obvious target for antivirals. The array of protease inhibitors (PIs) on the market against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease (for the sake of simplicity, only the HIV-1 protease will be referred to as PR) 16 or more recently against hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease 17, 18 exemplifies this fact. However, proteolysis in the context of viral infection is a much more complex process, defined by the cleavage of both viral and host proteins by either the viralencoded protease or host-encoded enzymes. 19, 20 Members of the Flaviviridae such as HCV and dengue virus (DenV) represent a good example. The viral proteome, which is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, is cleaved by the viral-encoded protease at sites facing the cytosol and by host peptidases, peptide peptidases, and protein convertases (mainly furin) in the membranous/luminal face. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] While the viral-encoded protease is the obvious target for the development of inhibitors, host-encoded proteases specifically acting on the viral proteome have not fully met their potential as candidates for the development of competitors."
New Respiratory Enterovirus and Recombinant Rhinoviruses among Circulating Picornaviruses,"Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are leading causes of respiratory infections. To evaluate genotypic diversity and identify forces shaping picornavirus evolution, we screened persons with respiratory illnesses by using rhinovirus-specifi c or generic real-time PCR assays. We then sequenced the 5′ untranslated region, capsid protein VP1, and protease precursor 3CD regions of virus-positive samples. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis identifi ed the large genotypic diversity of rhinoviruses circulating in humans. We identifi ed and completed the genome sequence of a new enterovirus genotype associated with respiratory symptoms and acute otitis media, confi rming the close relationship between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses and the need to detect both viruses in respiratory specimens. Finally, we identifi ed recombinants among circulating rhinoviruses and mapped their recombination sites, thereby demonstrating that rhinoviruses can recombine in their natural host. This study clarifi es the diversity and explains the reasons for evolution of these viruses.","H uman rhinoviruses (HRVs) and enteroviruses (HEVs) are leading causes of infection in humans. These 2 picornaviruses share an identical genomic organization, have similar functional RNA secondary structures, and are classifi ed within the same genus (www.ictvonline.org/virusTax-onomy.asp) because of their high sequence homology (1) . However, despite their common genomic features, these 2 groups of viruses have different phenotypic characteristics. In vivo, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas enteroviruses infect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other sites such as the central nervous system. However, some enteroviruses exhibit specifi c respiratory tropism and thus have properties similar to rhinoviruses (2) (3) (4) (5) . In vitro, most HRVs and HEVs differ by their optimal growth temperature, acid tolerance, receptor usage, and cell tropism. The genomic basis for these phenotypic differences between similar viruses is not yet fully understood."
Towards standardization of RNA quality assessment using user-independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces,"While it is universally accepted that intact RNA constitutes the best representation of the steady-state of transcription, there is no gold standard to define RNA quality prior to gene expression analysis. In this report, we evaluated the reliability of conventional methods for RNA quality assessment including UV spectroscopy and 28S:18S area ratios, and demonstrated their inconsistency. We then used two new freely available classifiers, the Degradometer and RIN systems, to produce user-independent RNA quality metrics, based on analysis of microcapillary electrophoresis traces. Both provided highly informative and valuable data and the results were found highly correlated, while the RIN system gave more reliable data. The relevance of the RNA quality metrics for assessment of gene expression differences was tested by Q-PCR, revealing a significant decline of the relative expression of genes in RNA samples of disparate quality, while samples of similar, even poor integrity were found highly comparable. We discuss the consequences of these observations to minimize artifactual detection of false positive and negative differential expression due to RNA integrity differences, and propose a scheme for the development of a standard operational procedure, with optional registration of RNA integrity metrics in public repositories of gene expression data.","Purity and integrity of RNA are critical elements for the overall success of RNA-based analyses, including gene expression profiling methods to assess the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single assay. Starting with low quality RNA may strongly compromise the results of downstream applications which are often labor-intensive, time-consuming and highly expensive. However, in spite of the need for standardization of RNA sample quality control, presently there is no real consensus on the best classification criteria. Conventional methods are often not sensitive enough, not specific for single-stranded RNA, and susceptible to interferences from contaminants present in the sample. For instance, when using a spectrophotometer, a ratio of absorbances at 260 and 280 nm (A 260 :A 280 ) greater than 1.8 is usually considered an acceptable indicator of RNA purity (1, 2) . However, the A 260 measurement can be compromised by the presence of genomic DNA leading to over-estimation of the actual RNA concentration. On the other hand, the A 280 measurement will estimate the presence of protein but provide no hint on possible residual organic contaminants, considered at 230 nm (3) (4) (5) . Pure RNA will have A 260 :A 230 equal to A 260 :A 280 and >1.8 (1) . A second check involves electrophoresis analysis, routinely performed using agarose gel electrophoresis, with RNA either stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) (6) (7) (8) (9) , or the more sensitive SYBR Green dye (10) . The proportion of the ribosomal bands (28S:18S) has conventionally been viewed as the primary indicator of RNA integrity, with a ratio of 2.0 considered to be typical of 'high quality' intact RNA (1) . However, these methods are highly sample-consuming, using 0.5-2 mg total RNA and often not sensitive enough to detect slight RNA degradation. Today, microfluidic capillary electrophoresis with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) has become widely used, particularly in the gene expression profiling platforms (11, 12) . It requires only a very small amount of RNA sample (as low as 200 pg), the use of a size standard during electrophoresis allows the estimation of sizes of RNA bands and the measurement appears relatively unaffected by contaminants.

A broad band shows DNA contamination ( Figure 1C ). As it is apparent from a review of the literature, the standard of a 2.0 rRNA ratio is difficult to meet, especially for RNA derived from clinical samples, and it now appears that the relationship between the rRNA profile and mRNA integrity is somewhat unclear (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . On the one hand, this may reflect unspecific damage to the RNA, including sample mishandling, postmortem degradation, massive apoptosis or necrosis, but it can reflect specific regulatory processes or external factors within the living cells. Altogether, it appears that total RNA with lower rRNA ratios is not necessarily of poor quality especially if no degradation products can be observed in the electrophoretic trace ( Figure 1D )."
Fluorescence Competition Assay Measurements of Free Energy Changes for RNA Pseudoknots †,"RNA pseudoknots have important functions, and thermodynamic stability is a key to predicting pseudoknots in RNA sequences and to understanding their functions. Traditional methods, such as UV melting and differential scanning calorimetry, for measuring RNA thermodynamics are restricted to temperature ranges around the melting temperature for a pseudoknot. Here, we report RNA pseudoknot free energy changes at 37°C measured by fluorescence competition assays. Sequence-dependent studies for the loop 1-stem 2 region reveal (1) the individual nearest-neighbor hydrogen bonding (INN-HB) model provides a reasonable estimate for the free energy change when a Watson-Crick base pair in stem 2 is changed, (2) the loop entropy can be estimated by a statistical polymer model, although some penalty for certain loop sequences is necessary, and (3) tertiary interactions can significantly stabilize pseudoknots and extending the length of stem 2 may alter tertiary interactions such that the INN-HB model does not predict the net effect of adding a base pair. The results can inform writing of algorithms for predicting and/or designing RNA secondary structures.","RNA pseudoknots are important motifs that are formed by base pairing between the nucleotides in a loop region and complementary bases outside the loop ( Figure 1A ). They exist widely in viral RNA (1) (2) (3) , rRNA (4, 5) , mRNA (6-10), tmRNA (11, 12) , ribozymes (13, 14) , telomerase RNA (15) (16) (17) (18) , aptamers (19) , and others and are important for ribosomal frameshifting (20, 21) , riboswitches (22) , catalysis (13, 17) , etc. (23) . A typical H-type RNA pseudoknot ( Figure 1B) is formed by two stems and two or three loops (2) . Loop 1 spans the deep major groove of stem 2, and loop 3 spans the shallow minor groove of stem 1. Loop 2, which is usually zero or one nucleotide, separates stems 1 and 2. For the formation of a pseudoknot, the lengths of the other loops have to meet some requirements (24) . Examination of the natural pseudoknots collected in Pseudo-Base (25) revealed different length distributions for each pseudoknot loop and stem (26) ."
Role of Human Polyomaviruses in Respiratory Tract Disease in Young Children,KI virus was detected in respiratory secretions of 8/367 (2.2%) symptomatic and 0/96 asymptomatic children (p = 0.215). WU virus was detected in 26/367 (7.1%) of symptomatic children and 6/96 (6.3%) asymptomatic children (p = 1.00). These human polyomaviruses may not independently cause respiratory tract disease in young children.,"Respiratory specimens from 2 groups of children (all <2 years of age) were collected in 2004 and screened for KIV and WUV. The fi rst group comprised symptomatic children whose respiratory specimens were submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut. These respiratory specimens tested negative for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfl uenza viruses (types 1-3), infl uenza viruses A and B, and adenovirus by direct fl uorescence antibody assay. The second group comprised asymptomatic children at the hospital-affi liated pediatric clinic for well-child care. Nucleic acids were extracted from each specimen by us-ing QIAamp nucleic acid purifi cation kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA).

The G/C clamp for each primer is underlined. (1, 2) . Positive and negative controls were included in each set of PCRs. All PCR products were sequenced.

TaqMan probe array for quantitative detection of DNA targets,"To date real-time quantitative PCR and gene expression microarrays are the methods of choice for quantification of nucleic acids. Herein, we described a unique fluorescence resonance energy transferbased microarray platform for real-time quantification of nucleic acid targets that combines advantages of both and reduces their limitations. A set of 3 0 amino-modified TaqMan probes were designed and immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern, and used as probes in the consecutive PCR carried out on the surface. During the extension step of the PCR, 5 0 nuclease activity of DNA polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets. The increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner. Using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic DNAs and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the TaqMan probe array. The results indicate that the TaqMan probe array on a planar glass slide monitors DNA targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity. This set-up offers the great advantage of real-time quantitative detection of DNA targets in a parallel array format.","To date real-time quantitative PCR and gene expression microarrays are the methods of choice for quantification of nucleic acids.

As of February 5, 2015, a total of 971 MERS cases and 356 associated deaths had been confirmed (2) .

Assessing the Epidemic Potential of RNA and DNA Viruses SYNOPSIS Get the content you want delivered to your inbox. · Table of Contents · Podcasts · Ahead of Print arƟcles · CME · Specialized Content,"Many new and emerging RNA and DNA viruses are zoonotic or have zoonotic origins in an animal reservoir that is usually mammalian and sometimes avian. Not all zoonotic viruses are transmissible (directly or by an arthropod vector) between human hosts. Virus genome sequence data provide the best evidence of transmission. Of human transmissible virus, 37 species have so far been restricted to self-limiting outbreaks. These viruses are priorities for surveillance because relatively minor changes in their epidemiologies can potentially lead to major changes in the threat they pose to public health. On the basis of comparisons across all recognized human viruses, we consider the characteristics of these priority viruses and assess the likelihood that they will further emerge in human populations. We also assess the likelihood that a virus that can infect humans but is not capable of transmission (directly or by a vector) between human hosts can acquire that capability.","A series of recent emerging infectious disease outbreaks, including the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa and the continuing Zika virus disease epidemic in the Americas, have underlined the need for better understanding of which kinds of pathogens are most likely to emerge and cause disease in human populations. Many, although not all, emerging infectious diseases are caused by viruses, and these frequently emerge from nonhuman host reservoirs (1) (2) (3) . The enormous diversity (4) and high rates of evolution (5) of viral pathogens discourage attempts to predict with any precision which ones are most likely to emerge in humans. However, there is some consensus, at least in general terms, regarding the kinds of traits that are most essential in determining the capacity of a virus to infect, cause disease, and spread within human populations (Table 1) . We focus on one of these traits, the capacity of a virus to spread from one human to another (by any transmission route other than deliberate laboratory exposure), a key determinant of the epidemic potential of a virus."
,"severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was based on rapid diagnosis coupled with effective patient isolation. We used uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R 0 to assess the role that model parameters play in outbreak control. The transmission rate and isolation effectiveness have the largest fractional effect on R 0 . We estimated the distribution of the reproductive number R 0 under perfect isolation conditions. The distribution lies in the interquartile range 0.19-1.08, with a median of 0.49. Even though the median of R 0 is <1, we found that 25% of our R 0 distribution lies at R 0 > 1, even with perfect isolation. This implies the need to simultaneously apply more than one method of control.","Taiwan, 94% of SARS cases occurred through transmission in hospital wards (6) , and similar effects occurred in Hong Kong and Singapore (7) . Although the SARS epidemic was eventually controlled, the measures used to achieve that control varied greatly in scope from one place to another. Control of an outbreak relies partly on identifying what disease parameters are likely to lead to a reduction in the reproduction number R 0 . Here we calculate the dependence of R 0 on model parameters."
"Lack of Transmission among Close Contacts of Patient with Case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Imported into the United States, 2014","In May 2014, a traveler from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was the first person identified with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the United States. To evaluate transmission risk, we determined the type, duration, and frequency of patient contact among health care personnel (HCP), household, and community contacts by using standard questionnaires and, for HCP, global positioning system (GPS) tracer tag logs. Respiratory and serum samples from all contacts were tested for MERS-CoV. Of 61 identified contacts, 56 were interviewed. HCP exposures occurred most frequently in the emergency department (69%) and among nurses (47%); some HCP had contact with respiratory secretions. Household and community contacts had brief contact (e.g., hugging). All laboratory test results were negative for MERS-CoV. This contact investigation found no secondary cases, despite case-patient contact by 61 persons, and provides useful information about MERS-CoV transmission risk. Compared with GPS tracer tag recordings, self-reported contact may not be as accurate.","M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lineage C betacoronavirus that was first reported in September 2012 in a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1). By September 8, 2014, a total of 837 laboratory-confirmed cases and 292 associated deaths had been reported by the World Health Organization. All reported case-patients have resided in or had recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries (2) ."
Lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak in Hong Kong,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global public health threat with many medical, ethical, social, economic, political, and legal implications. The nonspecific signs and symptoms of this disease, coupled with a relatively long incubation period and the initial absence of a reliable diagnostic test, limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. This paper outlines our experience with public health issues that have arisen during this outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. We confirmed that case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures are essential in handling such an infectious disease outbreak. The need for an outbreak response unit is crucial to combat any future outbreak.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China and, by February 2003, had spread to Hong Kong and subsequently to 32 other countries or regions, infecting approximately 8,459 patients and resulting in >800 deaths (1) . The overall mortality rate is approximately 14% to 15%, ranging from <1% in persons <24 years of age to >50% in persons >65 years of age (2) . The cause of SARS is not yet confirmed, but a novel coronavirus has been identified and resembles the virus found in civet cats (3, 4) . SARS is the latest in a series of new infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Nipah, and Avian H5N1 influenza) that are adding additional stress to a healthcare system already dealing with the resurgence of established conditions (e.g., dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis). As global air travel is now commonplace and has facilitated the international spread of SARS, identifying and globally publicizing the lessons learned from the latest outbreak are important."
Influence of Population Immunosuppression and Past Vaccination on Smallpox Reemergence,"We built a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model of smallpox transmission for New York, New York, USA, and Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that accounted for age-specific population immunosuppression and residual vaccine immunity and conducted sensitivity analyses to estimate the effect these parameters might have on smallpox reemergence. At least 19% of New York's and 17% of Sydney's population are immunosuppressed. The highest smallpox infection rates were in persons 0-19 years of age, but the highest death rates were in those >45 years of age. Because of the low level of residual vaccine immunity, immunosuppression was more influential than vaccination on death and infection rates in our model. Despite widespread smallpox vaccination until 1980 in New York, smallpox outbreak severity appeared worse in New York than in Sydney. Immunosuppression is highly prevalent and should be considered in future smallpox outbreak models because excluding this factor probably underestimates death and infection rates.","We built a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model of smallpox transmission for New York, New York, USA, and Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that accounted for age-specific population immunosuppression and residual vaccine immunity and conducted sensitivity analyses to estimate the effect these parameters might have on smallpox reemergence. At least 19% of New York's and 17% of Sydney's population are immunosuppressed. The highest smallpox infection rates were in persons 0-19 years of age, but the highest death rates were in those >45 years of age. Because of the low level of residual vaccine immunity, immunosuppression was more influential than vaccination on death and infection rates in our model. Despite widespread smallpox vaccination until 1980 in New York, smallpox outbreak severity appeared worse in New York than in Sydney.

DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites: Advances and Challenges,"Over the past 15 years, DNA vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. We review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of DNA vaccines against these diseases. Many studies have validated the concept of using DNA vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models. The challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy. Also, genome-mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates.","In spite of the success of vaccines in public health, there are still numerous pathogens, and in particular protozoan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma sp., or Leishmania sp. against which there are still no effective vaccine. However, the discovery that the direct injection of plasmid DNA encoding foreign proteins could lead to endogenous protein biosynthesis and a specific immune response against it opened new perspectives in vaccine development. Over 15 years later, DNA vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic fields of research and may offer new alternatives for the control of infectious diseases [1] . Indeed, the first two DNA vaccines have been licenced, in recent years, to protect horses from west nile virus and salmons from infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, confirming the usefulness of this biotechnology. We review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of DNA vaccines against two well-studied protozoan parasites, Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. Both belong to the trypanosomatidae family and are ranked among the three major protozoan parasites affecting humans. Leishmaniasis is a complex disease caused by at least 18 species of parasites from the Leishmania genus and transmitted to humans by hematophagous sandflies. With an estimated 12 million cases, it has a major public health impact in several regions, and in particular in India, Sudan, and Brazil [2] ."
A small stem-loop structure of the Ebola virus trailer is essential for replication and interacts with heat-shock protein A8,"ily. The leader and trailer non-coding regions of the EBOV genome likely regulate its transcription, replication, and progeny genome packaging. We investigated the cis-acting RNA signals involved in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that regulate replication of eGFP-encoding EBOV minigenomic RNA and identified heat shock cognate protein family A (HSC70) member 8 (HSPA8) as an EBOV trailer-interacting host protein. Mutational analysis of the trailer HSPA8 binding motif revealed that this interaction is essential for EBOV minigenome replication. Selective 2 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis of the secondary structure of the EBOV minigenomic RNA indicates formation of a small stem-loop composed of the HSPA8 motif, a 3 stem-loop (nucleotides 1868-1890) that is similar to a previously identified structure in the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA and a panhandle domain involving a trailer-to-leader interaction. Results of minigenome assays and an EBOV reverse genetic system rescue support a role for both the panhandle domain and HSPA8 motif 1 in virus replication.","Ebola virus (EBOV) can cause large and highly lethal human disease outbreaks. Because of the scarcity of effective treatments against EBOV, there is an urgent need to identify novel viral inhibitors that target specific viral processes. As of yet, relatively little is known about the molecular biology of EBOV replication, and, in particular, the interplay between host factors and the viral genome. The EBOV genome is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA organized into a 3 leader non-coding region (NCR), followed by seven discrete transcriptional units encoding NP (nucleocapsid protein), VP35 (polymerase cofactor and interferonresponse modulator), VP40 (matrix protein), GP 1,2 (glycoprotein), VP30 (transcriptional enhancer), VP24 (secondary matrix protein, ion channel and interferon-response modulator), L (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and a 5 trailer NCR (1, 2) . Each gene is separated by intergenic regions of varying lengths that modulate transcript levels (3) ."

,"An influenza pandemic threatens to be the most lethal public health crisis to confront the world. Physicians will have critical roles in diagnosis, containment and treatment of influenza, and their commitment to treat despite increased personal risks is essential for a successful public health response. The obligations of the medical profession stem from the unique skills of its practitioners, who are able to provide more effective aid than the general public in a medical emergency. The free choice of profession and the societal contract from which doctors derive substantial benefits affirm this commitment. In hospitals, the duty will fall upon specialties that are most qualified to deal with an influenza pandemic, such as critical care, pulmonology, anesthesiology and emergency medicine. It is unrealistic to expect that this obligation to treat should be burdened with unlimited risks. Instead, risks should be minimized and justified against the effectiveness of interventions. Institutional and public cooperation in logistics, remuneration and psychological/ legal support may help remove the barriers to the ability to treat. By stepping forward in duty during such a pandemic, physicians will be able to reaffirm the ethical center of the profession and lead the rest of the healthcare team in overcoming the medical crisis.","As the specter of an influenza pandemic looms, preparation is underway to cope with what may be the most lethal public health crisis to confront the world [1] . By virtue of their training and expertise, doctors will have a pivotal role in a successful response to a pandemic in the areas of detection, containment and treatment [2] . A commitment by physicians is needed to ensure that this role will be fulfilled despite the presence of an elevated level of personal risk arising from exposure to contagious influenza patients."
An analysis of the feasibility of short read sequencing,"Several methods for ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing are currently under investigation. Many of these methods yield very short blocks of sequence information (reads). Here we report on an analysis showing the level of genome sequencing possible as a function of read length. It is shown that resequencing and de novo sequencing of the majority of a bacterial genome is possible with read lengths of 20-30 nt, and that reads of 50 nt can provide reconstructed contigs (a contiguous fragment of sequence data) of 1000 nt and greater that cover 80% of human chromosome 1.","Several methods for ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing are currently under investigation (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Many of these methods yield very short blocks of sequence information (reads), with some proposed methods giving reads as small as 16 nt.

,"In Taiwan, a temperature-monitoring campaign and hotline for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) fever were implemented in June 2003. Among 1,966 calls, fever was recorded in 19% (n = 378); 18 persons at high risk for SARS were identified. In a cross-sectional telephone survey, 95% (n = 1,060) of households knew about the campaign and 7 households reported fever.","Our investigation evaluated the community-wide bodytemperature monitoring campaign and SARS fever hotline in the city of Taipei, which makes up 11.8% of the population of Taiwan (population of Taiwan, 22.51 million [9]).

Mannose-binding lectin deficiency and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Background: Mannose-binding lectin is a collectin involved in host defense against infection. Whether mannose-binding lectin deficiency is associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is debated. Methods: Participants in a study designed to determine if azithromycin taken daily for one year decreased acute exacerbations had serum mannose-binding lectin concentrations measured at the time of enrollment. Results: Samples were obtained from 1037 subjects (91%) in the trial. The prevalence of mannose-binding lectin deficiency ranged from 0.5% to 52.2%, depending on how deficiency was defined. No differences in the prevalence of deficiency were observed with respect to any demographic variable assessed, and no differences were observed in time to first exacerbation, rate of exacerbations, or percentage of subjects requiring hospitalization for exacerbations in those with deficiency versus those without, regardless of how deficiency was defined. Conclusion: In a large sample of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease selected for having an increased risk of experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, only 1.9% had mannose-binding lectin concentrations below the normal range and we found no association between mannose-binding lectin concentrations and time to first acute exacerbation or frequency of acute exacerbations during one year of prospective follow-up.","Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition collectin that is related to surfactant proteins A and D and has two roles in host defense. MBL activates complement via serine proteases, particularly MBL-associated serine protease-2, with which it circulates. 1,2 MBL is also involved in opsonophagocytosis, binding several types of pathogens to phagocytes via its carbohydrate recognition domain, triggering release of a number of proinflammatory cytokines [3] [4] [5] and facilitating clearance of apoptotic cells. 6 MBL is secreted primarily by the liver and circulates in the serum. Low MBL concentrations occur as a result of one of three single nucleotide polymorphisms on exon 1, but the most common cause of deficiency in Caucasians is the LXP haplotype resulting from polymorphisms of the promoter region of the gene, presenting either as a homozygous mutation or in combination with other haplotypes. [7] [8] [9] Several observations suggest that MBL deficiency may compromise host defense in the lungs. MBL binds to carbohydrates on the surface of a number of respiratory pathogens that are associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including Haemophilus influenzae, 10, 11 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 12 and influenza. 13 Patients with cystic fibrosis and low MBL concentrations have decreased lung function, an increased prevalence of Burkholderia cepacia infection, and reduced survival relative to patients with cystic fibrosis and normal MBL concentrations. The difference in survival is particularly notable in those with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and those with homozygous mutations in the MBL-2 gene. [14] [15] [16] [17] Low MBL concentrations have been associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections in immunocompetent subjects, [18] [19] [20] [21] with an increased frequency of respiratory syncytial virus infections, 22 and with worse outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. [23] [24] [25] [26] MBL concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from a small number of current and former smokers with COPD are lower than those in fluid from healthy controls and tend to be higher in former smokers than in current smokers, 27, 28 but no association has been found between genotypes producing low MBL concentrations and the prevalence of COPD. 29 However, studies assessing the association of low MBL concentrations with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) report conflicting results. [30] [31] [32] Accordingly, we prospectively measured MBL concentrations in a large cohort of subjects with COPD who were at increased risk of experiencing acute exacerbations and followed them for one year while tracking the number of acute exacerbations that occurred. Our hypothesis was that subjects with COPD who had an increased risk of experiencing an AECOPD would have more frequent acute exacerbations during one year of follow-up if they were deficient in MBL than if they were not."
Posttraumatic Stress after SARS,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can arise in patients with medical illness. We used 2 Chinese self-report measures to examine features of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in 131 survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome at 1 month and 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Risk factors associated with psychological distress were identified.","I n the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003, a total of 1,755 people were infected, and 299 died. Among the infected, 386 were healthcare workers (1) . According to the literature, a lifethreatening physical illness can lead to symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after recovery. The prevalence rates of PTSD are 1%-5% for childbirth and 14%-59% for a life-threatening situation in an intensive care unit (ICU) (2) . Predictors of PTSD identified in previous studies included aspects of the trauma itself, emotional support, and invasiveness of the medical intervention.

"Resistance Prediction in AML: Analysis of 4,601 Patients from MRC/NCRI, HOVON/SAKK, SWOG, and MD Anderson Cancer Center HHS Public Access","Therapeutic resistance remains the principal problem in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) to quantify our ability to predict therapeutic resistance in individual patients where AUC=1.0 denotes perfect prediction and AUC=0.5 denotes a coin flip, using data from 4,601 patients with newly diagnosed AML given induction therapy with 3+7 or more intense standard regimens in MRC/NCRI, HOVON, SWOG, and MD Anderson Cancer Center studies. Age, performance status, white blood cell count, secondary disease, cytogenetic risk, and FLT3-ITD/NPM1 mutation status were each independently associated with failure to achieve complete remission despite no early death (""primary refractoriness""). However, the AUC of a bootstrap-corrected multivariable model predicting this outcome was only 0.78, indicating only fair predictive ability. Removal of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 information only slightly decreased the AUC (0.76).

Our ability to forecast resistance based on routinely available pre-treatment covariates provides a rationale for continued randomization between standard and new therapies and supports further examination of genetic and post-treatment data to optimize resistance prediction in AML.","""Resistance"", defined as either failure to achieve initial complete remission (CR) or as relapse from CR, remains the principal problem in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). [1] [2] [3] It is widely appreciated that the likelihood of resistance to therapy differs significantly between individuals; e.g., the complete remission (CR) rate following initial chemotherapy is 80-90% in some patients but below 30% in others. 4, 5 The ability to accurately forecast resistance would have considerable significance for the management of AML and the evaluation of new drugs. Specifically, the better our ability to predict resistance to standard therapy, the less need there might be for randomization of patients between such therapy and an investigational therapy. The lack of a need to randomize would address a seldom discussed but very real ethical conundrum: physicians caring for AML patients generally are not enthusiastic about randomizing patients with features associated with resistance (older age, complex cytogenetics, secondary AML, etc.) to standard therapy but are willing to do so because they believe that our ability to predict resistance to standard therapy is only fair and, thus, that randomization is necessary to properly evaluate a new therapy. We therefore set out to test this belief by quantifying our current ability to predict resistance."
,"We determined the presence of neutralizing antibodies to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in persons in Qatar with and without dromedary contact.

Model answers or trivial pursuits? The role of mathematical models in influenza pandemic preparedness planning,"The panzootic of H5N1 influenza in birds has raised concerns that the virus will mutate to spread more readily in people, leading to a human pandemic. Mathematical models have been used to interpret past pandemics and outbreaks, and to thus model possible future pandemic scenarios and interventions. We review historical influenza outbreak and transmission data, and discuss the way in which modellers have used such sources to inform model structure and assumptions. We suggest that urban attack rates in the 1918-1919 pandemic were constrained by prior immunity, that R 0 for influenza is higher than often assumed, and that control of any future pandemic could be difficult in the absence of significant prior immunity. In future, modelling assumptions, parameter estimates and conclusions should be tested against as many relevant data sets as possible. To this end, we encourage researchers to access FluWeb, an on-line influenza database of historical pandemics and outbreaks.","Recent outbreaks of H5N1 influenza among domesticated poultry in South-East Asia have had unprecedented economic impacts. 1, 2 Seasonal migration of infected wild birds and trade in live poultry 3 have spread H5N1 viruses throughout Asia, Europe and Africa. Direct transmission of this avian virus to humans through contact with infected live birds, poultry products or excreta had caused 154 confirmed human deaths by November 2006, 4 with updates posted on the World Health Organization (WHO) website since that time (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_ influenza/updates/en/index.html). Earlier reports of suspected secondary infection in family members 1, 5 have been supported by recent evidence of human-to-human transmission of an H5N1 mutant within a household. 6 In the absence of prior immunity, the emergence of novel virus that is more readily transmissible could cause a human pandemic to rival or surpass the pandemics of 1889-1891, 7 1918-1919 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2). 1 Public health bodies and governments have sought urgent advice in planning how to respond to this new threat. 8 Why bother with mathematical models?"
EMERGENCE OF SARS,"We discuss crisis prevention and management during the first 3 months of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. Four public health issues were considered: prevention measures, self-health evaluation, SARS knowledge, and appraisal of crisis management. We conducted telephone interviews with a representative sample of 1,201 adults, >21 years of age. We found that sex, age, and attitude (anxiety and perception of open communication with authorities) were associated with practicing preventive measures.

Host Range and Emerging and Reemerging Pathogens Host Range and Emerging and Reemerging Pathogens Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"An updated literature survey identified 1,407 recognized species of human pathogen, 58% of which are zoonotic. Of the total, 177 are regarded as emerging or reemerging. Zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be in this category as are nonzoonotic pathogens. Emerging and reemerging pathogens are not strongly associated with particular types of nonhuman hosts, but they are most likely to have the broadest host ranges. Emerging and reemerging zoonoses are associated with a wide range of drivers, but changes in land use and agriculture and demographic and societal changes are most commonly cited. However, although zoonotic pathogens do represent the most likely source of emerging and reemerging infectious disease, only a small minority have proved capable of causing major epidemics in the human population.","A recent, comprehensive literature survey of human pathogens listed >1,400 different species (1), more than half known to be zoonotic, i.e., able to infect other host species (1, 2) .

Electrochemical Sensors for Clinic Analysis,"Demanded by modern medical diagnosis, advances in microfabrication technology have led to the development of fast, sensitive and selective electrochemical sensors for clinic analysis. This review addresses the principles behind electrochemical sensor design and fabrication, and introduces recent progress in the application of electrochemical sensors to analysis of clinical chemicals such as blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites, DNA and antibodies, including basic and applied research. Miniaturized commercial electrochemical biosensors will form the basis of inexpensive and easy to use devices for acquiring chemical information to bring sophisticated analytical capabilities to the non-specialist and general public alike in the future.","Since clinical analyses in a clinical chemistry laboratory are expensive and time-consuming processes, more and more measurements of analytes are performed in various locations, including hospital point-of-care settings, by caregivers in non-hospital settings and by patients at home. Today one of the main challenges is the development of methods to perform these rapid 'in situ' analyses. These methods must be sensitive and accurate, and able to determine various substances with different properties in 'real-life' samples. Electrochemical sensors for the measurement of analytes of interest in clinical chemistry are ideally suited for these new applications, due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, portable field-based size, rapid response time and low-cost."

Recently, SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated in Himalayan palm civets and racoon dogs in a retail live animal market in Guangdong Province, southern China (6) , and some of the animals tested had antibodies to SARS-CoV-like virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-like animal viruses were closely related to the viruses found in humans. Serologic surveillance demonstrated that, in the same market, approximately 40% of wild animal traders and 20% of animal slaughterers had antibodies to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like animal virus, but none of them had had SARS-like symptoms in the past 6 months. These investigations raised questions about whether the presence of the animal SARS-CoV-like virus in the market was an isolated event or if this virus had been prevalent in the human population in southern China before the SARS outbreak. A retrospective serologic study was conducted to address these questions."

H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza,"Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in migratory waterfowl, domestic poultry, and humans in Asia during the summer of 2005 present a continuing, protean pandemic threat. We review the zoonotic source of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses and their genesis from their natural reservoirs. The acquisition of novel traits, including lethality to waterfowl, ferrets, felids, and humans, indicates an expanding host range. The natural selection of nonpathogenic viruses from heterogeneous subpopulations cocirculating in ducks contributes to the spread of H5N1 in Asia. Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.","I nfluenza is an ancient disease that has infected humans at irregular intervals throughout recorded history (1) . While the 1918 ""Spanish"" influenza is the best recorded catastrophic influenza pandemic, similarly severe pandemics occurred earlier, when the human population of the world was much smaller, and they will occur again. Our challenge is to understand all aspects of the influenza virus, the hosts and their response, and the virus' global impact so that we may be better prepared to face the inevitable next influenza pandemic."
"Weather-Dependent Risk for Legionnaires' Disease, United States Legionella pneumophila [leʺjə-nelʹə nooʺmo-filʹə]","Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and US weather data, we estimated the probability of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) being diagnosed as Legionnaires' disease (LD). LD risk increases when weather is warm and humid. With warm weather, we found a dose-response relationship between relative humidity and the odds for LD. When the mean temperature was 60°-80°F with high humidity (>80.0%), the odds for CAP being diagnosed with LD were 3.1 times higher than with lower levels of humidity (<50.0%). Thus, in some regions (e.g., the Southwest), LD is rarely the cause of hospitalizations. In other regions and seasons (e.g., the Mid-Atlantic in summer), LD is much more common. Thus, suspicion for LD should increase when weather is warm and humid. However, when weather is cold, dry, or extremely hot, empirically treating all CAP patients for LD might contribute to excessive antimicrobial drug use at a population level.","L egionellosis is associated with a mild febrile illness, Pontiac fever, or Legionnaires' disease (LD) (1), a cause of severe, atypical, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (2) . Legionella spp. are aerobic, gram-negative bacilli, common in the environment, that were identified as pathogenic after an outbreak of illness among attendees of a 1976 American Legion convention (1, 3) . Although there are several species of Legionella and different serotypes, L. pneumophilia causes most LD cases (4, 5) . The case-fatality rate for LD among community-dwelling persons is as high as 10% (5) . Delayed initiation of appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy further increases death rates (6, 7) , and the severity of LD drives the rationale for covering atypical organisms in the guidelines for empiric treatment of CAP. In developed countries, Legionella causes 1%-4% of CAP cases (4, 8, 9) . Thus, because the rate of LD is low, many persons with CAP may be unnecessarily treated for LD. In fact, a recent noninferiority study, which included aggressive diagnostic testing, showed similar outcomes when treating and not treating for atypical organisms (10) ."

"Infectious MERS-CoV Isolated From a Mildly Ill Patient, Saudi Arabia","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic or mildly ill to severe respiratory illness including death. We describe isolation of infectious MERS-CoV from the upper respiratory tract of a mildly ill 27-year-old female in Saudi Arabia 15 days after illness onset.","Since its emergence in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission has been associated with both direct exposure to dromedary camels [1] and with exposure to markedly symptomatic MERS patients, usually in households or health care settings [2] [3] [4] . Other potential sources of infection are less clear, but unrecognized transmission associated with infected individuals who are mildly ill or asymptomatic has been suspected [5, 6] . Although MERS-CoV RNA has been detected for prolonged periods from respiratory specimens of confirmed patients who were mildly ill or asymptomatic [7] [8] [9] , isolation of live MERS-CoV has not been previously documented among this group."
Respiratory illnesses in Canadian health care workers: a pilot study of influenza vaccine and oseltamivir prophylaxis during the 2007⁄ ⁄ 2008 influenza season,Background Data regarding both rates of acute respiratory illness in health care workers and experience with long-term antiviral prophylaxis are sparse.,"Influenza is a highly communicable disease with annual infection rates in unvaccinated healthy adults ranging from 2% to 23%. [1] [2] [3] Annual influenza vaccine offers the best available protection against influenza, but its effectiveness is limited by poor uptake among some populations (including health care workers), 4-7 by our limited ability to predict influenza evolution and match the vaccine to the infecting strain, 4,5 by limited efficacy of the vaccine in vulnerable populations 8, 9 and by the time required to produce vaccine in the event of a pandemic. 10 Antivirals have also been shown to be efficacious in preventing influenza, 11, 12 but experience with prolonged prophylactic use is limited."
"Docking, virtual high throughput screening and in silico fragment-based drug design • Introduction • Docking -Protein and ligand flexibility -Sampling algorithm -Scoring functions -Performance • Virtual high throughput screening -Ligand-based vHTS -Structure-based vHTS • In silico fragment-based drug design -Theoretical advantages of FBD -Existing FBD methods -Synthetic accessibility of molecules proposed by FBD • Conclusion","The drug discovery process has been profoundly changed recently by the adoption of computational methods helping the design of new drug candidates more rapidly and at lower costs. In silico drug design consists of a collection of tools helping to make rational decisions at the different steps of the drug discovery process, such as the identification of a biomolecular target of therapeutical interest, the selection or the design of new lead compounds and their modification to obtain better affinities, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Among the different tools available, a particular emphasis is placed in this review on molecular docking, virtual high-throughput screening and fragment-based ligand design.","Drug discovery is an interdisciplinary, complex, time consuming and expensive process. It is widely admitted that the pharmaceutical industry now spends far more on research and development but produces fewer new molecules than 20 years ago. The PriceWaterhouseCoopers Pharma report for 2005 stressed that the pharmaceutical industry needs to find means to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery and development. It projected that in silico methods will become a dominant tool to address this issue, from drug discovery to marketing. Recently, advances in computational techniques and hardware have enabled in silico methods to speed up lead identification and optimization. Up till now, these techniques have contributed to the design of about 50 compounds that entered clinical trials, some of which are now FDA approved [1] . As of today, in silico drug design should not be seen as a 'voilà' technique able to suggest directly a small number of compounds with a high affinity and selectivity for the targeted macromolecule, along with favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and using only the three dimensional (3D) structure of the target as a starting point. It rather consists of a systematic use of a wide range of different computational tools aiming, for instance, at improving the knowledge about the target-ligand interactions (molecular docking), increasing the yield of molecules screening by focusing the search on compounds more likely to bind the target (virtual high-throughput screening [vHTS] ) or even suggesting new potential lead compounds (fragment-fragment-based ligand design [FBD] ) [1] . Those methods are detailed below."

Structural basis for receptor recognition by New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses Accession codes The coordinates for the structure of MACV GP1 bound to hTfR1 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 3KAS. HHS Public Access Author manuscript,New World (NW) hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses are rodent-borne agents that cause severe human disease. The GP1 subunit of the surface glycoprotein (GP) mediates cell attachment through transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). We report the structure of Machupo virus (MACV) GP1 bound with human TfR1. Atomic details of the GP1:TfR1 interface clarify the importance of TfR1 residues implicated in NW arenavirus host specificity. Analysis of sequence variation among NW arenavirus GP1s and their host-species receptors in light of the molecular structure indicates determinants of viral zoonotic transmission. Infectivities of pseudoviruses in cells expressing mutated TfR1 confirm that contacts at the tip of the TfR1 apical domain determine the capacity of human TfR1 to mediate infection by particular NW arenaviruses. We propose that NW arenaviruses pathogenic to humans fortuitously acquired affinity for human TfR1 during adaptation to TfR1 of their natural hosts.,"Arenaviruses have enveloped virions and single-stranded, bi-segmented, ambisense RNA genomes 1 . They fall into two groups, the ""Old World"" and ""New World"" (NW) arenaviruses; the latter are further divided into clades A, B, C, and a recombinant A/B clade 2 -4 . Several NW clade B arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fevers when transmitted from their host species to humans. These include the Machupo (MACV), Junín (JUNV), Guanarito (GTOV), and Sabiá (SABV) viruses, the agents of Bolivian, Argentine, Venezuelan, and Brazilian hemorrhagic fevers, respectively, all with high case fatality rates 5 -7 . Chapare virus is a novel NW clade B hemorrhagic fever arenavirus recently isolated in Bolivia 8 ."
In vitro RNA interference targeting the DNA polymerase gene inhibits orf virus replication in primary ovine fetal turbinate cells,"Orf, which is caused by orf virus (ORFV), is distributed worldwide and is endemic in most sheep-and/ or goat-raising countries. RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. In this study, the specific effect of RNAi on the replication of ORFV was explored. The application of RNA interference (RNAi) inhibited the replication of ORFV in cell culture by targeting the ORF025 gene of ORFV, which encodes the viral polymerase. Three small interfering RNA (siRNA) (named siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The siRNAs were evaluated for antiviral activity against the ORFV Jilin isolate by the observation of cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration, and real-time PCR. After 48 h of infection, siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388 reduced virus titers by 59-to 199-fold and reduced the level of viral replication by 73-89 %. These results suggest that these three siRNAs can efficiently inhibit ORFV genome replication and infectious virus production. RNAi targeting of the DNA polymerase gene is therefore potentially useful for studying the replication of ORFV and may have potential therapeutic applications.","Orf, also known as contagious ecthyma or cutaneous pustular dermatitis, is an acute contagious disease of sheep, goats, wild ruminants, and humans worldwide. It is caused by orf virus (ORFV), which is an epitheliotropic parapoxvirus, the prototype member of the genus Parapoxvirus, family Poxviridae [1] . ORFV generally induces proliferative and self-limiting lesions around the mouth, teats and skin of affected animals, especially in young lambs [2] .The mortality rate is as high as 93 % in kids when lesions of the lips and udders prevent them from receiving nutrition, thus leading to rapid emaciation [3, 4] . Outbreaks of orf have occurred in many countries where substantial numbers of sheep and goats are raised [5] . The disease not only causes huge economic losses to the sheep industry but also, as a zoonotic disease, poses a threat to human health [2] ."
Silencing Viral MicroRNA as a Novel Antiviral Therapy?,"Viruses are intracellular parasites that ensure their existence by converting host cells into viral particle producing entities or into hiding places rendering the virus invisible to the host immune system. Some viruses may also survive by transforming the infected cell into an immortal tumour cell. MicroRNAs are small non-coding transcripts that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Viruses encode miRNAs that regulate expression of both cellular and viral genes, and contribute to the pathogenic properties of viruses. Hence, neutralizing the action of viral miRNAs expression by complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides or so-called anti-miRNAs may represent a strategy to combat viral infections and viral-induced pathogenesis. This review describes the miRNAs encoded by human viruses, and discusses the possible therapeutic applications of anti-miRNAs against viral diseases.","Viruses are common habitants of the human population, where they establish different forms of infection, including an acute, a chronic, or a persistent infection with production of low levels of virions. Some viruses can exist in a true latent state in which infectious particles are only produced upon reactivation stimuli. Viruses that reside harmlessly in their host can under certain conditions or in immunocompromised persons be responsible for malignant and nonmalignant diseases, which may even lead to the death of the host. A causal role for human polyomaviruses (HPyV), papillomaviruses (HPV), herpesviruses (HHV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) and cancer is accepted (for recent reviews see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ). It is estimated that oncoviruses are associated with 15% of the human cancers [8] , while nonmalignant infections from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV and HCV alone cause more than 3 million deaths annually worldwide [9] . Other viral infections (HIV no included) were responsible for the death of more than 6000 patients in Japan in 2006, ∼7000 individuals in the USA in 2005, and 555 people in United Kingdom in 2006 according the statistics of the World Health Organization [10] . Thus the pathogenic properties of viruses necessitate the development of efficient antiviral therapies."
Changes in expression of cellular oncogenes and endogenous retrovirus- like sequences during hepatocarcinogenesis induced by a peroxisome proliferator,"Previous studies have demonstrated that BR-931, a hepatic peroxisome proliferator, can induce liver tumours in mice and rats. Since alterations in gene expression may play a critical role in multistage hepatocarcinogenesis, the present studies examined the expression of the c-myc, c-H-ras, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) genes, as well as endogenous retrovirus-like sequences, in F344 rat liver during the first 8 weeks of feeding a 0.16% Br931 diet and in liver tumours induced by chronic feeding of this diet. Northern blot analysis of poly A+ liver RNA samples showed an increase in the level of RNAs homologous to rat leukaemia virus (RaLV) but no significant change in the level of 30S-retrovirus related RNAs in the liver RNA samples obtained from rats during the first 8 weeks of feeding the diet containing BR931. An increase in the levels of c-myc, c-H-ras and ODC transcripts was also seen in the liver RNA samples from the treated rats. Of particular interest was a decrease in the abundance of EGF receptor transcripts in the liver RNA samples from rats fed the BR931 diet. Increased levels of RaLV, c-myc, and ODC RNAs were also seen in the tumours induced by BR931, but this was not the case for 30S and c-H-ras. The liver tumour samples also showed a decrease in EGF receptor RNA. These changes in cellular levels of specific RNAs resemble, in several respect, those we previously described in rodent liver during regeneration and tumour promotion, and also those seen in rodent hepatomas induced by other agents. Therefore, they may reflect a common profile of gene expression relevant to liver proliferation and carcinogenesis.","Changes in expression of cellular oncogenes and endogenous retroviruslike sequences during hepatocarcinogenesis induced by a peroxisome proliferator L.L.

The New Global Health PERSPECTIVE,"The term global health has replaced tropical medicine and international health, disciplines linked to the history of colonialism, the post-independence era of the former European colonies, and the experience of development assistance (2,3). Global health is multidisciplinary, encompasses many elements besides development, and requires coordination of multiple parties, rather than direction by one organization or discipline. The increased technical and","Global health reflects the realities of globalization, including worldwide dissemination of infectious and noninfectious public health risks. Global health architecture is complex and better coordination is needed between multiple organizations. Three overlapping themes determine global health action and prioritization: development, security, and public health. These themes play out against a background of demographic change, socioeconomic development, and urbanization. Infectious diseases remain critical factors, but are no longer the major cause of global illness and death. Traditional indicators of public health, such as maternal and infant mortality rates no longer describe the health status of whole societies; this change highlights the need for investment in vital registration and disease-specific reporting. Noncommunicable diseases, injuries, and mental health will require greater attention from the world in the future. The new global health requires broader engagement by health organizations and all countries for the objectives of health equity, access, and coverage as priorities beyond the Millennium Development Goals are set."
Clinical and Epidemiologic Characterization of WU Polyomavirus Infection,"WU polyomavirus is a recently described polyomavirus found in patients with respiratory infections. Of 2,637 respiratory samples tested in St. Louis, Missouri, 2.7% were positive for WU polyomavirus by PCR, and 71% were coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Persistent human infection with WU polyomavirus is described.","A n initial report described the identifi cation of WU polyomavirus in 6 (0.7%) of 890 respiratory tract samples collected in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, and in 37 (3.0%) of 1,245 respiratory tract specimens tested from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (1) . The goal of our study was to extend these initial fi ndings by determining the prevalence of WU polyomavirus in a larger patient cohort in St. Louis."
Virus-Specific Read-Through Codon Preference Affects Infectivity of Chimeric Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Viruses Displaying a Dengue Virus Epitope,"A Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 (EB4). The EB4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.","The development of plant virus vectors as in planta expression systems for foreign genes provides an attractive alternative biotechnological approach for peptide expression [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This method has been exploited in vaccine production, where small foreign peptides are expressed as a fusion with the viral coat proteins. Essentially, an insertion site has to be determined in the virus genome so that the resulting product will be displayed on the surface of the virus particle which is then propagated in plants and consequently isolated and used as antigen presenting vehicles [5, 6] . Modifications that do not interfere with the normal functions of the particular virus are a prerequisite for this peptide fusion approach. One strategy suggests that foreign gene segments could be fused to the terminus of a viral gene in a way that permits the production of both the fusion product and the native viral protein, thus avoiding interference with normal gene functions. The success of this epitope presentation strategy depends on a detailed knowledge of virus structure at the atomic level, which is only available for a limited number of viruses."
"Possibilities, Intentions and Threats: Dual Use in the Life Sciences Reconsidered Koos van der Bruggen",Due to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the anthrax letters,"Dual use is not a concept that is unique for the life sciences. The (possibility of) dual use is as old as engineering and designing. Literally dual use means nothing more and nothing less than that a certain activity or a certain object can be applied in at least two ways. This is the case with almost everything that has been designed or developed, but also with objects that are not human made, like natural herbs. To give some examples: a kitchen knife can be used to cut, but also sometimes as an alternative for a screw driver and indeed also to stab someone. 1 Palliative pills are meant to alleviate pain, but if someone takes enough of these pills they can be used for committing suicide. This list can be continued endlessly. Almost every artefact and many natural products can be applied in a dual or even multiple use way. The dual or multiple ways an artefact can be used are not always intended by the designer. A screwdriver is not designed to stab a person. In pharmaceutical research unexpected or unintended effects of medicines also can lead to dual use. Sometimes the original function even is displaced by the unintended one. A well-known example is the Viagra pill. This pill had been designed against angina pectoris, but is now used for almost 100% to solve erection problems."
Yeast and the AIDS Virus: The Odd Couple,"Despite being simple eukaryotic organisms, the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have been widely used as a model to study human pathologies and the replication of human, animal, and plant viruses, as well as the function of individual viral proteins. The complete genome of S. cerevisiae was the first of eukaryotic origin to be sequenced and contains about 6,000 genes. More than 75% of the genes have an assigned function, while more than 40% share conserved sequences with known or predicted human genes. This strong homology has allowed the function of human orthologs to be unveiled starting from the data obtained in yeast. RNA plant viruses were the first to be studied in yeast. In this paper, we focus on the use of the yeast model to study the function of the proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the search for its cellular partners. This human retrovirus is the cause of AIDS. The WHO estimates that there are 33.4 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS, with 2.7 million new HIV infections per year and 2.0 million annual deaths due to AIDS. Current therapy is able to control the disease but there is no permanent cure or a vaccine. By using yeast, it is possible to dissect the function of some HIV-1 proteins and discover new cellular factors common to this simple cell and humans that may become potential therapeutic targets, leading to a long-lasting treatment for AIDS.","Since the genetics and cell biology of higher eukaryotes are extremely complex, scientists looking for a good model have turned to the use of yeast as a simpler system for the study of various pathologies including virus proliferation and assay new drugs against these pathogenic agents."
Vaccines for the future: learning from human immunology,"Conventional vaccines have been extremely successful in preventing infections by pathogens expressing relatively conserved antigens through antibodymediated effector mechanisms. Thanks to vaccination some diseases have been eradicated and mortality due to infectious diseases has been significantly reduced. However, there are still many infections that are not preventable with vaccination, which represent a major cause of mortality worldwide. Some of these infections are caused by pathogens with a high degree of antigen variability that cannot be controlled only by antibodies, but require a mix of humoral and cellular immune responses. Novel technologies for antigen discovery, expression and formulation allow now for the development of vaccines that can better cope with pathogen diversity and trigger multifunctional immune responses. In addition, the application of new genomic assays and systems biology approaches in human immunology can help to better identify vaccine correlates of protection. The availability of novel vaccine technologies, together with the knowledge of the distinct human immune responses that are required to prevent different types of infection, should help to rationally design effective vaccines where conventional approaches have failed.","Vaccination has been one of the most effective measures to control infectious diseases in the 20th century. It is believed that vaccination saves 2-3 million lives per year globally. Smallpox has been eradicated worldwide and polio is almost eliminated. Most of the viral (Mumps, Rubella, Measles, Varicella and Rotavirus) and bacterial (Tetanus, Diphteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Meningococcus group C) diseases traditionally affecting childhood all over the world are now preventable with vaccines (GIVS 2006 (GIVS -2015 . Besides paediatric and adult population, vaccination has been successfully extended to adolescents, elderly, immunocompromised subjects and pregnant women. Although therapeutic vaccines targeting ongoing chronic infectious diseases have not yet been developed, effective vaccines exist that prevent chronic infections by human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), which in some cases cause cancer. In summary vaccination has been -and continues to represent -a success story (Plotkin et al., 2008; Levine et al., 2009) . However, there is still a long list of viruses [e.g. hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Dengue, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)]; parasites (e.g. Plasmodium, Leishmania, Schistosoma, Trypanosoma) and bacteria [e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), Group A streptococcus (GAS), Group B Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Meningococcus Group B (MenB), Shigella, pathogenic Escherichia coli] that are not preventable by vaccination, and infectious diseases are still a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Thirtythree million people are currently infected by HIV that causes 1.8 million deaths per year (WHO Global summary of AIDS epidemic: http://www.unaids.org/globalreport). Malaria and tuberculosis together kill almost 3 million people every year (WHO report 2010: http://www.who.int). The total number of deaths increases even more if we include those caused by vaccine preventable infections in areas of the world where vaccines are not available to the population. It is estimated that over 2.5 million of children under 5 years of age die every year as a result of vaccine preventable infections (GIVS 2006 (GIVS -2015 . In the future, the increased availability of existing vaccines and the development of new vaccines can have a tremendous impact in reducing the mortality and disability caused by infectious diseases worldwide."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Lessons from Singapore,"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Singapore in March 2003. To illustrate the problems in diagnosing and containing SARS in the hospital, we describe a case series and highlight changes in triage and infection control practices that have resulted. By implementing these changes, we have stopped the nosocomial transmission of the virus.","A n outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in Singapore on March 12, 2003. The index patient was hospitalized at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which has since become the country's designated SARS hospital. The patient infected 20 other people (including patients and healthcare workers), who subsequently became the sources for secondary spread of the infection (1) . As of June 12, 2003, a total of 206 cases and 31 deaths attributed to SARS had been reported in Singapore."
Mutational analysis of human CEACAM1: the potential of receptor polymorphism in increasing host susceptibility to bacterial infection,"is targeted by several important human respiratory pathogens. These include Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter-and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAMbinding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.","The bacterial pathogens Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) are frequently found in the nasopharynx of a substantial proportion of the healthy population but are capable of causing serious infections in susceptible individuals (Turk, 1984; Foxwell et al., 1998) . Nm and typable Hi (THi) can invade the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier to cause septicaemia and meningitis, which in the case of Nm, may rapidly become life threatening (van Deuren et al., 2000) . Non-typable Hi (NTHi), which lack a polysaccharide capsule, are associated with localized respiratory tract and conjunctival infections (Foxwell et al., 1998) . Strains belonging to Hi-biogroup aegyptius (Hi-aeg) are also associated with Brazilian purpuric fever (Foxwell et al., 1998) . The factors that determine susceptibility to infection by these frequent colonizers are not entirely clear."
Replicative Capacity of MERS Coronavirus in Livestock Cell Lines,Replicative capacity of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was assessed in cell lines derived from livestock and peridomestic small mammals on the Arabian Peninsula. Only cell lines originating from goats and camels showed efficient replication of MERS-CoV. These results provide direction in the search for the intermediate host of MERS-CoV.,"and representative peridomestic small mammals on the Arabian Peninsula. To estimate MERS-CoV permissiveness of cell cultures derived from these animals, we compared MERS-CoV replication and infectious virus production with that in bat-and primate-derived cells known to be permissive for MERS-CoV. The MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is expressed in epithelial cells of the lung and kidney, and patients with MERS-CoV consistently show severe involvement of both organs; thus, we focused on lung and kidney cells in potential animal hosts (10, 11) ."
Human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus: subtle differences but comparable severity,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered virus that causes respiratory illness in children that can lead to hospitalization. Our study was undertaken to further understand hMPV-associated illness, compare clinical characteristics of hMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and establish the utility of routine screening for hMPV. We retrospectively identified hMPV-associated illnesses described among children with respiratory symptoms admitted to a tertiary care center in southeast Michigan during the 2006-2007 respiratory viral season. A convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal specimens was subjected to nucleic acid extraction and amplification to identify those specimens positive for hMPV. A medical record review was undertaken to retrieve demographic and clinical data of patients with hMPV, comparing them to RSVpositive patients and patients evaluated for respiratory symptoms who were negative for hMPV and RSV. We found that hMPV was the second most commonly identified virus after RSV. hMPV-positive patients were older than RSV-positive patients. Among hMPV-positive patients, pneumonia was diagnosed in 37.5% and bronchiolitis in 31.2%, peribronchial cuffing was present on chest radiographs of 37.5%, antibiotic treatment was used in 81.2%, and admission to the ICU was seen in 37.5%. Finally, hMPV-positive patients were more likely to have fever than RSV-positive patients or patients negative for hMPV and RSV. We concluded that hMPV is a major pathogen associated with hospitalization of children and with the same severity of illness as RSV but in a slightly older population.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It has been implicated as a significant cause of hospitalization for young children, 1 second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). 15 hMPV has been detected in 1.5-43.0% of patients with ARIs. 5 While it circulates predominantly in the winter, infections have been reported year-round [16] [17] [18] and the incidence varies yearly. 5, [18] [19] [20] [21] Seroprevalence studies have shown that almost all children over five years of age have evidence of past infection. 22 Past infection with hMPV is thought to confer only partial immunity to subsequent infections. 2, 13, 14 Clinical syndromes associated with hMPV infection are similar to those of RSV infection, 4, 23 ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections to wheezing and severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring mechanical ventilation. 2, 11, [23] [24] [25] [26] Rare cases of fatalities have been associated with hMPV 11, [27] [28] [29] [30] and it has been implicated in a handful of cases of encephalitis. 12, 31, 32 Although hMPV infections have been diagnosed in adults, their greatest impact occurs in children. 33 A significant association with hMPV and wheezing is seen in young children, 23, 34, 35 and hMPV has been linked to apparent life-threatening events in infants. 25 hMPV has been associated with ARIs with super-infections as a result of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 2 To begin to understand the impact of hMPV on our institution, we analyzed children admitted to our tertiary care center in southeast Michigan with respiratory symptoms during the respiratory season of 2006-2007 through an observational, retrospective study. The primary purposes of our study were to establish the utility of testing for hMPV in children who were admitted to our hospital during the respiratory virus season and to compare the impact of hMPV and RSV on the healthcare system."
,"WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) was detected in a bone marrow transplant recipient with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome who died in 2001. Crystalline lattices of polyomaviruslike particles were observed in the patient's lung by electron microscopy. WUPyV was detected in the lung and other tissues by real-time quantitative PCR and identified in the lung and trachea by immunohistochemistry. A subset of WUPyVpositive cells in the lung had morphologic features of macrophages. Although the role of WUPyV as a human pathogen remains unclear, these results clearly demonstrate evidence for infection of respiratory tract tissues in this patient.","P olyomaviruses are small, circular, double-stranded DNA viruses. Infection with BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) or JC polyomavirus causes substantial illness and death in immunocompromised populations, including transplant recipients and HIV patients (1) . Infection with either virus is typically asymptomatic unless the host is immunocompromised. Since 2007, a total of 11 additional human polyomaviruses have been discovered. Two of these viruses (Merkel cell carcinoma polyomavirus and trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus) have also been implicated as human pathogens in the context of immunosuppression (2, 3) ; the former causes Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare but aggressive skin cancer (3) , and the latter is associated with trichodysplasia spinulosa, a rare skin disease seen in transplant recipients (2) . Several of the other new human polyomaviruses (e.g., human polyomavirus 9 and New Jersey polyomavirus) were also initially identified in immunocompromised patients (4, 5) ."
Activity of sputum p38 MAPK is correlated with airway inflammation and reduced FEV 1 in COPD patients,Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants of the progression and severity of COPD. The present study explored the correlation between sputum p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, affects approximately 210 million people worldwide and is currently a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] . Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants for the progression and severity of COPD, as defined by the decline in FEV 1 [5] . The airway inflammation in COPD is generally described as neutrophilic. Several immune cells, proinflammatory chemokines, and cytokines extensively participate in the induction and maintenance of the inflammatory response in the airway [6] . The chemokine CXCL8 (also referred to as interleukin-8), which is secreted from the leukocytic cells (monocytes, T cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and other cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts [7] , has a well documented role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of airway inflammation in COPD."
Immune pathways and defence mechanisms in honey bees Apis mellifera,"Here we focus on individual defences, by presenting a genome-wide analysis of immunity in a social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera . We present honey bee models for each of four signalling pathways associated with immunity, identifying plausible orthologues for nearly all predicted pathway members. When compared to the sequenced Drosophila and Anopheles genomes, honey bees possess roughly one-third as many genes in 17 gene families implicated in insect immunity. We suggest that an implied reduction in immune flexibility in bees reflects either the strength of social barriers to disease, or a tendency for bees to be attacked by a limited set of highly coevolved pathogens.","While evident in social organisms ranging from humans to birds (Brown & Brown, 2004; Masuda et al ., 2004) , the impacts of sociality on disease are especially vivid within social insect colonies. Here, typically thousands of individuals interact in close quarters, at densities far exceeding those of even the most crowded vertebrate social groups (Wilson, 1971) . This density, coupled with a relatively homeostatic nest environment and the presence of stored resources, makes social insects attractive targets for disease agents (Schmid-Hempel, 1998) . As expected based on their parasite and pathogen pressures, social insects have evolved both individual and group strategies to combat disease. Grooming, nest hygiene and other behavioural traits found throughout the social insects can reduce the impacts of pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasitic mites. For example, 'hygienic behaviour' first described for honey bees (Rothenbuhler, 1964) is now a classical example of a social defence, whereby workers identify and remove infected larvae from among the healthy brood (Spivak & Reuter, 2001) . Other defences enabled by sociality include the construction of nests from antimicrobial materials (Christe et al ., 2003) , the raising of offspring in sterile nurseries (Burgett, 1997) , social 'fever' in response to disease (Starks et al ., 2000) , transference of immune traits (Traniello et al ., 2002; Sadd et al ., 2005) , and heightened risk-taking by infected individuals (Schmid-Hempel, 2005) . Like most eukaryotes, colony members also possess individual defences, including immune responses toward disease agents (Casteels-Josson et al ., 1994; Evans, 2004) . The recent sequencing of the honey bee genome (Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2006) allows the first global analysis of immune components in honey bees, and the second opportunity (after humans) to use genomic insights to better understand disease resistance in a highly social organism."
"Available from: Public Health Law Program, Public Health Practice Program Office","Law, which is a fundamental element of effective public health policy and practice, played a crucial role in many of public health's greatest achievements of the 20th century. Still, conceptual legal frameworks for the systematic application of law to chronic disease prevention and control have not been fully recognized and used to address public health needs. Development and implementation of legal frameworks could broaden the range of effective public health strategies and provide valuable tools for the public health workforce, especially for state and local health department program managers and state and national policy makers. In an effort to expand the range of effective public health interventions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will work with its partners to explore the development of systematic legal frameworks as a tool for preventing chronic diseases and addressing the growing epidemic of obesity, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases and their risk factors.","This paper examines the potential need for and role of systematic legal frameworks in preventing and mitigating chronic diseases. In part 1 of this 2-part series, we describe the role and use of laws, as well as the demonstrated effectiveness of laws, in supporting selected public health interventions. In part 2, we will provide an overview of U.S. jurisprudence and legal methods relevant to public health problems and outline potential contours of legal frameworks adaptable to chronic disease prevention by offering examples from different public health domains."
,"Developing effective and safe vaccines is urgently needed to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine may be the first one available for clinical use because it is easy to generate; however, safety is the main concern. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit of S protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes. This suggests that recombinant proteins containing RBD and vectors encoding the RBD sequence can be used to develop safe and effective SARS vaccines.","safe vaccines is urgently needed to prevent a new SARS epidemic and for biodefense preparedness. Currently, 3 major classes of SARS vaccines are under development: 1) inactivated SARS-CoV (Figure 1 ), 2) full-length S protein (Figure 2A) , and 3) those based on fragments containing neutralizing epitopes ( Figure 2B )."

Community-based surveillance and control interventions have been heavily promoted but the most effective interventions have not been identified.,"The 2004 WHO/FAO/OIE joint consultation on emerging zoonotic diseases defined such diseases as, ""a zoonosis that is newly recognized or newly evolved, or that has occurred previously but shows an increase in incidence or expansion in geographical, host or vector range"". 1 Avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus, monkeypox, Hendra virus, and the lentiviruses that cause Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are a few examples of the growing number of diseases that humans can contract from animals."
Identification of pathogens and virulence profile of Rhodococcus equi and Escherichia coli strains obtained from sand of parks,"The identification of pathogens of viral (Rotavirus, Coronavirus), parasitic (Toxocara spp.) and bacterial (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Rhodococcus equi) origin shed in feces, and the virulence profile of R. equi and E. coli isolates were investigated in 200 samples of sand obtained from 40 parks, located in central region of state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, using different diagnostic methods. From 200 samples analyzed, 23 (11.5%) strains of R. equi were isolated. None of the R. equi isolates showed a virulent (vapA gene) or intermediately virulent (vapB gene) profiles. Sixty-three (31.5%) strains of E. coli were identified. The following genes encoding virulence factors were identified in E. coli: eae, bfp, saa, iucD, papGI, sfa and hly. Phylogenetic classification showed that 63 E. coli isolates belonged to groups B1 (52.4%), A (25.4%) and B2 (22.2%). No E. coli serotype O157:H7 was identified. Eggs of Toxocara sp. were found in three parks and genetic material of bovine Coronavirus was identified in one sample of one park. No Salmonella spp. and Rotavirus isolates were identified in the samples of sand. The presence of R. equi, Toxocara sp, bovine Coronavirus and virulent E. coli isolates in the environment of parks indicates that the sanitary conditions of the sand should be improved in order to reduce the risks of fecal transmission of pathogens of zoonotic potential to humans in these places.","Enteric pathogens are a major group of organisms related to infections in humans and animals. These pathogens are resistant to adverse environmental conditions and are frequently transmitted by oral route due to fecal contamina-risks posed by microorganisms eliminated in feces of animals favor the transmission of pathogens of animal origin to humans in these places (Matsuo and Nakashio, 2005) ."

Capacity of Thailand to Contain an Emerging Infl uenza Pandemic,"Southeast Asia will likely be the epicenter of the next infl uenza pandemic. To determine whether health system resources in Thailand are suffi cient to contain an emerging pandemic, we mapped health system resources in 76 provinces. We used 3 prepandemic scenarios of clustered cases and determined resource needs, availability, and gaps. We extended this analysis to a scenario of a modest pandemic and assumed that the same standards of clinical care would be required. We found that gaps exist in many resource categories, even under scenarios in which few cases occur. Such gaps are likely to be profound if a severe pandemic occurs. These gaps exist in infrastructure, personnel and materials, and surveillance capacity. Policy makers must determine whether such resource gaps can realistically be closed, ideally before a pandemic occurs. Alternatively, explicit assumptions must be made regarding allocation of scarce resources, standards of care, and priority setting during a pandemic.","T he World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted how the Asia-Pacifi c region has been an important center of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian infl uenza. Since 2003 (as of September 10, 2008), 15 countries have experienced human cases of infection with infl uenza virus A subtype H5N1 (1), and subtype H5N1 infection is now endemic in poultry in several countries. The H5N1 subtype continues to pose an important public health threat in both the short term and the long term. Southeast Asia remains a likely region from which future emerging infectious diseases, including the next infl uenza pandemic, are likely to emerge (2, 3) ."
2′-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members HHS Public Access,"Cellular mRNA of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNA are methylated at the N-7 and 2′-O positions of the 5′ guanosine cap by specific nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1, the function of 2′-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago 2-4. Here, we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2′-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. 2′-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNVinfected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2′-O MTase Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:","activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2′-O methylation of the 5′ cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2′-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from nonself RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA likely serves as a paradigm for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells."
"Topology Engineering of Proteins in Vivo Using Genetically Encoded, Mechanically Interlocking SpyX Modules for Enhanced Stability","Recombinant proteins are traditionally limited to linear configuration. Herein, we report in vivo protein topology engineering using highly efficient, mechanically interlocking SpyX modules named AXB and BXA. SpyX modules are protein domains composed of p53dim (X), SpyTag (A), and SpyCatcher (B). The p53dim guides the intertwining of the two nascent protein chains followed by autocatalytic isopeptide bond formation between SpyTag and SpyCatcher to fulfill the interlocking, leading to a variety of backbone topologies. Direct expression of AXB or BXA produces protein catenanes with distinct ring sizes. Recombinant proteins containing SpyX modules are obtained either as mechanically interlocked obligate dimers if the protein of interest is fused to the N-or C-terminus of SpyX modules, or as star proteins if the protein is fused to both N-and C-termini. As examples, cellular syntheses of dimers of (GB1) 2 (where GB1 stands for immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G) and of four-arm elastin-like star proteins were demonstrated. Comparison of the catenation efficiencies in different constructs reveals that BXA is generally much more effective than AXB, which is rationalized by the arrangement of three domains in space. Mechanical interlocking induces considerable stability enhancement. Both AXB and BXA have a melting point ∼20°C higher than the linear controls and the BXA catenane has a melting point~2°C higher than the cyclic control BX'A. Notably, four-arm elastin-like star proteins demonstrate remarkable tolerance against trypsin digestion. The SpyX modules provide a convenient and versatile approach to construct unconventional protein topologies via the ""assembly-reaction"" synergy, which opens a new horizon in protein science for stability enhancement and function reinforcement via topology engineering.","In synthetic polymers, chain topology and molecular architecture have been important molecular parameters to tune their physical properties and functions. 1−3 Controlling macromolecular topology is thus one of the most commonly practiced molecular engineering approaches. 4, 5 To a certain extent, it compensates for the lack of sequence control in traditional polymers. An extraordinary example is the star polymer, which emerged back in the early days of polymer science. 3 Multiple polymer chains emanating from a central focal point constitute the basic structure of star polymers. 6 This unique topology imparts intriguing properties to star polymers, including low viscosity, multiple surface functional groups, low crystallinity, etc. 7, 8 Nowadays, synthetic star polymers can be prepared with delicate control over the arm number, arm composition, molecular weight, polydispersity, etc. 7 Sophisticated architectures with heterogeneous compositions are not uncommon. 9, 10 By contrast, recombinant proteins are usually synthesized by the cellular machinery in an extremely precise fashion. 11 The stereochemistry, sequence, chain length, and even 3D folded structure are all determined on the genetic level and faithfully reproduced in the biological system. The topology is, however, usually restrained to linear configuration. To date, there are only a few examples of nonlinear proteins, including cyclic proteins, tadpoles, stars, H-shape proteins, and catenanes, 12 ,13 yet its full potential remains to be explored. It is thus highly desired to further expand the topological dimension for protein engineering."
SARS epi-demiology and cumulative case curve,"LETTERS that the quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of public health intervention measures for SARS is a difficult task for modelers. To make models useful for assessing the effects of specific intervention measures and for predicting the future dynamics during an ongoing epidemic, we need improved knowledge on the transmission mechanisms, pathogenesis, and the epidemiologic determinants of the spread of the virus. Any retrospective analysis of the 2003 SARS epidemic that improves our knowledge of SARS epidemiology is welcome.","To the Editor: A novel coronavirus caused more than 8,000 proba-ble cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide (1, 2) during the 2003 outbreak. Before the etiologic agent was identified, the diagnosis of SARS was made according to a set of clinical-epidemiologic criteria as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1-3). These criteria remained important in the initial diagnosis and prompt isolation of patients because the overall sensitivity of initial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS CoV) RNA on upper respiratory specimens ranged from approximately 60% to 70% (though sensitivity improved with a second test) (4, 5) . In a SARS screening clinic at the Prince of Wales emergency department, the positive predictive value (PPV) of these criteria was estimated to be 54% (95% CI 39% to 69%) (6) . The relative importance of the clinical versus epidemiologic criteria had not been evaluated. By using paired serologic testing to determine SARS-CoV infection (3), we evaluated the relative importance of the clinical-epidemiologic diagnostic criteria during an outbreak."
DRUGS IN CONTEXT RIGOROUS • RAPID • RESPONSIVE REVIEW,Background: Febrile seizures are the most common neurologic disorder in childhood. Physicians should be familiar with the proper evaluation and management of this common condition.,"Febrile seizures are generally defined as seizures occurring in children typically 6 months to 5 years of age in association with a fever greater than 38°C (100.4°F), who do not have evidence of an intracranial cause (e.g. infection, head trauma, and epilepsy), another definable cause of seizure (e.g. electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, drug use, or drug withdrawal), or a history of an afebrile seizure. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Febrile seizure is a major challenge in pediatric practice because of its high incidence in young children and its tendency to recur. In recent years, there has been more awareness about the potential complications of febrile seizures and management of this condition. Updated guidelines for the evaluation and management of febrile seizures were published by the American Academy of Pediatrics Europe with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months. 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Although febrile seizure is seen in all ethnic groups, it is more frequently seen in the Asian population (5-10% of Indian children and 6-9% of Japanese children). 13 The incidence is as high as 14% in Guamese. 14 The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.6 to 1. 8, 10, 11, 15 The condition is more common in children belonging to a lower socioeconomic status, presumably because of inadequate access to medical care. 8 Seasonal and diurnal variations in the occurrence of febrile seizures have been observed by investigators in the United States, Finland, and Japan. [16] [17] [18] [19] Basically, the majority of febrile seizures occur in the winter months and in the afternoon. [16] [17] [18] [19] Etiology and pathogenesis"
What is new in otitis media?,"The ""wait and see"" approach in acute otitis media (AOM), consisting of postponing the antibiotic administration for a few days, has been advocated mainly to counteract the increased bacterial resistance in respiratory infections. This approach is not justified in children less than 2 years of age and this for several reasons. First, AOM is an acute inflammation of the middle ear caused in about 70% of cases by bacteria. Redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane are characteristic findings in bacterial AOM. Second, AOM is associated with long-term dysfunction of the inflamed eustachian tube (ET), particularly in children less than 2 years of age. In this age group, the small calibre of the ET together with its horizontal direction result in impaired clearance, ventilation and protection of the middle ear. Third, recent prospective studies have shown poor long-term prognosis of AOM in children below 2 years with at least 50% of recurrences and persisting otitis media with effusion (OME) in about 35% 6 months after AOM. Viruses elicit AOM in about 30% of children. A prolonged course of AOM has been observed when bacterial and viral infections are combined because viral infection is also associated with ET dysfunction in young children. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is an excellent tool both for initial treatment and recurrence of AOM. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is mandatory in children less than 2 years of age to decrease inflammation in the middle ear but also of the ET particularly during the first episode. The best choice is amoxicillin because of its superior penetration in the middle ear. Streptococci pneumoniae with intermediary bacterial resistance to penicillin are particularly associated with recurrent AOM. Therefore the dosage of amoxicillin should be 90 mg/kg per day in three doses. In recurrent AOM with β-lactamase-producing bacilli, amoxicillin should be associated with clavulanic acid at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg per day. The duration of the treatment is not established yet but 10 days is reasonable for a first episode of AOM. OME may be a precursor initiating AOM but also a complication thereof. OME needs a watchful waiting approach. When associated with deafness for 2-3 months in children over 2 years of age, an antibiotic should be given according to the results of the bacterial resistance in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The high rate of complications of tympanostomy tube insertion outweighs the beneficial effect on hearing loss. The poor results of this procedure are due to the absence of effects on ET dysfunction. Pneumococcal vaccination has little beneficial effects on recurrent AOM and its use in infants needs further studies. Treatment with amoxicillin is indicated in all children younger than 2 years with a first episode of AOM presenting with redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane. Combined amoxicillin and clavulanic acid should be given in patients with βlactamase-producing bacteria. The duration of treatment is estimated to be at least 10 days depending on the findings by pneumo-otoscopy and tympanometry. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is highly recommended particularly in children in day care centres as well as for regular follow-up. The high recurrence rate is due to the long-lasting dysfunction of the eustachian tube and the immune immaturity of children less than 2 years of age.","Abstract The ""wait and see"" approach in acute otitis media (AOM), consisting of postponing the antibiotic administration for a few days, has been advocated mainly to counteract the increased bacterial resistance in respiratory infections.

,"We analyzed hospital records to provide a populationbased estimate of zygomycosis incidence and trends over a 10-year period at a national level in France. Data showed an increasing incidence from 0.7/million in 1997 to 1.2/million in 2006 (p<0.001). We compared our data with those from the French Mycosis Study Group, a recently established voluntary network of French mycologists coordinated by the National Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungals. We documented that incidence of zygomycosis increased, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies or bone marrow transplants. The role of previous exposure to antifungal drugs lacking activity against zygomycetes could explain this increase but does not appear exclusive. Incidence also increased in the population of patients with diabetes mellitus. We conclude that observed trends reflect a genuine increase of zygomycosis cases in at-risk populations.","Z ygomycoses are severe angioinvasive infections caused by common filamentous fungi, the zygomycetes. These ubiquitous opportunistic fungi can cause infections with high lethality in immunocompromised or diabetic patients. Whatever the route of infection (inhalation of airborne spores, ingestion, or direct skin inoculation), the hyphae invade blood vessels, causing tissue infarction and necrosis (1) (2) (3) (4) . In healthy persons, innate immunity is sufficient to prevent infection, except in cases of massive contamination after traumatic inoculation of contaminated soil (5) . Patients with phagocytic dysfunctions caused by neutrope-nia or ketoacidosis, as well as patients with high iron serum concentrations, are at high risk of developing zygomycosis (4) . These underlying conditions can influence clinical presentation and outcome (2, 6, 7) . The rhinocerebral presentation is the most frequently reported localized symptom followed by pulmonary, cutaneous, cerebral, gastrointestinal, and disseminated infections (3, 8) . In the rhinocerebral or pulmonary forms, patient death rates are reported to be as high as 60% because of delayed diagnosis or delayed therapeutic management (7) (8) (9) . Treatment strategies are based on high doses of any lipid formulation of amphotericin B, associated with large surgical resections when possible. Most triazole agents are not effective in vivo (10) , except for posaconazole, which shows some efficacy both experimentally and in patients as second-line therapy (11) (12) (13) . The clinical contribution of new iron chelating agents remains controversial (14, 15) ."
"Infection Control and SARS Transmission among Healthcare Workers, Taiwan","This study found infrequent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to healthcare workers involved in the care of the first five casepatients in Taiwan, despite a substantial number of unprotected exposures. Nonetheless, given that SARS has been highly transmissible on some occasions, we still recommend strict precautions.","H ealthcare workers may be unwittingly exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from patients with pneumonia at the onset of an epidemic (1, 2) . They are also at increased risk of acquiring SARS from known case-patients with a high viral load who require intensive respiratory care (1) (2) (3) . The first case-patient in Taiwan was admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital on March 8, 2003 , before the World Health Organization (WHO) issued the first global alert (4, 5) . The patient was intubated in the emergency room and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The second case-patient, his wife, was admitted to the emergency room with pneumonia on March 14. The occurrence of two cases of pneumonia in the same household within 6 days, together with the patients' recent travel to Guangdong, China, through Hong Kong, led us to suspect a diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, which later came to be known as SARS."
Quantitative Temporal in Vivo Proteomics Deciphers the Transition of Virus-Driven Myeloid Cells into M2 Macrophages,"Myeloid cells play a central role in the context of viral eradication, yet precisely how these cells differentiate throughout the course of acute infections is poorly understood. In this study, we have developed a novel quantitative temporal in vivo proteomics (QTiPs) platform to capture proteomic signatures of temporally transitioning virus-driven myeloid cells directly in situ, thus taking into consideration host−virus interactions throughout the course of an infection. QTiPs, in combination with phenotypic, functional, and metabolic analyses, elucidated a pivotal role for inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high-low cells in antiviral immune response and viral clearance. Most importantly, the time-resolved QTiPs data set showed the transition of CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C high-low cells into M2-like macrophages, which displayed increased antigen-presentation capacities and bioenergetic demands late in infection. We elucidated the pivotal role of myeloid cells in virus clearance and show how these cells phenotypically, functionally, and metabolically undergo a timely transition from inflammatory to M2-like macrophages in vivo. With respect to the growing appreciation for in vivo examination of viral−host interactions and for the role of myeloid cells, this study elucidates the use of quantitative proteomics to reveal the role and response of distinct immune cell populations throughout the course of virus infection.","Myeloid immune cell populations are phenotypically dynamic and arise from a common pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell lineage. Following infection, bone marrow (BM)-emigrating immature monocytic myeloid cellsidentified in mice as CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C + cellsare recruited to the site of infection and mediate antimicrobial, as well as inflammatory, functions. Importantly, site-specific environmental cues dictate the functionality and cellular phenotype of these myeloid cells, ranging from pro-inflammatory to immunosuppressive. It is hypothesized that, through a temporal transition, these inflammatory immature myeloid cells differentiate into monocytes and macrophages that acquire specific phenotypes, functionalities, and metabolic profiles throughout infection. Such plasticity permits these myeloid cells to be associated with a plethora of pathological conditions including pathogenic infections, 1−3 inflammatory diseases/responses, 4,5 cancer progression, 6−9 and antitumor immune responses. 10 Following infection, recruitment and transition of inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6C + cells are instrumental in L. monocytogenes, 2 K. pneumoniae, 1 and influenza virus clearance. 11 Although the exact mechanism of how inflammatory CD11b + , Ly6G − , Ly6C + cells contribute to pathogenic clearance is unclear, it is apparent that these cells are pivotal in both innate immunity as well as adaptive immunity. 1, 12 Thus, an in depth examination of their transitory, temporal, and stage-specific phenotype is necessary to understand the role and function of virus-driven inflammatory myeloid cells."
Evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions using dextran-and mannan-dextran-coated USPIO: MRI analysis and pathological findings,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect atherosclerotic lesions containing accumulations of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO). Positing that improved USPIO with a higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would yield better plaque images, we performed MRI and histologic studies to compare the uptake of dextran-and mannan-dextrancoated USPIO (D-USPIO and DM-USPIO, respectively) by the atherosclerotic walls of rabbits. We intravenously injected atherosclerotic rabbits with DM-USPIO (n = 5) or D-USPIO (n = 5). Two rabbits were the controls. The doses delivered were 0.08 (dose 1) (n = 1), 0.4 (dose 2) (n = 1), or 0.8 (dose 3) (n = 3) mmol iron/Kg. The dose 3 rabbits underwent in vivo contrastenhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before and 5 days after USPIO administration. Afterwards, all animals were euthanized, the aortae were removed and subjected to in vitro MRI study. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the aortic wall in the same region of interest (ROI) was calculated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Histological assessment through measurement of iron-positive regions in Prussian blue-stained specimens showed that iron-positive regions were significantly larger in rabbits injected with DM-rather than D-USPIO (P , 0.05) for all doses.","Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response to vessel wall injury, leading potentially, to acute coronary syndrome and cerebral vascular disorders, induced by plaque rupture. The noninvasive imaging of atherosclerotic plaque progression and of therapeutic response is very important. In atherosclerosis, macrophage accumulation initiates lesion development and triggers clinical events by producing several molecules that promote inflammation, plaque disruption, and subsequent thrombus formation. [1] [2] [3] [4] However, conventional anatomic measurements of advanced lesions (eg, plaque size or luminal narrowing) do not necessarily correlate with macrophage content. It is desirable that imaging of macrophages permits the identification of highly activated plaques, to help in the prediction of acute thrombotic events, and to facilitate assessment of the therapeutic effects of antiatherosclerotic drugs, such as statins. In hyperlipidemic rabbits and humans, atherosclerotic plaques have been investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO): iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with low-molecular-weight dextran, having a mean diameter of 30 nm. [5] [6] [7] [8] As these relatively small particles are not immediately recognized by the hepatic and splenic mononuclear phagocytic systems (MPS), 9, 10 the prolongation of their intravascular half-life permits their uptake, via macrophages, by the whole body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, and the walls of atherosclerotic vessels. [5] [6] [7] [8] 11, 12 With respect to the excretion pathway, USPIO particles are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and metabolized via the lysosomal pathway. 13 On internalization by macrophages, the dextran coating is progressively degraded; 89% is eliminated in urine, and the rest is excreted in feces. The iron contained in USPIO is incorporated into the body's iron store and used in hemoglobin manufacture. Like endogenous iron, it is eliminated very slowly, predominantly via the feces. 14 Based on USPIO-associated T2-and T2*shortening effects, atherosclerotic lesions with accumulated USPIO can be detected on MRI scans. Higher doses tended to be administered in earlier animal studies. We posited that improved USPIO with higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would make it possible to obtain better images of plaques at lower doses."
,"As a transmissible infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successfully contained globally by instituting widespread quarantine measures. Although these measures were successful in terminating the outbreak in all areas of the world, the adverse effects of quarantine have not previously been determined in a systematic manner. In this hypothesis-generating study supported by a convenience sample drawn in close temporal proximity to the period of quarantine, we examined the psychological effects of quarantine on persons in Toronto, Canada. The 129 quarantined persons who responded to a Web-based survey exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were observed in 28.9% and 31.2% of respondents, respectively. Longer durations of quarantine were associated with an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Acquaintance with or direct exposure to someone with a diagnosis of SARS was also associated with PTSD and depressive symptoms.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was contained globally by widespread quarantine measures, measures that had not been invoked to contain an infectious disease in North America for >50 years (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Although quarantine has periodically been used for centuries to contain and control the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and the plague with some success (1) (2) (3) (4) (6) (7) (8) , the history of invoking quarantine measures is tarnished by threats, generalized fear, lack of understanding, discrimination, economic hardships, and rebellion (1, 3, 4, (6) (7) (8) ."
"Risk Factors for SARS among Persons without Known Contact with SARS Patients, Beijing, China EMERGENCE OF SARS","Most cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have occurred in close contacts of SARS patients. However, in Beijing, a large proportion of SARS cases occurred in persons without such contact. We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls matched for age group and sex. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have chronic medical conditions or to have visited fever clinics (clinics at which possible SARS patients were separated from other patients), eaten outside the home, or taken taxis frequently. The use of masks was strongly protective. Among 31 case-patients for whom convalescent-phase (>21 days) sera were available, 26% had immunoglobulin G to SARSassociated coronavirus. Our finding that clinical SARS was associated with visits to fever clinics supports Beijing's strategy of closing clinics with poor infection-control measures. Our finding that mask use lowered the risk for disease supports the community's use of this strategy.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus (1, 2) . Investigations of SARS outbreaks in several countries suggest that the primary mode of transmission is close contact with a symptomatic patient. Indeed, most cases of SARS have occurred among persons who cared for or lived with someone with the disease, and this fact is reflected in the SARS case definition developed by the World Health Organization and in definitions developed by individual countries (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) ."
Nosocomial Tuberculosis in India,"Most high-income countries implement tuberculosis (TB) infection control programs to reduce the risk for nosocomial transmission. However, such control programs are not routinely implemented in India, the country that accounts for the largest number of TB cases in the world. Despite the high prevalence of TB in India and the expected high probability of nosocomial transmission, little is known about nosocomial and occupational TB there. The few available studies suggest that nosocomial TB may be a problem. We review the available data on this topic, describe factors that may facilitate nosocomial transmission in Indian healthcare settings, and consider the feasibility and applicability of various recommended infection control interventions in these settings. Finally, we outline the critical information needed to effectively address the problem of nosocomial transmission of TB in India.","T he risk that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be transmitted from patients with active tuberculosis (TB) to other patients and healthcare workers has been recognized for many years (1) . The level of risk varies by setting, occupation, patient population, and effectiveness of TB infection control measures (2) (3) (4) (5) but is higher in facilities that manage large numbers of smear-positive TB patients who do not receive rapid diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, particularly in the absence of other infection control measures (2) (3) (4) (5) . A hierarchy of control measures, including administrative, engineering, and environmental controls and personal protection measures, has been recommended to reduce nosocomial TB risk (2, 3, 5, 6) . These recommended measures are implemented by healthcare facilities in high-income countries (3, 6) , but given their high cost, few facilities in low-income countries can afford to implement them."
"Clinical Manifestations, Laboratory Findings, and Treatment Outcomes of SARS Patients","Clinical and laboratory data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), particularly on the temporal progression of abnormal laboratory findings, are limited. We conducted a prospective study on the clinical, radiologic, and hematologic findings of SARS patients with pneumonia, who were admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital from March 8 to June 15, 2003. Fever was the most frequent initial symptom, followed by cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Twenty-four patients had various underlying diseases. Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lymphopenia. Other common abnormal laboratory findings included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. These clinical and laboratory findings were exacerbated in most patients during the second week of disease. The overall case-fatality rate was 19.7%. By multivariate analysis, underlying disease and initial CRP level were predictive of death.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease, first recognized in November 2002 (1) . SARS has spread rapidly around the world: >8,400 cases have been reported from 30 countries on five continents (2, 3) ."
"Nipah Virus Infection Outbreak with Nosocomial and Corpse-to-Human Transmission, Bangladesh","Active Nipah virus encephalitis surveillance identified an encephalitis cluster and sporadic cases in Faridpur, Bangladesh, in January 2010. We identified 16 casepatients; 14 of these patients died. For 1 case-patient, the only known exposure was hugging a deceased patient with a probable case, while another case-patient's exposure involved preparing the same corpse for burial by removing oral secretions and anogenital excreta with a cloth and bare hands. Among 7 persons with confirmed sporadic cases, 6 died, including a physician who had physically examined encephalitis patients without gloves or a mask. Nipah virus-infected patients were more likely than communitybased controls to report drinking raw date palm sap and to have had physical contact with an encephalitis patient (29% vs. 4%, matched odds ratio undefined). Efforts to prevent transmission should focus on reducing caregivers' exposure to infected patients' bodily secretions during care and traditional burial practices.","In Bangladesh, 135 probable or confirmed cases of Nipah virus (NiV) infection in humans were identified from 2001 through 2008; 98 (73%) were fatal (1) . Drinking raw date palm sap, contaminated by NiV from urine or saliva of Pteropus spp. fruit bats, has been identified as a vehicle for transmission of NiV to humans in Bangladesh (2, 3) . NiV, an RNA paramyxovirus (4), was isolated from human respiratory secretions, saliva, and urine during the outbreaks (5, 6) . Outbreak investigations in Bangladesh and India have repeatedly implicated person-to-person transmission of NiV, including health care-associated transmission in the Siliguri, India, outbreak in 2004 (7) (8) (9) (10) . However, to our knowledge, no evidence of NiV transmission to health care workers had been confirmed in Bangladesh (11) ."
Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) for Embryo Sex Determination in Pregnant Women at Eight Weeks of Pregnancy,"Background: In human, SRY (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) is the major gene for the testis-determining factor which is found in normal XY males and in the rare XX males, and it is absent in normal XX females and many XY females. There are several methods which can indicate a male genotype by the presence of the amplified product of SRY gene. The aim of this study was to identify the SRY gene for embryo sex determination in human during pregnancy using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. Methods: A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected, and Plasma DNA was extracted. LAMP assay was performed using DNA obtained for detection of SRY gene. Furthermore, colorimetric LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of SRY gene was developed. Results: LAMP results revealed that the positive reaction was highly specific only with samples containing XY chromosomes, while no amplification was found in samples containing XX chromosomes. A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos (46.6%) and eight female embryos (53.4%). All used visual components in the colorimetric assay could successfully make a clear distinction between positive and negative ones. Conclusion: The LAMP assay developed in this study is a valuable tool capable of monitoring the purity and detection of SRY gene for sex determination.","Introduction olecular mechanisms of sex determination involve a growing network of genes, a large number, which are transcription factors. The transcription factors so far are identified as having a major role in sex determination (1) . In humans, the gene for the testis-determining factor resides on the short arm of the Y chromosome. Individuals who are born with the short arm but not the long arm of the Y chromosome are male, while individuals born with the long arm of the Y chromosome but not the short arm are female (2) . By analyzing the DNA of rare XX men and XY women, the position of the testis-determining gene has been narrowed down to a 35,000-base-pair region of the Y chromosome located near the tip of the short arm (3) . In this region, a male-specific DNA se-quence was found that could encode a peptide of 223 amino acids. This peptide is probably a transcription factor, since it contains a DNA-binding domain called the HMG (high-mobility group) box (4, 5) . This domain is found in several transcription factors and non-histone chromatin proteins, and it induces bending in the region of DNA to which it binds (6) . This gene is called SRY (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome), and there is extensive evidence that it is indeed the gene that encodes the human testis-determining factor (7) (8) (9) (10) ."
Evolutionary Relationships between Bat Coronaviruses and Their Hosts,"Recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses (CoVs), and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during [2002][2003]. We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group. These shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits. This fi nding has implications for the emergence of SARS and for the potential future emergence of SARS-CoVs or related viruses.","Recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses (CoVs), and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during [2002] [2003] .

These events and the identifi ca-tion of SARS-CoV in animals associated with the wildlife trade in southern China (3) have led to a rapid resurgence of interest in CoVs of different origins. This resurgence led to discovery of 2 novel human CoVs (4, 5) ; identifi cation of SARS-like CoVs in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus macrotis, R. ferrumequinum, R. pearsoni, and R. sinicus) (6, 7) ; and identifi cation of other CoVs in bat species (R. sinicus, R. ferrumequinum, Miniopterus magnater [M. magnater has been misidentifi ed as M. schreibersi (8) in reports on SARS-like CoV], Pipistrellus abramus, P. pipistrellus, Tylonycteris pachypus, Myotis ricketti, and Scotophilus kuhlii) (7, (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, evolutionary relationships among these CoVs and their bat hosts have not been examined."
Rapid Identification of Emerging Pathogens: Coronavirus Rapid Identification of Emerging Pathogens,"We describe a new approach for infectious disease surveillance that facilitates rapid identification of known and emerging pathogens. The process uses broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify nucleic acid targets from large groupings of organisms, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for accurate mass measurements of PCR products, and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample. We demonstrate this principle by using 14 isolates of 9 diverse Coronavirus spp., including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We show that this method could identify and distinguish between SARS and other known CoV, including the human CoV 229E and OC43, individually and in a mixture of all 3 human viruses. The sensitivity of detection, measured by using titered SARS-CoV spiked into human serum, was ≈1 PFU/mL. This approach, applicable to the surveillance of bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal pathogens, is capable of automated analysis of >900 PCR reactions per day.","N ucleic acid tests for infectious diseases are primarily based on amplification methods that use primers and probes designed to detect specific organisms. Because prior knowledge of nucleic acid sequence information is required to develop these tests, they are not able to identify unanticipated, newly emergent, or previously unknown infectious organisms. Thus, the discovery of new infectious organisms still relies largely on culture methods and microscopy, which were as important in the recent identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as they were in the discovery of HIV 2 decades ago (1) (2) (3) (4) ."
"Late Recognition of SARS in Nosocomial Outbreak, Toronto","Late recognition of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was associated with no known SARS contact, hospitalization before the nosocomial outbreak was recognized, symptom onset while hospitalized, wards with SARS clusters, and postoperative status. SARS is difficult to recognize in hospitalized patients with a variety of underlying conditions in the absence of epidemiologic links.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread globally in 2003, infecting >8,000 people and killing nearly 800. In total, 438 probable or suspected SARS cases and 44 deaths were reported in Canada (1, 2) . SARS was first recognized retrospectively in Canada in a woman who had returned from Hong Kong on February 23, 2003. This international connection ignited the outbreak in Canada, which affected mainly the Toronto area (1, 2) ."
ICU = intensive care unit,"Disaster medical response has historically focused on the prehospital and initial treatment needs of casualties. In particular, the critical care component of many disaster response plans is incomplete. Equally important, routinely available critical care resources are almost always insufficient to respond to disasters that generate anything beyond a 'modest' casualty stream. Large-scale monetary funding to effectively remedy these shortfalls is unavailable. Education, training, and improved planning are our most effective initial steps. We suggest several areas for further development, including dual usage of resources that may specifically augment critical care disaster medical capabilities over time.","Disasters have been a part of human existence since ancient times, and so has disaster medicine [1] . We define disaster medicine as a human response to unexpected mayhem, with the intent to limit death, disease, and injury. In recent decades, disaster medical response has largely focused on prehospital care issues such as casualty evacuation, triage, and transport, without specific emphasis on hospital management. In the United States, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere'. Recent experiences with large-scale disasters have strongly reinforced the fact that hospital capacity is the major rate-limiting factor in the chain of medical response. This is especially true for critical care services and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity [2] . As we continue working to build adequate disaster medical response systems we must maintain our prehospital readiness efforts, and we must expand our focus to more precisely define the hospital and the ICU as critical links in the entire response process. The purpose of the present commentary is to explore ways in which this expansion of focus might be conceived."
Unhealthy Landscapes: Policy Recommendations on Land Use Change and Infectious Disease Emergence and Members of the Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence,"Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges.","Human-induced land use changes are the primary drivers of a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and also modifiers of the transmission of endemic infections (Patz et al. 2000) . These land use changes include deforestation, road construction, agricultural encroachment, dam building, irrigation, coastal zone degradation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, pathogen introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. These are important and complex issues that are understood only for a few diseases. For example, recent research has shown that forest fragmentation, urban sprawl, and biodiversity loss are linked to increased risk for Lyme disease in the northeastern United States (Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001) . Expansion and changes in agricultural practices are intimately associated with the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia (Chua et al. 1999; Lam and Chua 2002) , cryptosporidiosis in Europe and North America, and a range of food-borne illnesses globally (Rose et al. 2001) . Road building is linked to the expansion of bushmeat consumption that may have played a key role in the early emergence of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (Wolfe et al. 2000) , and simian foamy virus has been found in bushmeat hunters (Wolfe et al. 2004) ."
Modern approaches to understanding stress and disease susceptibility: A review with special emphasis on respiratory disease,"Studies in animals and humans link both physical and psychological stress with an increased incidence and severity of respiratory infections. For this manuscript we defi ne stress as the physiological responses an individual undergoes while adjusting to a continually changing environment. It is known that stressors of various types (psychological/physical) can alter the physiological levels of certain hormones, chemokines and cytokines. These alterations send information to the central nervous system to take necessary action which then sends messages to appropriate organs/tissues/cells to respond. These messages can either activate or suppress the immune system as needed and failure to compensate for this by the body can lead to serious health-related problems. Little is known how stress affects disease susceptibility, yet understanding this mechanism is important for developing effective treatments, and for improving health and food quality. The current review focuses on (a) the effects of psychological stressors in humans and animals, (b) various methodologies employed to understand stress responses and their outcomes, and (c) the current status of the attempts to correlate stress and disease with respiratory disease as model system. The methodologies included in this review span traditional epidemiological, behavioral and immunological studies to current high throughput genomic, proteomic, metabolomic/metabonomic approaches. With the advent of various newer omics and bioinformatics methodologies we postulate that it will become feasible to understand the mechanisms through which stress can infl uence disease onset. Although the literature in this area is limited because of the infancy of this research area, the objective of this review is to illustrate the power of new approaches to address complex biological questions. These new approaches will also aid in our understanding how these processes are related to the dynamics and kinetics of changes in expression of multiple genes at various levels.","From the preceding discussion it is clear that stress can be defi ned in many different ways depending upon the objectives or perspective of the researcher. All these defi nitions, however, share a common component of adaptive physiological responses following challenges to homeostasis. The adaptive reactions to stressors may involve mobilization of a wide variety of physiological responses including the immune response. Stress responses usually include physical perturbations that can encompass either the entire body or specifi c cellular compartments. Considering the volume of work in various areas of stressors and their effects the main objective of the current review is to focus on one type of stress, which includes psychological stressors."
"DETECTION OF CANINE PARVOVIRUS ANTIGEN IN DOGS IN KUMASI, GHANA","Background: Canine Parvovirus (CPV) in dogs has been documented in many countries. However, evidence of the infection is scanty in Ghana. This study was conducted to detect canine parvovirus antigen in dogs presented with diarrhoea to the Government Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. Materials and Methods: Faecal samples from 72 dogs presented with diarrhoea were tested for the presence of canine parvovirus antigen using commercially available rapid test kit (BIT® Rapid Colour Canine Parvovirus Ag Test Kit, BIOINDIST Co. Ltd, Korea) based on the principle of immunochromatography. Influence of breed, sex, age, vaccination history and the nature of diarrhoea were assessed. Data obtained was analysed with SPSS and subjected to the chi-square test. Significance was at α 0.05 Results: We found 61.11% tested positive (44/72) for CPV. Based on sex, 61.54% of males (20/33) and 60.61% of females tested positive (24/39). A total of 65.67% of samples from puppies below 6 months were positive. 56.25% of CPV vaccinated dogs and 70.83% of unvaccinated dogs were positive respectively. 69.05% of samples from haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs and 50.00% from non-haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs were positive of CPV.","Dogs are the most popular animals kept as pets in the world with an estimated population of 525 million as at 2012 (Coren, 2012; Gompper, 2013) . In Ghana, there is an increasing interest in keeping of dogs for various reasons hence it is necessary to have a knowledge of diseases and common conditions of dogs in the country. Diarrhoea in dogs is a common occurrence with a myriad of causes (Hubbard et al., 2007) which if not promptly and properly treated could have fatal outcome. Canine Parvovirus (CPV) is considered by many researchers as the leading cause of diarrhoea in dogs under 6 months old (Hackett and Lappin, 2003; Prittie, 2004 , Yesilbag et al., 2007 , Schulz et al., 2008 . Other clinical signs associated with CPV include acute vomiting, anorexia, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, dehydration and depression (Mitchell, 2015) . However, not all dogs with CPV enteritis present with bloody diarrhoea or leukopenia. Furthermore, other diseases such as enteropathogenic bacterial infection, parasitic infection, coronavirus or rotavirus infections are possible differentials to CPV (Nahat et al., 2015) . For the diagnosis of CPV, use of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly recommended to be used on faecal samples with accompanying histopathology and immunohistochemistry on necropsy specimens, however, in a poor resource setting, a rapid CPV Antigen test kit may be employed especially in dogs with diarrhoea."
,"Offi ce,",". Members of the B. burgdorferi s. l. group are the most common vectorborne pathogens of humans in central Europe (3) . The role of hedgehogs as hosts for these pathogens is, therefore, of considerable epidemiologic interest. Hedgehogs are a common synanthropic species that live in urban, suburban, and rural environments (4) and are known to carry not only the hedgehog tick, Ixodes hexagonus, but also the most common European tick, I. ricinus (2, 5) . Both of these ticks are known vectors of B. burgdorferi s. l. and tickborne encephalitis virus; I. ricinus is the most important vector of both throughout Europe (1, 5) . To date, however, only limited information has been available on the role of the hedgehog as a host or reservoir for B. burgdorferi s. l. in Germany."
Combining genetic and biochemical approaches to identify functional molecular contact points,"Protein-protein interactions are required for many viral and cellular functions and are potential targets for novel therapies. Here we detail a series of genetic and biochemical techniques used in combination to find an essential molecular contact point on the duck hepatitis B virus polymerase. These techniques include differential immunoprecipitation, mutagenesis and peptide competition. The strength of these techniques is their ability to identify contact points on intact proteins or protein complexes employing functional assays. This approach can be used to aid identification of putative binding sites on proteins and protein complexes which are resistant to characterization by other methods.","Protein-protein interactions are essential for most cellular processes. Not surprisingly, many human diseases can be linked to abnormal protein contacts, including some forms of leukemia and neurodegenerative disease (1) . Additionally, protein-protein interactions provide therapeutic targets in the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases (2) , and development of small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions is a burgeoning field of research."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore: Clinical Features of Index Patient and Initial Contacts,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging viral infectious disease.

,"From mid-July to the end of August 2005, a total of 215 cases of human Streptococcus suis infections, 66 of which were laboratory confirmed, were reported in Sichuan, China. All infections occurred in backyard farmers who were directly exposed to infection during the slaughtering process of pigs that had died of unknown causes or been killed for food because they were ill. Sixty-one (28%) of the farmers had streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; 38 (62%) of them died. The other illnesses reported were sepsis (24%) and meningitis (48%) or both.

SARS and Common Viral Infections,"In California, molecular testing was useful in decreasing suspicion for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), by detecting common respiratory pathogens (influenza A/B, human metapneumovirus, picornavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp., parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus) in 23 (45%) of 51 patients with suspected SARS and 9 (47%) of 19 patients with probable SARS.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has become the new paradigm for the global havoc that can be produced by an emerging infectious disease (1) . As of July 31, 2003, a total of 8,096 probable SARS cases had been reported to the World Health Organization from 29 countries or areas, with 774 deaths and a case-fatality ratio of 9.6% (2) . California was particularly affected by the SARS outbreak, reporting one fifth of suspect or probable cases in the United States (15% of suspect SARS cases and 26% of probable SARS cases), with two serologically confirmed cases. In 2002, the California Unexplained Pneumonia (CUP) Project, a respiratory surveillance project that uses enhanced laboratory techniques to identify etiologic agents of severe pneumonia, was initiated at the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Emerging Infections Program. The CUP project's extensive diagnostic testing algorithm was applied to specimens submitted to CDHS for SARS testing."
Altered distribution of mucosal NK cells during HIV infection,"The human gut mucosa is a major site of HIV infection and infection-associated pathogenesis. Increasing evidence shows that natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in control of HIV infection but the mechanism(s) by which they mediate antiviral activity in the gut is unclear. Here we show two distinct subsets of NK cells exist in the gut, one localized to intraepithelial spaces (IEL) and the other to the lamina propria (LP). The frequency of both subsets of NK cells was reduced in chronic infection, whereas IEL NK cells remained stable in spontaneous controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes. Both IEL and LP NK cells were significantly expanded in immunologic non-responsive (INR) patients, who incompletely recovered CD4+ T cells on HAART. These data suggest that both IEL and LP NK cells may expand in the gut in an effort to compensate for compromised CD4+ T cell recovery, but that only IEL NK cells may be involved in providing durable control of HIV in the gut, Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:","Over the course of past decade, our understanding of HIV-pathogenesis has changed considerably, as we have begun to appreciate the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in HIV-associated immunopathology [1] [2] [3] . Several lines of evidence suggest that HIV preferentially infects activated memory CD4+ T cells 4 , and therefore the gut, which harbors a large concentration of activated memory CD4+ T cells, provides fertile ground for rapid HIV infection and dissemination. As early as the first few weeks of HIV infection, significant physical and immunological changes occur in the gut, including a massive accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes 2,5,6 and a massive depletion of CD4+ T cells 7 . These dramatic changes in cell frequencies in the gut are accompanied by increased gut permeability resulting in microbial translocation, leading to elevated levels of microbial products in the blood such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that has been shown to contribute to the induction of immune activation 8 ."

Structural basis for human coronavirus attachment to sialic acid receptors HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections in humans and outbreaks of deadly pneumonia worldwide. Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which binds to host receptors and fuses the viral and cellular membranes. To understand the molecular basis of coronavirus attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, we determined cryo-EM structures of coronavirus OC43 S glycoprotein trimer in isolation and in complex with a 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. We demonstrate that the ligand binds with fast kinetics to a surface-exposed groove and interactions at the identified site are essential for S-mediated viral entry into host cells, but free monosaccharide did not trigger fusogenic conformational changes. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins that engage 9-O-acetyl-sialogycans, with an architecture similar to the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus hemagglutinin esterases and influenza virus C/D hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoproteins. Our results demonstrate these viruses evolved similar strategies to engage sialoglycans at the surface of target cells.","Coronaviruses are large, positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses in the Nidovirales order and are divided in four genera: α, β, γ and δ. Two β-coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21 st century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and was responsible for an epidemic that spread to five continents with a fatality rate of 10% before being contained in 2003 (with additional cases reported in 2004). The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets 1 and dromedary camels 2 , respectively. Four other coronaviruses of zoonotic origin are endemic in the human population, accounting for up to 30% of mild respiratory tract infections and also causing severe complications or fatalities in young children, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals 3, 4 . These viruses are HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (α-coronaviruses) as well as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (β-coronaviruses). Currently, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available to combat any human coronavirus. Furthermore, future crossspecies transmission events of coronaviruses seem likely given the large reservoir found in bats [5] [6] [7] . Studying coronaviruses will therefore help in understanding the principles governing cross-species transmission and adaptation to humans as well as in preparing for putative future zoonotic outbreaks."

Lack of Association between CLEC5A Gene Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Kawasaki Disease in Taiwanese Children,"Background. Kawasaki disease is characterized by systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. Previous genetic studies have identified certain candidate genes associated with susceptibility to KD and coronary artery lesions. Host innate immune response factors are involved in modulating the disease outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5) genetic polymorphisms with regards to the susceptibility and outcome of KD. Methods. A total of 1045 subjects (381 KD patients and 664 controls) were enrolled to identify 4 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of CLEC5A (rs1285968, rs11770855, rs1285935, rs1285933) by using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in cases and controls, and genetic effects were evaluated by the chi-square test. Results. No significant associations were noted between the genotypes and allele frequency of the 4 CLEC5A tSNPs between controls and patients. In the patients, polymorphisms of CLEC5A showed no significant association with coronary artery lesion formation and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response. Conclusions. This study showed for the first time that polymorphisms of CLEC5A are not associated with susceptibility to KD, coronary artery lesion formation, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response in a Taiwanese population.","Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by acute, febrile, and systemic vasculitis and was first described by Kawasaki et al. in 1974 [1] . In developed countries, KD is the leading cause of acquired heart diseases in children [2, 3] . KD occurs worldwide and particularly in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan and mainly affects children less than 5 years of age [4] [5] [6] . The most serious complication of KD is the occurrence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) [7, 8] . The prevalence of KD in children younger than 5 years is the highest in Japan, followed by Korea and Taiwan, and lowest in Europe. Previous studies have either failed to identify causative pathogens for KD or reported discrepant results [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, it is possible that a genetic background plays an important role in the pathogenesis of KD."

"Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infections in Healthcare Settings, Abu Dhabi","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections sharply increased in the Arabian Peninsula during spring 2014. In Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, these infections occurred primarily among healthcare workers and patients. To identify and describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of persons with healthcare-associated infection, we reviewed laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi during January 1, 2013-May 9, 2014. Of 65 case-patients identified with MERS-CoV infection, 27 (42%) had healthcare-associated cases. Epidemiologic and genetic sequencing findings suggest that 3 healthcare clusters of MERS-CoV infection occurred, including 1 that resulted in 20 infected persons in 1 hospital. MERS-CoV in healthcare settings spread predominantly before MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed, underscoring the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to healthcare facilities.","CoV) is a novel coronavirus first identified in the Middle East region in 2012. Epidemiologic aspects of this virus remain poorly defined, but human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities is recognized as a means of spreading infection (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . In Saudi Arabia, the country with the greatest number of MERS-CoV infections, exposures in healthcare facilities have resulted in repeated outbreaks and have been linked to spread of disease after the virus has been introduced from other sources (e.g., zoonotic) (5, 6, (8) (9) (10) (11) . The 2015 outbreak in South Korea is a dramatic example of extensive healthcare-associated transmission after a single introduction of MERS-CoV by an infected traveler; that introduction resulted in >180 documented infections in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevention measures (12, 13) . Because healthcare settings have the potential to contribute substantially to the spread of MERS-CoV infections, improving our understanding of infection risk and transmission patterns remains an urgent priority."
Report of the Federal Panel on Formaldehyde*,The Federal Panel on Formaldehyde concluded that definitive experiments exist which demonstrate the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of formaldehyde under laboratory conditions. Formaldehyde induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in a variety of test systems. Inhalation of formaldehyde causes cancer of the nose in rats. The concentrations of formaldehyde in inhaled air that caused nasal cancer in Fisher 344 rats are within the same order of magnitude as those to which humans may be exposed. The data presently available do not permit a direct assessment of the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde to man. Epidemiologic studies on exposed human populations are in progress and may further clarify the situation. Other experimental and human studies on toxic effects such as teratogenicity and reproductive disorders are as yet inadequate for a health risk assessment.,"The first evidence that formaldehyde might represent a carcinogenic risk for man was obtained in October 1979 from an ongoing animal experiment conducted by Battelle Columbus Laboratories for February 1982 the Chemical Industry Institute ofToxicology (CIIT) (1) . The preliminary results were reviewed by Federal Government scientists, who concurred with the CIIT conclusions. As the experiment progressed and more data became available, the need for a full review of the potential health risks to humans from chronic exposure to formaldehyde became evident."
Integrated Blood Barcode Chips,"Blood comprises the largest version of the human proteome1. Changes of plasma protein profiles can reflect physiological or pathological conditions associated with many human diseases, making blood the most important fluid for clinical diagnostics2-4. Nevertheless, only a handful of plasma proteins are utilized in routine clinical tests. This is due to a host of reasons, including the intrinsic complexity of the plasma proteome1, the heterogeneity of human diseases and the fast kinetics associated with protein degradation in sampled blood5. Simple technologies that can sensitively sample large numbers of proteins over broad concentration ranges, from small amounts of blood, and within minutes of sample collection, would assist in solving these problems. Herein, we report on an integrated microfluidic system, called the Integrated Blood Barcode Chip (IBBC). It enables on-chip blood separation and the rapid measurement of a panel of plasma proteins from small quantities of blood samples including a fingerprick of whole blood. This platform holds potential for inexpensive, non-invasive, and informative clinical diagnoses, particularly, for point-of-care.","separations from few-microliter quantities of blood, followed by rapid measurements of multiple plasma proteins are yet to be realized. The IBBC described herein was developed to rapidly assay a large panel of protein biomarkers in situ, starting from a fingerprick of whole blood. The immunoassay region of the chip is a microscopic barcode, integrated into a microfluidics channel, and customized for the detection of many proteins and/or for the quantitation of a single or few proteins over a broad concentration range. The versatility of this barcode immunoassay is demonstrated by detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from human serum over a 10 5 concentration range, and by stratifying 22 cancer patients via multiple measurements of a dozen blood protein biomarkers for each patient. Finally the IBBC is utilized to assay a blood protein biomarker panel from whole human blood, with all key steps in the immunoassay executed within 10 minutes of finger-prick blood collection."
A comparative study of experimental mouse models of central nervous system demyelination HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Several mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) are now available. We have established a mouse model, in which ocular infection with a recombinant HSV-1 that expresses murine IL-2 constitutively (HSV-IL-2) causes CNS demyelination in different strains of mice. This model differs from most other models in that it represents a mixture of viral and immune triggers. In the present study, we directly compared MOG 35-55 , MBP [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] models of EAE with our HSV-IL-2-induced MS model. Mice with HSV-IL-2-induced and MOG-induced demyelinating diseases demonstrated a similar pattern and distribution of demyelination in their brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In contrast, no demyelination was detected in the optic nerves of MBP-and PLP-injected mice. IFN-β injections significantly reduced demyelination in brains of all groups, in the spinal cords of the MOG and MBP groups, and completely blocked it in the spinal cords of the PLP and HSV-IL-2 groups as well as in optic nerves of MOG and HSV-IL-2 groups. In contrast to IFN-β treatment, IL-12p70 protected the HSV-IL-2 group from demyelination, while IL-4 was not effective at all in preventing demyelination. MOG-injected mice showed clinical signs of paralysis and disease-related mortality whereas mice in the other treatment groups did not. Collectively, the results indicate that the HSV-IL-2 model and the MOG model complement each other and, together, provide unique insights into the heterogeneity of human MS.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 400,000 individuals in the United States. The clinical symptomology ranges from relatively benign to devastating. In severe cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk with most MS patients experiencing muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance 1 . The course of the disease differs among affected individuals with some exhibiting relapsing-remitting disease and some progressive disease. Like other presumed autoimmune diseases, MS is more common in females and clinical symptoms are often first manifested during young adulthood 1, 2 . The disease is characterized by the development of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) that have an inflammatory component and frequently, but not always, by demyelination. The location of the lesions within the CNS differs amongst affected individuals and can occur in several different locations in any one individual. Epidemiologic studies of MS have implicated environmental as well as genetic factors in the disease process. Evidence has accumulated that infectious agents, particularly viral, may be involved 3, 4 ; however, this remains controversial [5] [6] [7] . If an infectious agent is involved, it alone may not be sufficient to initiate the observed pathology."
Bioinformatics analysis of SARS coronavirus genome polymorphism,"We have compared 38 isolates of the SARS-CoV complete genome. The main goal was twofold: first, to analyze and compare nucleotide sequences and to identify positions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertions and deletions, and second, to group them according to sequence similarity, eventually pointing to phylogeny of SARS-CoV isolates. The comparison is based on genome polymorphism such as insertions or deletions and the number and positions of SNPs.",Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease reported first in the autumn of 2002 and diagnosed for the first time in March 2003 [1] . It is still a serious threat to human health and SARS coronavirus (CoV) has been associated with the pathogenesis of SARS according to Koch's postulate [2] .
Influenza vaccination coverage rates in Europe -covering five consecutive seasons (2001-2006) in five countries,Objective To understand potential drivers and barriers to influenza vaccination in the general population. Methods 47 982 household surveys were conducted in five European countries between 2001 and 2006.,"The severity of influenza and the efficacy of vaccination are well documented in the medical literature. 1,2 Eradication of influenza is impossible but continuous immunization of the population can minimize the impact of the disease. 3 In addition to providing substantial health benefits, vaccination may also be associated with significant economic benefits, not only among the elderly but also among healthy working adults and children. Despite this knowledge and ongoing efforts by policy-makers, physicians and other healthcare providers, influenza vaccination rates in the five European countries surveyed remain limited, with the additional effect that manufacturing capacity may be too low for producing a sufficient amount of an appropriate monovalent vaccine when a pandemic occurs. 3 The WHO states that the risk of a new pandemic is at its highest level since the last pandemic in 1968. 4 This situation might influence the immunization coverage rates in the population."
"Asymptomatic SARS Coronavirus Infection among Healthcare Workers, Singapore","We conducted a study among healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) before infection control measures were instituted. Of all exposed HCWs, 7.5% had asymptomatic SARS-positive cases. Asymptomatic SARS was associated with lower SARS antibody titers and higher use of masks when compared to pneumonic SARS.","T he patterns of spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggest droplet and contact transmission (1, 2) . Close proximity of persons and handling of human secretions (respiratory secretions, feces, and the like) enhance the risk for transmission. These facts, together with the fact that transmission is more likely in more severely ill people (who end up in hospitals), have made the hospital setting particularly vulnerable to the rapid amplification of SARS (1) (2) (3) (4) ."
"Reference sequence (RefSeq) database at NCBI: current status, taxonomic expansion, and functional annotation","The RefSeq project at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) maintains and curates a publicly available database of annotated genomic, transcript, and protein sequence records (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). The RefSeq project leverages the data submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) against a combination of computation, manual curation, and collaboration to produce a standard set of stable, non-redundant reference sequences. The RefSeq project augments these reference sequences with current knowledge including publications, functional features and informative nomenclature. The database currently represents sequences from more than 55 000 organisms (>4800 viruses, >40 000 prokaryotes and >10 000 eukaryotes; RefSeq release 71), ranging from a single record to complete genomes. This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing. We summarize our approach to utilizing available RNA-Seq and other data types in our manual curation process for vertebrate, plant, and other species, and describe a new direction for prokaryotic genomes and protein name management.","For the past 15 years the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq database has served as an essential resource for genomic, genetic and proteomic research. The RefSeq project's provision of curated and stable annotated reference genomes, transcripts, and proteins for selected viruses, microbes, organelles, and eukaryotic organisms, has allowed researchers to focus on the best representative sequence data in contrast to the redundant data in GenBank, and to unambiguously reference specific genetic sequences. The RefSeq collection provides explicitly linked genome, transcript, and protein sequence records that incorporate publications, informative nomenclature, and standardized and expanded feature annotations. Ref- Research, 2016, Vol. 44, Database issue Seq records are integrated into NCBI's resources including the Nucleotide, Protein, and BLAST databases and can be easily identified by the keyword 'RefSeq' and by their distinct accession prefixes that define their type (Table 1) . All RefSeq data are subject to quality assurance (QA) checks with some specialized QA tests developed for different taxa or data types. For example, all viral RefSeqs undergo taxonomic review by NCBI staff before public release. RefSeq accessions are widely cited in scientific publications and genetic databases because they provide a stable and consistent coordinate system that can be used as a baseline for reporting gene specific data, clinical variation, and cross-species comparisons. These reference sequence standards are increasingly important because accurate reporting and reproducibility are vital components for best practices in biomedical research (1) ."
Extraction of Glycyrrhizic Acid and Glabridin from Licorice,"The extraction and separation conditions of glycyrrhizic acid and glabridin from licorice were investigated. By changing the different extraction solvents, procedures, times and temperature, the optimum extraction condition was established: the used of ethanol/water (30:70, v/v) as an extraction solvent, and 60 min dipping time under 50°C. The extracts of licorice were separated and determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a methanol/water (70:30, v/v, containing 1% acetic acid) as the mobile phase. Under the optimum extraction condition, 2.39 mg/g of glycyrrhizic acid and 0.92 mg/g of glabridin were extracted from Chinese licorice and the recoveries were 89.7% and 72.5% respectively.","Licorice, the root of the glycyrrhiza plant species, has been used medicinally for more than 4000 years [1] .

Mucosal Immunization Induces a Higher Level of Lasting Neutralizing Antibody Response in Mice by a Replication-Competent Smallpox Vaccine: Vaccinia Tiantan Strain,"The possible bioterrorism threat using the variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, has promoted us to further investigate the immunogenicity profiles of existing vaccines. Here, we study for the first time the immunogenicity profile of a replicationcompetent smallpox vaccine (vaccinia Tiantan, VTT strain) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) through mucosal vaccination, which is noninvasive and has a critical implication for massive vaccination programs. Four different routes of vaccination were tested in parallel including intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), oral (i.o.), and subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculations in mice. We found that one time vaccination with an optimal dose of VTT was able to induce anti-VTT Nabs via each of the four routes. Higher levels of antiviral Nabs, however, were induced via the i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the i.m. and s.c. routes. Moreover, the i.n. and i.o. vaccinations also induced higher sustained levels of Nabs overtime, which conferred better protections against homologous or alternating mucosal routes of viral challenges six months post vaccination. The VTT-induced immunity via all four routes, however, was partially effective against the intramuscular viral challenge. Our data have implications for understanding the potential application of mucosal smallpox vaccination and for developing VTT-based vaccines to overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity.","Smallpox, which was caused by infection with the variola virus, was one of the most deadly diseases in human history with a mortality rate of up to 50% [1, 2] . Fortunately, this disease was completely eradicated throughout the world by 1980 after the introduction of a global smallpox vaccination campaign [3] . During this process, vaccinia virus, which shares broad antigenic properties with the variola virus, played an essential role as an effective vaccine in inducing protective immunity against smallpox [3] [4] [5] . It is well accepted that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are critical to protection [6] [7] [8] . The fear of variola virus being deliberately released in potential bioterrorism attacks and the increasing use of vaccinia as vaccine vectors for other diseases such as AIDS have led to more recent studies aimed at understanding the protective immune responses induced by the smallpox vaccine [9, 10] . It is, therefore, necessary to investigate the neutralizing antibody responses induced by historically used smallpox vaccines via different route of vaccination."
Synthetic Antibodies with a Human Framework That Protect Mice from Lethal Sudan Ebolavirus Challenge Terms of Use,"The ebolaviruses cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever. There are five ebolavirus species; although much is known about Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and its neutralization by antibodies, little is known about Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), which is emerging with increasing frequency. Here we describe monoclonal antibodies containing a human framework that potently inhibit infection by SUDV and protect mice from lethal challenge. The murine antibody 16F6, which binds the SUDV envelope glycoprotein (GP), served as the starting point for design. Sequence and structural alignment revealed similarities between 16F6 and YADS1, a synthetic antibody with a humanized scaffold. A focused phage library was constructed and screened to impart 16F6-like recognition properties onto the YADS1 scaffold. A panel of 17 antibodies were characterized and found to have a range of neutralization potentials against a pseudotype virus infection model. Neutralization correlated with GP binding as determined by ELISA. Two of these clones, E10 and F4, potently inhibited authentic SUDV and conferred protection and memory immunity in mice from lethal SUDV challenge. E10 and F4 were further shown to bind to the same epitope on GP as 16F6 with comparable affinities. These antibodies represent strong immunotherapeutic candidates for treatment of SUDV infection.","T he ebolaviruses and Marburg virus (MARV) comprise the family Filoviridae of enveloped negative-sense RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fever. 1−4 Based on nucleotide sequence and outbreak location, isolates of Ebola virus are classified into five species: Zaire (EBOV), Tai Forest (TAFV), Sudan (SUDV), Reston (RESTV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV). There are two MARV variants (Marburg and Ravn). Severe human disease, Ebola or Marburg Viral Disease, is associated with EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, and MARV with 30− 90% case fatality rates in large outbreaks. 2 EBOV and SUDV are the most pathogenic among the ebolaviruses, and both have been associated with recurring outbreaks. 5 Among the 13 documented EBOV outbreaks and the six SUDV outbreaks from 1976 to 2012, the average human case fatality rates are 70% and 52%, respectively. Together, EBOV and SUDV have accounted for over 95% of Ebola virus-related deaths; 5 these statistics do not include the ongoing large outbreak in West Africa, which is of unprecedented scope and geographic distribution. 1,6 Many studies have been directed at understanding EBOV entry and inhibition of virus entry with antibodies and other agents; 3,4,7−9 however, considerably less is known about MARV and SUDV despite the increasing prevalence of these two species."
Frequency and clinical relevance of human bocavirus infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Objective: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infections in children. The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of HBoV infection in adult patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). Methods: We retrospectively tested 212 COPD patients, 141 (66.5%) with AE-COPD and 71 (33.5%) with stable disease, of whom nasal lavage and induced sputum had been obtained for the presence of HBoV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The specifi city of positive polymerase chain reaction results was confi rmed by sequencing. Results: Two hundred two of 212 patients for whom PCR results were available both for nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were eligible for data analysis. HBoV DNA was detected in three patients (1.5%). Of those, only one patient had AE-COPD. Thus, the frequency of HBoV infection demonstrated to be low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample in different patients, respectively. Sequencing revealed Ͼ99% sequence identity with the reference strain. Conclusion: HBoV detection was infrequent. Since we detected HBoV in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in AE-COPD as well as stable disease, a major role of HBoV infection in adults with AE-COPD is unlikely.","Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) account for a signifi cant number of hospitalizations and therefore present an important economic burden in health care. 1 AE-COPD substantially contribute to loss in lung function, disease progression, and mortality. 2 Most patients presenting with AE-COPD describe symptoms of respiratory infection. 3 Historically, bacteria have been considered to be the major cause of infectious exacerbations, but as bacteria are also found in clinically stable patients, the role of bacterial infection remains controversial. 4 With the broad availability of molecular diagnostics like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the prominent contribution of common viral agents of upper respiratory tract infection like human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to the etiology of AE-COPD has been increasingly recognized. [4] [5] [6] Nevertheless, in about one third of severe exacerbations the cause remains unknown. 1 In recent years novel respiratory viruses including the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and several coronaviruses (SARS, NL63, and HKU1) have been discovered. Their role in AE-COPD has already been defi ned to some extent. 7, 8 Ringshausen et al Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus initially discovered in 2005 in respiratory secretions of Swedish children with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection with a frequency of 3.1%. 9 Proving its role as a causative agent of acute respiratory tract infections is challenging as HBoV has not been propagated in cell culture and as animal models have not yet been established. Hence, some of the modifi ed postulates of Koch are not applicable. 10 Numerous retrospective and prospective studies suggested an association between HBoV and acute respiratory tract infections in children. Clinical fi ndings consisted of wheezing episodes, asthma exacerbations, acute obstructive bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Infants below the age of two years and patients with structural pulmonary diseases or immune disorders seem to be predominantly affected. Preliminary evidence is provided that acute HBoV infection may take a viremic course and may also be capable of persistence in the respiratory tract. 16 HBoV infections appear endemic worldwide. 16 First studies on the seroepidemiology give evidence for protection by maternal antibodies within the fi rst months of life. 17 In a Japanese study all of the 204 children examined had immunoglobulin G antibodies to the viral protein 1 (VP1) by the age of 6 years, emphasizing its ubiquitous nature. 18 Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that there is protective immunity after past infection which may explain why HBoV is comparatively rare in adults. 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] Frequencies of HBoV detection in respiratory specimens of children described in the literature vary from 2% to 19%. 11, 23 Recently, a HBoV detection rate of 12% has been described among German children with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. 24 To our knowledge the role of HBoV in a well characterized population of adult patients with AE-COPD has not been systematically studied yet. Implications of a frequent detection in AE-COPD are the introduction in clinical routine testing and a subsequent decrease of antimicrobial overuse. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of HBoV infection in hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to establish its potential clinical relevance by comparison to patients with stable COPD hospitalized for other reasons than acute exacerbation."
Viral membrane fusion,"Infection by viruses having lipid-bilayer envelopes proceeds through fusion of the viral membrane with a membrane of the target cell. Viral 'fusion proteins' facilitate this process. They vary greatly in structure, but all seem to have a common mechanism of action, in which a ligand-triggered, large-scale conformational change in the fusion protein is coupled to apposition and merger of the two bilayers. We describe three examples-the influenza virus hemagglutinin, the flavivirus E protein and the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-in some detail, to illustrate the ways in which different structures have evolved to implement this common mechanism. Fusion inhibitors can be effective antiviral agents.",substantial kinetic barriers both leading into this intermediate and leading away from it toward the product (Fig. 2) .
"we enrolled children with pneumonia who were admitted into wards of the De- partments of Respiratory Medicine, Infectious Diseases","we enrolled 4,225 hospitalized children with pneumonia in a study to determine the seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Beijing, China. We defined season as the period during which >10% of total PCRs performed each week were RSV positive. We identified 8 distinctive RSV seasons. On average, the season onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 of the next year (mid-May); 97% of all RSV-positive cases occurred during the season. RSV seasons occurred 3-5 weeks earlier and lasted ≈6 weeks longer in RSV subgroup A-dominant years than in RSV subgroup B-dominant years. Our analysis indicates that monitoring such RSV subgroup shifts might provide better estimates for the onset of RSV transmission. PCR-based tests could be a flexible or complementary way of determining RSV seasonality in locations where RSV surveillance is less well-established, such as local hospitals throughout China.","R espiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children worldwide (1-3); 2.7-3.8 million hospitalizations and 94,600-149,400 deaths occur each year among children <5 years of age as a result of RSV infection (4) . Studies have also demonstrated the contribution of RSV to respiratory tract infections in adults (5, 6) . However, no licensed RSV vaccine is available (7) , and the only approved specific therapy, palivizumab (anti-RSV antibody), has limited uses among infants at high risk for severe respiratory illness in high-resource settings (8) ."

The release of anthrax in 2001, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2002, and recent H1N1 swine flu outbreaks in 2009 are examples [1, 2, 3] . Lessons learned from those outbreaks include development of disease specific vaccines and effective outbreak detection algorithms that can be employed in biosurveillance systems [2, 4, 5] ."
Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis of the Evolutionary Relationship between Bovine Rhinitis A Viruses and Foot-And-Mouth Disease Virus Supplementary Issue: Current Developments in Veterinary Bioinformatics,"Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRVs) cause mild respiratory disease of cattle. In this study, a near full-length genome sequence of a virus named RS3X (formerly classified as bovine rhinovirus type 1), isolated from infected cattle from the UK in the 1960s, was obtained and analyzed. Compared to other closely related Aphthoviruses, major differences were detected in the leader protease (L pro ), P1, 2B, and 3A proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RS3X was a member of the species bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV). Using different codon-based and branch-site selection models for Aphthoviruses, including BRAV RS3X and foot-and-mouth disease virus, we observed no clear evidence for genomic regions undergoing positive selection. However, within each of the BRV species, multiple sites under positive selection were detected. The results also suggest that the probability (determined by Recombination Detection Program) for recombination events between BRVs and other Aphthoviruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus was not significant. In contrast, within BRVs, the probability of recombination increases. The data reported here provide genetic information to assist in the identification of diagnostic signatures and research tools for BRAV.","Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a leading cause of death of feedlot cattle in the USA. Annual costs associated with BRD total more than one billion dollars. Environmental stress, compromised host immunity, and virus infection predispose the animal to bacterial lung infection (broncho-pneumonia). 1 Primary virus infections damage the respiratory tract and subdue the host immune system. The respiratory tract commensal bacteria cause opportunistic secondary infections and lung pneumonia under immunecompromised conditions (caused by viral infection and other factors). In fact, previous studies have reported bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus, and bovine coronavirus from cattle with BRD. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although more than 40 years ago, studies concluded that bovine rhinitis viruses (BRVs) (then known as bovine rhinoviruses) cause mild respiratory disease in cattle, [7] [8] [9] [10] it is a surprise that BRVs are sparsely studied. This is partly due to the fact that the virus grows poorly in cell culture and is known to cause only selflimiting mild respiratory illness."
A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an architecturally diverse organelle that serves as a membrane source for the replication of multiple viruses. Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery 1 . Whether this virus-induced ER remodeling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6, an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) cloned over 30 years ago 2 , and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident HSP70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ERlocalized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outward from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments required for replication.","Viruses in the Flavivirus genus cause significant human disease. Innate immune control of these viruses is mediated by IFNs 3 , which induce transcription of hundreds of ISGs, some of which encode antiviral effector proteins 4 . To identify genes regulating the IFN response to a flavivirus, we used a genome-scale CRISPR approach to screen for single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that rendered cells permissive to infection with yellow fever virus expressing Venus (YFV-Venus) despite treatment with a highly suppressive dose of IFNα (Fig 1a) ."
Confl ict and Emerging Infectious Diseases,"Detection and control of emerging infectious diseases in confl ict situations are major challenges due to multiple risk factors known to enhance emergence and transmission of infectious diseases. These include inadequate surveillance and response systems, destroyed infrastructure, collapsed health systems and disruption of disease control programs, and infection control practices even more inadequate than those in resource-poor settings, as well as ongoing insecurity and poor coordination among humanitarian agencies. This article outlines factors that potentiate emergence and transmission of infectious diseases in confl ict situations and highlights several priority actions for their containment and control.","A n emerging infectious disease is one that is either newly recognized in a population or involves a recognized pathogen affecting new or larger populations or geographic areas (1, 2) . Disease emergence is infl uenced by ecologic and environmental changes (e.g., agriculture, deforestation, droughts, fl oods), human demographics and behavior (e.g., population migration, urbanization, international trade and travel), technology and industry, microbial adaptation, and breakdown in public health measures (1, 2) ."
"BMC Structural Biology A model of tripeptidyl-peptidase I (CLN2), a ubiquitous and highly conserved member of the sedolisin family of serine-carboxyl peptidases","Background: Tripeptidyl-peptidase I, also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of sedolisins (serine-carboxyl peptidases). In humans, defects in expression of this enzyme lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similar enzymes have been found in the genomic sequences of several species, but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted.","Although the existence of tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP-I) was first noted over 40 years ago [1] , the structural and mechanistic basis of its activity has been largely misunder-stood until quite recently. The situation changed after it was shown that TPP-I is identical to an independently characterized enzyme named CLN2. It was also demonstrated that mutations leading to abolishment of the enzymatic activity of CLN2 were the direct cause of a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [2] . This important observation was followed by the identification of CLN2 as a serine peptidase [3, 4] , without, however, specifying its structural fold and the details of the catalytic site. More accurate placement of CLN2 within the context of a family of related enzymes became possible only after high-resolution crystal structures of two bacterial enzymes with a limited sequence similarity to CLN2, sedolisin and kumamolisin, became available [5] [6] [7] . These structures defined a novel family of enzymes, now called sedolisins or serine-carboxyl peptidases, that is characterized by the utilization of a fully conserved catalytic triad (Ser, Glu, Asp) and by the presence of an Asp in the oxyanion hole [8] . Sedolisin and its several variants (e.g., kumamolisin, aorsin [9] , and physarolisin [10] ) have now been found in archaea, bacteria, fungi and amoebae, whereas the higher organisms seem to contain only variants of CLN2 [8] . The physiological role of sedolisins in the lower organisms has not yet been elucidated."
A LAIR-1 insertion generates broadly reactive antibodies against malaria variant antigens,"Plasmodium falciparum antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes are important targets of naturally acquired immunity against malaria, but their high number and variability provide the pathogen with a powerful means of escape from host antibodies 1-4 . Although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design, their identification has proven elusive. Here, we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment between the V and DJ segments.","expanded B cell clone and carry distinct somatic mutations in the LAIR-1 domain that abolish binding to collagen and increase binding to infected erythrocytes. These findings illustrate, with a biologically relevant example, a novel mechanism of antibody diversification by interchromosomal DNA transposition and demonstrate the existence of conserved epitopes that may be suitable candidates for the development of a malaria vaccine."
"Open Forum Infectious Diseases ® Multihospital Outbreak of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Deletion Variant, Jordan: A Molecular, Serologic, and Epidemiologic Investigation",Background. An outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Jordan in 2015 involved a variant virus that acquired distinctive deletions in the accessory open reading frames. We conducted a molecular and seroepidemiologic investigation to describe the deletion variant's transmission patterns and epidemiology.,"Health Organization review in September 2015. Sequencing performed by Lamers et al. [6] on samples from 13 outbreak cases found the virus to be associated with a novel recombinant clade that predominated in Saudi Arabia in 2015 [7] and was exported to South Korea and China [8] . Importantly, genetic analysis also revealed 2 unique mutations resulting from substantial deletion events-a 48-nucleotide (nt) in-frame deletion in accessory open reading frame (ORF) 4a present in sequences from 13 outbreak cases and an additional 9-nt in-frame deletion in ORF3 in a subset of case specimens collected later in the outbreak-leading the authors to conclude that all cases were infected following a single introduction of the virus [6] . We conducted an investigation that included additional viral genome and serologic analysis to describe the transmission patterns and epidemiology of MERS-CoV deletion variants during the 2015 Jordan outbreak. We reviewed outbreak investigation records, conducted key informant interviews with clinicians and infection control staff at the affected hospitals, and reviewed medical charts of confirmed cases. A confirmed MERS case met the World Health Organization case definition [9] and was laboratory-confirmed at the Jordan Central Public Health Laboratory using MERS-CoV N2 and/or N3 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays [10] . A case was considered health care-associated if they were a patient, visitor, or health care personnel (HCP) at a health care facility during the 14 days before symptom onset (exposure period), and if exposure to a known MERS case occurred exclusively in this setting [11] ."

Human coronavirus ocurrence in different populations of Sao Paulo: A comprehensive nine-year study using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract illnesses. An emergent human coronavirus was identified as the causal agent of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002-2003. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in worldwide populations. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of São Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001-2010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11.5%) of 1,087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002-2004 and 2008-2009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24.6%), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24.3%) and renal transplanted patients (20.2%). Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation of positive cases and wheezing, a lower respiratory tract infection symptom was reported by 12% of the total, and 27% of high at-risk patients. HCoVs may have an important role among patients with underlying conditions and transplanted ones.","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are positivestranded, enveloped RNA viruses classified within the family Coronaviridae (genus, Coronavirus) (Hendley et al., 1972) . They are associated mainly with respiratory tract illness but are also involved in enteric and central nervous system diseases (Resta et al., 1985; Murray et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1992) . Until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied. Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) were identified in the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966) and are well recognized as important pathogens that cause the common cold. A third novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the causal agent during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respi-ratory syndrome (SARS) (Drosten et al., 2003) . The increase in research on these viruses soon led to discovery of 2 other human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV-HKU1 in China (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) both detected in respiratory tract specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract illnesses. Since July 2003 when the last case of SARS associated with the epidemic was reported only four human coronaviruses are known to continuously circulate in the human population. Results from epidemiological studies have led to the conclusion that these viruses are worldwide distributed and circulate with biennial prevalence (McIntosh et al., 1970; Vabret et al., 2003; van Elden et al., 2004; Chiu et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2007) . However, there are few studies that have described the epidemiological and clinical features of human coronaviruses infection among different popula-tions, such as at-risk children or adults, patients with underlying conditions, those hospitalized, the immunocompromised patients and others, mainly in South America. In the present study, we retrospectively looked for the presence of HCoVs in different populations of Sao Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) from 2001 to 2010, to assess the prevalence that HCoVs infections have on different groups of Brazilian patients and to describe the clinical presentation of the ARIs caused by this virus and their circulation trends in Brazil."
Infection and Drug Resistance Management strategies in the treatment of neonatal and pediatric gastroenteritis,"Acute gastroenteritis, characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting, continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in mostly resourceconstrained nations. Although generally a mild and self-limiting disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden. Worldwide, up to 40% of children aged less than 5 years with diarrhea are hospitalized with rotavirus. Also, some microorganisms have been found predominantly in resource-constrained nations, including Shigella spp, Vibrio cholerae, and the protozoan infections. Prevention remains essential, and the rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated good safety and efficacy profiles in large clinical trials. Because dehydration is the major complication associated with gastroenteritis, appropriate fluid management (oral or intravenous) is an effective and safe strategy for rehydration. Continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended. New treatments such as antiemetics (ondansetron), some antidiarrheal agents (racecadotril), and chemotherapeutic agents are often proposed, but not yet universally recommended. Probiotics, also known as ""food supplement,"" seem to improve intestinal microbial balance, reducing the duration and the severity of acute infectious diarrhea. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases guidelines make a stronger recommendation for the use of probiotics for the management of acute gastroenteritis, particularly those with documented efficacy such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Saccharomyces boulardii. To date, the management of acute gastroenteritis has been based on the option of ""doing the least"": oral rehydration-solution administration, early refeeding, no testing, no unnecessary drugs.","Acute gastroenteritis (AGE), characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting, continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children mostly in resource-constrained nations. Although generally it is a mild and self-limiting disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden. 1, 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. 3 When young children suddenly experience an episode of acute diarrhea, with or without vomiting, infectious gastroenteritis is by far the most common explanation. 4 Viewed from a global perspective, gastroenteritis in children is of enormous public health importance."
An Evolutionary Change in Diagnostic Virology,"The earliest laboratory diagnoses of viral infections were made by microscopy just after the turn of the twentieth century. Animal and egg inoculation were the methods of choice until tissue culture and serology accelerated the field of diagnostic virology during the fifties and sixties. More rapid methods, including electron microscopy, immunoassays, and nucleic acid probes, are now available and influencing laboratory decisions and patient care. This review discusses changes in science and society which have influenced diagnostic virology and how the discipline has responded to these influences.","Diagnostic virology by definition is that which goes into formulating the diagnosis of a viral disease. Both clinical and laboratory aspects are part of this discipline. Rapid diagnosis refers to a laboratory diagnosis achieved in time to enable an influence on patient management. Although discoveries contributing to diagnostic virology began to accumulate at the turn of the century, diagnosis and management of most of the major viral illnesses have been accomplished during the past 50 years. Other reviews on the more recent developments in diagnostic virology have appeared [1, 2, 3] . This review will attempt to present the advances as they have evolved and to show how change has influenced direction in the field. Finally, an attempt will be made at predictions for the future."
,vaccinia and AIDS-associated complications that culminated in death of the recruit 18 months after vaccination.,"To the Editor: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) acquired from animals causes severe pneumonia in humans, with some chains of humanto-human transmission, leading to large outbreaks. MERS-CoV is a cause of concern for global public health. The only natural host of MERS-CoV identified so far is the dromedary camel (Camel dromedarius) (1, 2) , and transmission from camels to humans has been documented (3). The geographic distribution of MERS-CoV in dromedaries extends beyond the Arabian Peninsula (where human cases have been reported) to North and East Africa (where human cases have not been reported) (2, 4) . However, MERS-CoV from a camel in Egypt and MERS-CoV from a human were phenotypically similar in tropism and replication competence in ex vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract (5) ."
Descriptive review of geographic mapping of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the Internet,"From geographic mapping at different scales to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This paper reviews several geographic mapping efforts of SARS on the Internet that employ a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, overlay analysis and animation. The aim of these mapping services is to educate the public (especially travellers to potentially at-risk areas) and assist public health authorities in analysing the spatial and temporal trends and patterns of SARS and in assessing/revising current control measures.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious and potentially lethal atypical form of pneumonia that begins with deceiving common flu-like symptoms. On 16 November 2002, the first known case of SARS was discovered in Guangdong province in southern China. Since then the disease has spread rapidly along international air routes to other parts of the world. The number of reported SARS cases has increased exponentially, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to issue a global alert on 12 March 2003 [1] [2] [3] [4] . A novel coronavirus is the causative agent of SARS [5] ."
Coordinated Implementation of Chikungunya Virus Reverse Transcription-PCR,"A preformulated chikungunya virus real-time reverse transcription-PCR, quality-confi rmed oligonucleotides, and noninfectious virus controls were distributed by the European Network for the Diagnosis of Imported Viral Diseases. An international profi ciency study with 31 participants demonstrated that ad hoc implementation of molecular diagnostics was feasible and successful.","C hikungunya fever, caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is an acute febrile illness that causes severe and long-lasting arthralgia (1) . A recent and ongoing epidemic in the Indian Ocean area extended far beyond this region and caused hundreds of imported cases worldwide (2) (3) (4) . Chikungunya fever is diffi cult to clinically distinguish from co-endemic diseases such as malaria or dengue fever. Laboratory testing is required for appropriate case management and public health response (5) . Pilot studies have shown that reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) reliably detects acute infections in humans (3, 6) , but many laboratories were not ready to conduct such tests when this epidemic occurred."
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Dynamics and Antibody Responses among Clinically Diverse Patients, Saudi Arabia","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) shedding and antibody responses are not fully understood, particularly in relation to underlying medical conditions, clinical manifestations, and mortality. We enrolled MERS-CoVpositive patients at a hospital in Saudi Arabia and periodically collected specimens from multiple sites for real-time reverse transcription PCR and serologic testing. We conducted interviews and chart abstractions to collect clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory information. We found that diabetes mellitus among survivors was associated with prolonged MERS-CoV RNA detection in the respiratory tract. Among case-patients who died, development of robust neutralizing serum antibody responses during the second and third weeks of illness was not sufficient for patient recovery or virus clearance. Fever and cough among mildly ill patients typically aligned with RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract; RNA levels peaked during the first week of illness. These findings should be considered in the development of infection control policies, vaccines, and antibody therapeutics.","I nfection with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild or asymptomatic illness to severe respiratory failure (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) ; infection has a reported mortality rate of 35% (9) . Most MERS cases have been reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions (4, 7) . Asymptomatic or mild infections are typically reported in younger, healthy adults, including healthcare personnel (2, 4) . MERS-CoV transmission is commonly associated with exposure to symptomatic patients in healthcare (1, 2, 10, 11) or household (12) settings or with direct exposure to dromedary camels (13) ."
Meeting the Challenge of Infl uenza Pandemic Preparedness in Developing Countries etymologia etymologia,"Developing countries face unique diffi culties preparing for an infl uenza pandemic. Our current top-down approach will not provide these countries with adequate supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. Consequently, they will have to use a bottom-up approach based on inexpensive generic agents that either modify the host response to infl uenza virus or act as antiviral agents. Several of these agents have shown promise, and many are currently produced in developing countries. Investigators must primarily identify agents for managing infection in populations and not simply seek explanations for how they work. They must determine in which countries these agents are produced and defi ne patterns of distribution and costs. Because prepandemic research cannot establish whether these agents will be effective in a pandemic, randomized controlled trials must begin immediately after a new pandemic virus has emerged. Without this research, industrialized and developing countries could face an unprecedented health crisis.","M ore than a decade ago, the fi rst human cases of disease caused by avian infl uenza virus A (H5N1) appeared in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China. Six years ago, infl uenza virus A (H5N1) reemerged to cause highly lethal human disease in Southeast Asia. Health offi cials are concerned that these cases could be the harbinger of the next infl uenza pandemic. As a result, virtually all industrialized countries and many developing countries have mounted extensive pandemic preparedness efforts. However, as pointed out recently by Oshitani et al., industrialized countries face ""unique and diffi cult issues, which make preparing for a pandemic more challenging"" (1) ."
Multifunctional biophotonic nanostructures inspired by longtail glasswing butterfly for medical devices HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Numerous living organisms possess biophotonic nanostructures that provide coloration and other diverse functions for survival. While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing (Chorinea faunus) butterfly and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si 3 N 4 substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties that prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits and show that our Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#termsReprints and permission information is available online at www.nature.com/reprints.",device reduces the mean IOP measurement variation compared to conventional rebound tonometry without signs of inflammation.
"The impact of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus on hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract infections in young children: Slovenia, 2006-2011",Background Influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are important viral pathogens in childhood.,"Many respiratory viruses can affect young children, with influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being most recognized and important cause of disease of varying severity. 1, 2 Excess morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza have clearly been shown in persons over 65 years or having chronic medical condition. During the past decade, accumulated data on the impact of influenzarelated diseases in children have become available. The spectrum of symptoms caused by influenza viruses in children is highly divergent and may lead to the hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract disease or other complications. 1 Respiratory syncytial virus has been recognized as one of the most common causes of serious lower respiratory tract infections worldwide and causes a large disease burden among infants and young children <2 years of age. 2 While the greatest risk of severe disease occurs in infants and children with known high-risk conditions, most infants who are hospitalized with or die of RSV-related causes have no underlying medical conditions. 2 Effective preventive measures are available for several years against influenza and RSV for high-risk children. 1, 2 In last decade, Slovenian national immunization program recommends vaccination against influenza to children who are diagnosed with chronic medical conditions and are at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. The vaccination program has been expanded in 2009 when influenza vaccine was recommended to healthy children aged from 6 to 23 months. Despite the recommendations, the vaccination coverage remains <1% in children younger than 5 years of age. 3 From 2006 onward, children with serious congenital heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or born prematurely (before 29th week of gestation) are given in their first year of life human monoclonal antibodies against RSV (palivizumab) during the RSV season. 3 Influenza and RSV are important public health problems among children, as hospitalizations related to both pathogens occur frequently with limited number of deaths in developed, industrialized countries. 1, 2 Measuring the pediatric population-based disease burden of influenza is challenging. Using large databases and community influenza surveillance, population-based studies have documented excess hospitalizations, antibiotic use, and outpatient visits among children during the influenza season. 4, 5 Respiratory syncytial virus often circulates concurrently with influenza viruses, and it is difficult to distinguish the impact of those two viruses on morbidity, hospitalizations, and mortality in cold part of the year in the temperate climate. In young children, the estimates of burden of the disease for influenza might be confounded by RSV and vice versa. 6 We studied the excess hospitalizations for pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and bronchiolitis among children aged 5 years and younger in Slovenia during five influenza and RSV seasons in the period 2006-2011."
Successful natural interferon-b plus ribavirin therapy in a chronic hepatitis C patient after discontinuation of interferon-a treatment due to arrhythmia and interstitial pneumonia,"A 71-year-old female patient with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 had previously discontinued interferon (IFN)-a plus ribavirin therapy, pegylated IFN-a (pegIFNa) monotherapy, and natural IFN-a monotherapy because of arrhythmia, interstitial pneumonia, and severe neurovegetative symptoms. She subsequently completed 72 weeks of natural IFN-b plus ribavirin therapy without remarkable adverse effects and achieved a sustained viral response, suggesting differences in the pharmacological properties and biological effects of IFN-a and IFN-b. Thus, natural IFN-b plus ribavirin therapy may be a treatment option for patients with poor tolerance to IFN-a or pegIFNa treatments.","Treatments that help eradicate chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are essential for preventing disease progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1] . Interferon (IFN) is the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C, and the combination of pegylated interferon-a (pegIFN-a) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy produces a sustained anti-viral response (SVR) in 50 % of patients infected with high viral loads of HCV genotype 1. Furthermore, higher SVR rates follow triple therapy with pegIFN-a and RBV plus telaprevir or simeprevir [2] . However, some patients fail to complete IFN treatments because of adverse effects such as interstitial pneumonia (IP), which is known as a critical adverse effect and can lead to death [3] , and cardiovascular events such as arrhythmia, which are rare among IFN-treated hepatitis C patients [4] . In contrast, the rates of treatment discontinuation and/or dose modification due to severe adverse effects of natural IFN-b (nIFN-b) are reportedly low [5, 6] , and the efficacy of combination therapy with RBV for genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C has been demonstrated [6] ."
,"Thirty-one cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred after exposure in the emergency room at the National Taiwan University Hospital. The index patient was linked to an outbreak at a nearby municipal hospital. Three clusters were identified over a 3-week period. The first cluster (5 patients) and the second cluster (14 patients) occurred among patients, family members, and nursing aids. The third cluster (12 patients) occurred exclusively among healthcare workers. Six healthcare workers had close contact with SARS patients. Six others, with different working patterns, indicated that they did not have contact with a SARS patient. Environmental surveys found 9 of 119 samples of inanimate objects to be positive for SARS coronavirus RNA. These observations indicate that although transmission by direct contact with known SARS patients was responsible for most cases, environmental contamination with the SARS coronavirus may have lead to infection among healthcare workers without documented contact with known hospitalized SARS patients.","downtown Taipei not far from hospital A. The ER is organized into several sections, including triage, examination, observation, critical care, and a clean area reserved for staff activities. A SARS screening unit was established on March 17, 2003, to interview and triage febrile patients with suspected cases of SARS. The patients were questioned about the presence of fever, myalgia, gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, whether they had close contact with a SARS patient, and recent travel. N95 respirators were placed on patients suspected to have SARS early during the triage process, and they were immediately placed in private rooms (SARS area) to avoid contact with others in the ER. A daily record was maintained of all patients screened in the SARS screening unit. SARS cases were defined according to the World Health Organization criteria (10) , modified to expand the definition of contact to include any healthcare setting with nosocomial transmission."

"Influenza D Virus Infection in Dromedary Camels, Ethiopia","Influenza D virus has been found to cause respiratory diseases in livestock. We surveyed healthy dromedary camels in Ethiopia and found a high seroprevalence for this virus, in contrast to animals co-existing with the camels.

I nfluenza D virus (IDV) was first isolated from pigs with respiratory symptoms in the United States in 2011 (1). Epidemiologic analyses revealed that the most likely main host of IDV is cattle, because the seropositivity rate in these animals is higher than that for other livestock (2-4). In a recent report, dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) exhibited substantially high seroprevalence (99%) for IDV in Kenya (5), suggesting that this animal is a potential reservoir of IDV. We examined seroprevalence of IDV in dromedary camels in Ethiopia and in Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) in Mongolia.","Influenza D virus has been found to cause respiratory diseases in livestock.

,"The recent SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak exploded on an unsuspecting public and functionally paralyzed health care delivery systems in many countries. Cancer treatments were deferred and elective surgeries, clinic visits and diagnostic tests were postponed. Other collateral damage includes the devastating psychological distress suffered by patients who were isolated from their families, those same families who could not visit their ill loved ones, patients awaiting access to various aspects of the health care system, and health care workers. We are all starting to dig out, and this process will take many months at a minimum and we may never completely return to the way we were. This commentary addresses the implications of a modern-day epidemic like SARS, focusing on the intensive care unit setting, with special attention given to the effect on health care workers. We explore some of the ethical challenges posed to relationships, professional integrity and resource allocation.","SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) exploded on the face of the global village and on health care like a dormant volcano erupting in the dead of night.

The Human Sodium Iodide Symporter as a Reporter Gene for Studying Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Pathogenesis,"Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is frequently used in oncology and cardiology to evaluate disease progression and/or treatment efficacy. Such technology allows for real-time evaluation of disease progression and when applied to studying infectious diseases may provide insight into pathogenesis. Insertion of a SPECT-compatible reporter gene into a virus may provide insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and viral tropism. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), a SPECT and positron emission tomography reporter gene, was inserted into Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in afflicted humans to obtain a quantifiable and sensitive marker for viral replication to further MERS-CoV animal model development. The recombinant virus was evaluated for fitness, stability, and reporter gene functionality. The recombinant and parental viruses demonstrated equal fitness in terms of peak titer and replication kinetics, were stable for up to six in vitro passages, and were functional. Further in vivo evaluation indicated variable stability, but resolution limits hampered in vivo functional evaluation. These data support the further development of hNIS for monitoring infection in animal models of viral disease. IMPORTANCE Advanced medical imaging such as single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) enhances fields such as oncology and cardiology. Application of SPECT/CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography to infectious disease may enhance pathogenesis studies and provide alternate biomarkers of disease progression. The experiments described in this article focus on insertion of a SPECT/CT-compatible reporter gene into MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a functional SPECT/CT reporter gene can be inserted into a virus.","iments are frequently hampered by sacrificing the subject to identify the source of the reporter gene signal (5) (6) (7) . Applying medical imaging technology, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), to animal models of human infectious disease provides the capability to serially monitor anatomical and physiological responses to infection in the same subject that can be clinically translated. Generating a virus that carries a SPECT/PET-compatible reporter gene furthers that capability by serial, real-time evaluation of virus kinetics, identification of tissue tropism, and determination of pathogenic mechanisms. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) gene has emerged as one of the most promising reporter genes in preclinical and translational research for oncology and gene therapy (8, 9) ."
Epidemiologic Clues to SARS Origin in China SARS Origin in China,"An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began in Foshan municipality, Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. We studied SARS case reports through April 30, 2003, including data from case investigations and a case series analysis of index cases. A total of 1,454 clinically confirmed cases (and 55 deaths) occurred; the epidemic peak was in the first week of February 2003. Healthcare workers accounted for 24% of cases. Clinical signs and symptoms differed between children (<18 years) and older persons (>65 years). Several observations support the hypothesis of a wild animal origin for SARS. Cases apparently occurred independently in at least five different municipalities; early case-patients were more likely than later patients to report living near a produce market (odds ratio undefined; lower 95% confidence interval 2.39) but not near a farm; and 9 (39%) of 23 early patients, including 6 who lived or worked in Foshan, were food handlers with probable animal contact.","O n March 12, 2003 , the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, and in Vietnam (1).

Patient Preference and Adherence Dovepress The efficacy of herbal therapy on quality of life in patients with breast cancer: self-control clinical trial,"Background: Mounting evidence indicates that herbal therapy is effective in alleviating anxiety, lessening cancer treatment-related side-effects, and facilitating rehabilitation. This is the first trial to examine the herbal therapy of combined yunzhi and danshen on quality of life among breast cancer patients. Methods: A multicenter, longitudinal, and self-control study was used. Eighty-two breast cancer patients were given combined yunzhi and danshen capsules for six months on a daily basis. Data collection including quality of life, vitality status and adverse effects were taken. Results: Results showed a significant improvement in physical function, role-physical, roleemotion and health transition (P , 0.05). Patients also reported less fatigue, better quality of sleep, better appetite, more regular bowel movements and more stable emotions (P , 0.05). As far as side-effects were concerned, only mild discomforts including sore throat (13.4%) and dry mouth (9.8%) were recorded. Conclusion: The findings add clinical evidence to support the beneficial effects of herbal therapy on quality of life and vitality status in breast cancer patients. Therefore, herbal therapy has a potentially important role to play in managing psychological distress in cancer patients. This study also suggests that herbal therapy is clinically acceptable and can be used safely with breast cancer patients.","Breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer to affect women. 1 While cancer itself is a life-threatening disease, treatments for cancer can produce very unpleasant complications and side effects, including fatigue, anxiety, menopausal symptoms, nausea, lymphedema, and dermatitis.

Sequencing of the human IG light chain loci from a hydatidiform mole BAC library reveals locus-specific signatures of genetic diversity HHS Public Access Author Manuscript,"Germline variation at immunoglobulin (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete haplotype sequences in these regions has been problematic because of complex sequence architecture and diploid source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the effectively haploid human hydatidiform mole cell line, CHM1htert, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype generated here is 1.25 Mb of contiguous sequence, including four novel V alleles and one novel C allele and an 11.9 kb insertion. The CH17 IGK haplotype consists of two 644 kb proximal and 466 kb distal contigs separated by a large gap of unknown size; these assemblies added 49 kb of unique sequence extending into this gap. Our analysis also resulted in the characterization of seven novel IGKV alleles and a 16.7 kb region exhibiting signatures of interlocus sequence exchange between distal and proximal IGKV gene clusters. Genetic diversity in IGK/IGL was compared to that of the IG heavy chain (IGH) locus within the same haploid genome, revealing 3-fold (IGK) and 6-fold (IGL) higher diversity in the IGH locus, potentially associated with increased levels of segmental duplication and the telomeric location of IGH.","Introduction Immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies are essential components of the adaptive immune system that play key roles in processes associated with innate and adaptive immunity. They are expressed by B cells as either cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, and are formed by two pairs of identical ""heavy"" and ""light"" kappa or lamda protein chains, encoded by genes located at three major loci in the human genome: the IG heavy (IGH) at 14q32.33, and the IG light lambda (IGL) and kappa (IGK) loci, located at 22q11.2 and 2p11.2, respectively (1) . Specifically, through a unique mechanism referred to as V-(D)-J rearrangement (2) , individual Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes at the IGH locus, and V and J genes at either the IGK or IGL loci rearrange somatically at the DNA level to generate V-D-J and V-J regions that, after transcription and translation, encode the variable domains of the antibody (1) . V-(D)-J rearrangement is accompanied by the random addition and deletion of nucleotides at the junctions of the combined V, D, and J genes by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). The extreme variability observed in expressed antigen-naïve B cell antibody repertoires is due to this combinatorial and junctional diversity, and partly ensures that the immune system is able to recognize and mount effective immune responses against a diverse range of potential pathogens. At the population and species level, IG haplotype and allelic variation also make important contributions to the diversity of expressed antibody repertoires (3) (4) (5) (6) ; however, the roles of IG genetic polymorphism in antibody function have not been comprehensively investigated (7) ."

A superspreading strain might be marked with other pathobiologically important features. In the case presented here (indeed emerging and MDR), the NGS-based in silico spoligotyping would confuse the MDR/extensively drug resistant SIT266 with ""less dangerous"" SIT264. To be precise, the revealed discrepancy is not inherent to the NGS technology itself. Although the general limitation of the use of short sequencing reads to infer repetitive genome regions is known, it did not pose a problem in our study. However, both bioinformatics tools predicted the spoligoprofile solely from the presence or absence of spacer sequences and did not take into account a ""hiding"" effect exerted by a putative IS6110 insertion on adjacent spacer under classical spoligotyping.","To the Editor: Accumulating evidence indicates that dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) are a reservoir for zoonotic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although numerous studies have looked at other livestock in the Middle East region, evidence for MERS-CoV infection has only been found in dromedaries (1). Extensive and continuous circulation of MERS-CoV occurs in the Al Shahaniya region of Qatar, most likely because of the presence of an international camel racing track and numerous barns holding camels (2, 3) . In April 2015, we investigated the MERS-CoV infection status of 15 healthy alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in a herd of 20 animals and 10 healthy dromedaries in a herd of 25 animals at a farm in this region (online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/6/15-2113-Techapp1.pdf)."

Onset of symptoms for severe acute respiratory syndrome by number of shifts worked (dashed lines represent 95% confidence limits).","To determine factors that predispose or protect healthcare workers from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), we conducted a retrospective cohort study among 43 nurses who worked in two Toronto critical care units with SARS patients. Eight of 32 nurses who entered a SARS patient's room were infected. The probability of SARS infection was 6% per shift worked. Assisting during intubation, suctioning before intubation, and manipulating the oxygen mask were high-risk activities. Consistently wearing a mask (either surgical or particulate respirator type N95) while caring for a SARS patient was protective for the nurses, and consistent use of the N95 mask was more protective than not wearing a mask. Risk was reduced by consistent use of a surgical mask, but not significantly. Risk was lower with consistent use of a N95 mask than with consistent use of a surgical mask. We conclude that activities related to intubation increase SARS risk and use of a mask (particularly a N95 mask) is protective."
Functional ultrastructure of the plant nucleolus,"Nucleoli are nuclear domains present in almost all eukaryotic cells. They not only specialize in the production of ribosomal subunits but also play roles in many fundamental cellular activities. Concerning ribosome biosynthesis, particular stages of this process, i.e., ribosomal DNA transcription, primary RNA transcript processing, and ribosome assembly proceed in precisely defined nucleolar subdomains. Although eukaryotic nucleoli are conservative in respect of their main function, clear morphological differences between these structures can be noticed between individual kingdoms. In most cases, a plant nucleolus shows well-ordered structure in which four main ultrastructural components can be distinguished: fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar component, granular component, and nucleolar vacuoles. Nucleolar chromatin is an additional crucial structural component of this organelle. Nucleolonema, although it is not always an unequivocally distinguished nucleolar domain, has often been described as a well-grounded morphological element, especially of plant nucleoli. The ratios and morphology of particular subcompartments of a nucleolus can change depending on its metabolic activity which in turn is correlated with the physiological state of a cell, cell type, cell cycle phase, as well as with environmental influence. Precise attribution of functions to particular nucleolar subregions in the process of ribosome biosynthesis is now possible using various approaches. The presented description of plant nucleolar morphology summarizes previous knowledge regarding the function of nucleoli as well as of their particular subdomains not only in the course of ribosome biosynthesis.","Almost to the end of the twentieth century, the nucleolus was recognized only as a factory producing ribosomes that is maintained by them (Mélèse and Xue 1995) . Thus, it was thought that nucleolar dynamics was associated solely with storage and traffic of numerous proteins and ribonucleoproteins involved in ribosome particle biosynthesis and transport. Moreover, due to mutual integration of these processes, three nucleolar compartments were recognized, i.e., fibrillar centers (FCs), dense fibrillar component (DFC), and granular component (GC; Goessens 1984; ."
Structural basis for viral 5′-PPP-RNA recognition by human IFIT proteins,"IFIT proteins are interferon-inducible, innate immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation initiation machinery. However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5′-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a nonsequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5′-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.","Keywords innate immunity; TPR; IFIT1; ISG56; interferon; viral RNA; triphophosphate RNA; IFIT5; ISG58; crystal structure The innate immune system relies on several germ-line encoded receptors to distinguish self from non-self molecules in order to mount an appropriate early defence response. During viral infection, non-self molecules are derived from viral genomes generally in the form of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or 5′-triphosphorylated RNA (PPP-RNA) that is not protected by a 5′-cap. The canonical host proteins responsible for sensing or interacting with these foreign nucleic acids include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) 1 . Recently, an unbiased proteomics approach discovered that the interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) could also directly engage PPP-RNA 2 ."
"Anticipated Negative Responses by Students to Possible Ebola Virus Outbreak, Guangzhou, China","we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,295 undergraduate students in Guangzhou, China, where the population of immigrants from Africa is high (online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/1/15-0898-Techapp1.pdf). Our aim was to measure students' anticipated negative emotional responses and avoidance activities (dependent variables) to a possible outbreak of EVD (5). We constructed scales for the dependent and independent variables to assess EVD-related perceptions: 1) misconceptions/knowledge about transmission modes, 2) scenarios of an EVD outbreak in Guangzhou (chances, severity, control), 3) efficacy of preventive measures and self-protection, and 4) public stigma toward EVD survivors.

Phylogenetic Insight into Zika and Emerging Viruses for a Perspective on Potential Hosts,"Global viral diversity is substantial, but viruses that contribute little to the public health burden or to agricultural damage receive minimal attention until a seemingly unimportant virus becomes a threat. The Zika virus (ZIKV) illustrated this, as there was limited information and awareness of the virus when it was identified as a public health emergency in February 2016. Predicting which virus may pose a future threat is difficult. This is in part because significant knowledge gaps in the basic biology and ecology of an emerging virus can impede policy development, delay decision making, and hinder public health action. We suggest using a phylogenetic framework of pathogens and their infected host species for insight into which animals may serve as reservoirs.","The Zika virus (ZIKV) is just the latest in a growing list of pathogens [e.g., Ebola virus, avian influenza virus, West Nile virus (WNV)] that threaten human health, agricultural resources, and wildlife. Global viral diversity is substantial, but viruses that have a low public health burden or cause negligible agricultural damage tend to receive little to no attention. However, viral evolution, spillover events, or changes in hosts can turn seemingly unimportant viruses into biosecurity threats or public health emergencies. Case in point, the scientific community had limited information or awareness of ZIKV when the World Health Organization (WHO) identified it as a public health emergency in February 2016. We know that the emergence of a new pathogen can be caused by changes in human population distributions and behaviors, land use and biodiversity shifts, climate change, international trade, and changes in vector or reservoir host ecology (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Morse et al. 2012; Woolhouse et al. 2014) . Beyond identifying likely locations of emerging diseases (Jones et al. 2008) , it is difficult to predict the next specific public health crisis and prevent the next pandemic (Han et al. 2016) . During an outbreak, public health organizations scramble to understand the nature of a threat and what actions are required to mitigate it. Significant overall knowledge gaps regarding the transmission and maintenance of an emerging virus can delay policy and public health response. Our need to guide policy in the face of incomplete knowledge highlights the importance of basic science research."
Massively parallel pathogen identification using high-density microarrays,"Identification of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens is still performed by phenotypic methods that are often slow and cumbersome, despite the availability of more comprehensive genotyping technologies. We present an approach based on whole-genome amplification and resequencing microarrays for unbiased pathogen detection. This 10 h process identifies a broad spectrum of bacterial and viral species and predicts antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity and virulence profiles. We successfully identify a variety of bacteria and viruses, both in isolation and in complex mixtures, and the high specificity of the microarray distinguishes between different pathogens that cause diseases with overlapping symptoms. The resequencing approach also allows identification of organisms whose sequences are not tiled on the array, greatly expanding the repertoire of identifiable organisms and their variants. We identify organisms by hybridization of their DNA in as little as 1-4 h. Using this method, we identified Monkeypox virus and drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a skin lesion taken from a child suspected of an orthopoxvirus infection, despite poor transport conditions of the sample, and a vast excess of human DNA. Our results suggest this technology could be applied in a clinical setting to test for numerous pathogens in a rapid, sensitive and unbiased manner.","Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. Rapid and accurate identification of the aetiological agent, be it an old or an emerging pathogen, can influence prognosis by enabling appropriate interventions, such as drug treatment, to be promptly initiated."
Pandemic Infl uenza and Pregnant Women,"Planning for a future infl uenza pandemic should include considerations specifi c to pregnant women. First, pregnant women are at increased risk for infl uenza-associated illness and death. The effects on the fetus of maternal infl uenza infection, associated fever, and agents used for prophylaxis and treatment should be taken into account. Pregnant women might be reluctant to comply with public health recommendations during a pandemic because of concerns regarding effects of vaccines or medications on the fetus. Guidelines regarding nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., voluntary quarantine) also might present special challenges because of confl icting recommendations about routine prenatal care and delivery. Finally, healthcare facilities need to develop plans to minimize exposure of pregnant women to ill persons, while ensuring that women receive necessary care.","I nfl uenza pandemics occur when a new infl uenza type A virus to which the population has no immunity emerges, spreads effi ciently between humans, and results in worldwide outbreaks of severe disease. Pandemics occur infrequently but can be devastating in terms of the effects on illness and mortality. Most infl uenza experts consider infl uenza pandemics inevitable (1) . The emergence of avian infl uenza A virus (H5N1) as a cause of severe human infections has increased concerns about an impending pandemic. Although human disease caused by infl uenza (H5N1) is a rare event (2) , the virus has become endemic among bird populations in some areas of Asia and has continued to spread geographically and to broaden its host range. Concerns that the virus might acquire the ability to effi ciently spread between humans have led public health authorities to accelerate preparations for pandemic infl uenza."
Strategies for intranasal delivery of vaccines,"The vast majority of human pathogens colonize and invade at the mucosal surfaces. Preventing infection at these sites via mucosally active vaccines is a promising and rational approach for vaccine development. However, it is only recently that the stimulation of local immunity at the mucosal surfaces has become a primary objective in addition to inducing systemic immunity. This review describes vaccine formulations designed for mucosal delivery to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, via intranasal administration. The association of antigens with mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems is emphasised.","Vaccination is one of the most successful accomplishments of medical science. Diseases that were prevalent are now increasingly rare because of the widespread use of vaccines. Next to clean water, no single intervention has had such an overwhelming effect on reducing mortality from childhood diseases as the use of vaccines [1] . The smallpox vaccine has eradicated a disease that had a 30 % fatality rate [2] . After over two decades of intensive efforts, the global polio eradication initiative is approaching its final stage aided by the two polio vaccines developed by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin [3] . Nevertheless, next-generation vaccines are required to combat prevalent diseases."
Prone to survive and the priority rule in science,"In 2005 we published the first study to show that mortality can be reduced by prone ventilation [1] . This study followed the large trial by the Prone-Supine Study Group of Gattinoni and colleagues published in the NEJM in 2001 [2] and another in 2005 that failed to show benefit [3] . We have speculated that the earlier trials failed to show benefit because the protocols of these studies stipulated that physicians do not change ventilator settings during the period of prone ventilation (in order to standardize the changes in gas exchange induced by this maneuver). As per protocol, both the prone and supine groups were subjected to the same mean airway pressures (MAP) and tidal volumes even after it was noted that the PaO 2 :FiO 2 had improved in the prone group and they could be managed with lower MAP [4] . Gattinoni responded to our criticism of his study and conceded that, in retrospect, our approach of reducing ventilation as oxygenation improved was more appropriate [4] . Now a new study by the PROSEVA group has found that prone ventilation does indeed save lives. The stated rationale for the new study by the PROSEVA Study Group of Guerin and colleagues, in severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) [5] , was the meta-analysis data showing improved survival with prone position in patients with severe hypoxemic ARDS. The authors overcame the drawback of the older studies by targeting the a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram and the PEEP level selected from a PEEP-FiO 2 table and they have demonstrated a survival advantage for prone ventilation. However, analysis stratified according to quartile of PaO 2","In 2005 we published the first study to show that mortality can be reduced by prone ventilation [1] .

They assumed a priori that benefits will accrue only to those with severe ARDS and so they report that prone ventilation helps this group, although their analysis shows severity of ARDS has little to do with improved survival. The authors do not acknowledge our previous communications in the literature. We point to more than a matter of priority in science, which is important in itself. Our findings suggest that prone ventilation may be beneficial in reducing ventilator-induced lung injury in all ventilated patients and this needs to be investigated in a wider context."
Multiplex isothermal solid-phase recombinase polymerase amplification for the specific and fast DNA-based detection of three bacterial pathogens,"We report on the development of an on-chip RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) with simultaneous multiplex isothermal amplification and detection on a solid surface. The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxysilanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38°C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in <20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics.","The amplification of a specific DNA sequence for the detection of a pathogen is a common tool in molecular diagnostics. An established technique for nucleic acid amplification is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [1, 2] . However the use of this method in miniaturized lab on-chip devices for point-ofcare testing is challenging due to the high electricity demand of the thermocycling process [3] . The design of portable and automated systems for low-resource settings is limited as a result of the high complexity of the reaction setup and the precise temperature control necessary to conduct the amplification."
Pros-thetic valve endocarditis caused by Myco-plasma hominis,LETTERS a cause of endocarditis as well as the occurrence of mycoplasma bacteremia in the absence of underlying infection of the endocardium.,"To the Editor: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, were fi rst isolated in 1956 (1); to date, >100 serotypes have been identifi ed on the basis of nucleotide sequence homologies. HRVs were previously divided into 2 genetic groups, HRV-A (n = 75) and HRV-B (n = 25). Recently, a putative new and distinct rhinovirus group, HRV-C, has been reportedly found in some patients with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . To extend these initial fi ndings and assess the pathogenicity of HRV-C, we investigated its prevalence as well as its clinical and molecular features in children with lower acute RTIs in Beijing, People's Republic of China."
Novel Norovirus in Dogs with Diarrhea,"To identify the prevalence and genetic variability of noroviruses in dogs, we tested fecal samples by using reverse transcription-PCR.

Antibody Response and Disease Severity in Healthcare Worker MERS Survivors,"We studied antibody response in 9 healthcare workers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who survived Middle East respiratory syndrome, by using serial ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay testing. Among patients who had experienced severe pneumonia, antibody was detected for >18 months after infection. Antibody longevity was more variable in patients who had experienced milder disease.","A study evaluating the immune response in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) showed antivirus antibodies in survivors can be detected by ELISA and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for up to 24 months after infection (1) . Another study revealed that SARS-CoV antibodies were not detectable at 6 years after infection (2) . Antibody response to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) typically is detected in the second and third week after the onset of the infection (3) (4) (5) , but little is known about the longevity of the response or whether the decrease in antibody response over time correlates with the severity of the initial infection. We conducted a longitudinal study of antibody response among a cohort of MERS survivors who had been treated at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (KFSHRC-J)."
designed the research studies,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people in Africa, Europe, and Asia1,2 since its re-emergence in Kenya in 2004. The severity of disease and spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or anti-viral therapies. Here, we describe a novel vaccine that protects against emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates (NHP). We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses. Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from different CHIKV strains. Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high dose challenge. We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, establishing a humoral mechanism of protection. Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans.","albopictus5, that survives in temperate climates and is widely distributed6.

"Phosphonooxymethyl Prodrug of Triptolide: Synthesis, Physicochemical Characterization, and Efficacy in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma and Ovarian Cancer Xenografts","A disodium phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of the antitumor agent triptolide was prepared from the natural product in three steps (39% yield) and displayed excellent aqueous solubility at pH 7.4 (61 mg/mL) compared to the natural product (17 μg/mL). The estimated shelf life (t 90 ) for hydrolysis of the prodrug at 4°C and pH 7.4 was found to be two years. In a mouse model of human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), the prodrug administered intraperitoneally was effective in reducing or eliminating xenograft tumors at dose levels as low as 0.3 mg/kg when given daily and at 0.9 mg/kg when given less frequently. When given via intraperitoneal and oral routes at daily doses of 0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg, the prodrug was also effective and well tolerated in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer (A2780).","Triptolide (1, Figure 1 ), a diterpene triepoxide, was first isolated from the medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF) and structurally characterized in 1972. 1 In the following 43 years, it has been reported to be active in vitro by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of various cancer cell lines and as preventing tumor growth and metastases in vivo. 2 More recently, triptolide has been found to be effective against various cancers such as pancreatic cancer, 3 neuroblastoma, 4 breast cancer, 5 and prostate cancer. 6 The mechanisms of action of triptolide have been extensively investigated, 7, 8 and evidence has been provided that triptolide can covalently modify proteins presumably by epoxide ring opening reactions. 1,2,9−11 It was recently shown that triptolide inhibits the ATPase activity of human XPB (xeroderma pigmentosum B) by covalently binding Cys342 of XPB to the 12,13-epoxide. 9, 10 Because XPB is part of transcription factor THFIIH, RNA II polymerase-mediated transcription and DNA excision repair are inhibited. 9 Many of the observed anticancer effects can be explained by this mechanism, but other mechanisms 12 have been observed such as epigenetic modifications, suppressing kinases, and Hsp70 expression. 3, 13, 14 Triptolide was also reported to be the first DCTPP1 (dCTP pyrophosphatase) inhibitor. 15 It is of interest to note that this is a noncovalent interaction of triptolide with the target protein. Furthermore, the compound has multiple biological activities that could have value in other therapeutic areas. 2, 16 Triptolide was reported to stimulate polycystin-2 channel opening, thereby restoring calcium signaling and resulting in attenuation of cyst formation in a mouse model of polycystic kidney disease. 17 It is also known for its reversible male antifertility effects. 18 In addition, triptolide was shown to preserve cognitive function in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. 19, 20 The anticancer and other activities of triptolide such as its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties are more thoroughly described in recent reviews. 6, 7, 12 Recent studies focus on the development of triptolide and its derivatives as potential antileukemic 21 and antineoplastic agents. 22, 23 Despite its promising bioactivities, poor aqueous solubility, dose-dependent toxicity, narrow therapeutic window, and lack of patent protection of triptolide are impediments to its preclinical development and clinical success. Two early stage clinical trials of triptolide as a potential drug for rheumatoid arthritis were conducted in the US over a decade ago. 24, 25 The 5-hydroxytriptolide derivative 5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8, 2, Figure 1 ) is currently in phase I clinical trial in China for rheumatoid arthritis. 16 Prodrug strategies, involving carboxylic and amino acid esters, have been utilized previously with the intent to achieve desirable water solubility of triptolide. 26, 27 While several prodrugs of triptolide have been reported in the literature, triptolide succinate (omtriptolide, F6008, PG490-88, 3, Figure  1 ) is the only one reported to have entered clinical trials. 28 Unfortunately, the cleavage of the prodrug moiety was slow and incomplete, and significant interpatient variability was reported. 29 This does not discount the prodrug strategy but suggests that other prodrugs that provide a reliable release of triptolide are needed. A nontoxic, water-soluble, chemically stable, and patentable prodrug approach would be a viable option to overcome some of the physicochemical limitations of triptolide for the clinical development of this natural product."
Respiratory source control using a surgical mask: An in vitro study,"Cough etiquette and respiratory hygiene are forms of source control encouraged to prevent the spread of respiratory infection. The use of surgical masks as a means of source control has not been quantified in terms of reducing exposure to others. We designed an in vitro model using various facepieces to assess their contribution to exposure reduction when worn at the infectious source (Source) relative to facepieces worn for primary (Receiver) protection, and the factors that contribute to each. In a chamber with various airflows, radiolabeled aerosols were exhaled via a ventilated soft-face manikin head using tidal breathing and cough (Source). Another manikin, containing a filter, quantified recipient exposure (Receiver). The natural fit surgical mask, fitted (SecureFit) surgical mask and an N95-class filtering facepiece respirator (commonly known as an ""N95 respirator"") with and without a Vaselineseal were tested. With cough, source control (mask or respirator on Source) was statistically superior to mask or unsealed respirator protection on the Receiver (Receiver protection) in all environments. To equal source control during coughing, the N95 respirator must be Vaseline-sealed. During tidal breathing, source control was comparable or superior to mask or respirator protection on the Receiver. Source control via surgical masks may be an important adjunct defense against the spread of respiratory infections. The fit of the mask or respirator, in combination with the airflow patterns in a given setting, are significant contributors to source control efficacy. Future clinical trials should include a surgical mask source control arm to assess the contribution of source control in overall protection against airborne infection.","Over the past decade, the appearance of novel airborne viruses and the reemergence of tuberculosis have posed major public health threats. The most appropriate means of protection, for health care workers (HCW) against such threats, is not well defined. [1, 2] Some studies have suggested the use of surgical masks for HCW as inhalational barrier protection. [3, 4] However, surgical masks are neither tested nor certified for use as respiratory protective devices. They are classified under United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 CFR 878.4040, as a general classification of medical apparel intended to protect both patients and persons in contact with patients from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate materials. Respirators, in contrast, are designated as inhalational protection devices. [5] [6] [7] Regulatory recommendations are often based on in vitro assessments of filtration efficiency. [8] [9] [10] However, clinically relevant in vivo studies are limited and may not reflect the in vitro data. [11] For example, studies conducted during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks failed to show significant differences in rates of infection between HCW wearing surgical masks or respirators. [4, 12, 13] In addition, in vitro studies have shown that N95 respirators and surgical masks may underperform when challenged with viruses of smaller particle sizes such as influenza. [8, 14] Reponen et al. reported that the physical size of the SARS coronavirus and influenza virus classifies them as highly penetrable through both surgical masks and N95 respirators. [14] Both masks and respirators are defined as Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for their distinct protective benefits, but both National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) characterize PPE as ""the last line of defense, "" encouraging administrative and engineering controls to mitigate Figure . Model of source manikin, receiver manikin, and environment interplay. Model of source manikin, receiver manikin, and environment interplay. Parameters can be set or measured. Dilution is an effect of the environment on the concentration of produced aerosols. Filtration (capture efficiency) is a function of the mask used and takes place at both the source and receiver. Particles that are not captured can be deflected (outward leakage around the faceseal perimeter) by the mask at the source and carried away from the receiver by the environmental flow. Breathing patterns simulate adults with tidal breathing or coughing. environmental exposure. Our study assesses the efficacy of surgical masks in providing secondary protection to healthcare workers and others in relation to masks and respirators used for personal protection."

Full-Genome Deep Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel Human Betacoronavirus,"A novel betacoronavirus associated with lethal respiratory and renal complications was recently identified in patients from several countries in the Middle East. We report the deep genome sequencing of the virus directly from a patient's sputum sample. Our high-throughput sequencing yielded a substantial depth of genome sequence assembly and showed the minority viral variants in the specimen. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome (England/ Qatar/2012) revealed its close relationship to European bat coronaviruses circulating among the bat species of the Vespertilionidae family. Molecular clock analysis showed that the 2 human infections of this betacoronavirus in June 2012 (EMC/2012) and September 2012 (England/Qatar/2012) share a common virus ancestor most likely considerably before early 2012, suggesting the human diversity is the result of multiple zoonotic events.","A novel betacoronavirus associated with lethal respiratory and renal complications was recently identified in patients from several countries in the Middle East.

,"We studied transmission patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among medical students exposed exclusively to the first SARS patient in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, before his illness was recognized. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 66 medical students who visited the index patient's ward, including 16 students with SARS and 50 healthy students. The risk of contracting SARS was sevenfold greater among students who definitely visited the index case's cubicle than in those who did not (10/27 [41%] versus 1/20 [5%], relative risk 7.4; 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 53.3). Illness rates increased directly with proximity of exposure to the index case. However, four of eight students who were in the same cubicle, but were not within 1 m of the index casepatient, contracted SARS. Proximity to the index casepatient was associated with transmission, which is consistent with droplet spread.

SARS is characterized by symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and dry cough, with radiographic evidence of pneumonia in most patients. The incubation period of SARS is estimated to be a median of 4 to 6 days (range 2-10 days). SARS is contagious, and person-to-person transmission appears to occur primarily through contact or respiratory droplets (5) . However, because of the efficient transmission of SARS observed in some situations (6, 7) , concerns remain about the spread of SARS-CoV through other means, including small aerosols or contact with contaminated environmental surfaces."
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Risk for Frontline Health Care Workers,"To determine whether frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at greater risk for contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 than nonclinical staff, we conducted a study of 231 HCWs and 215 controls. Overall, 79 (17.7%) of 446 had a positive antibody titer by hemagglutination inhibition, with 46 (19.9%) of 231 HCWs and 33 (15.3%) of 215 controls positive (OR 1.37, 95% confi dence interval 0.84-2.22). Of 87 participants who provided a second serum sample, 1 showed a 4-fold rise in antibody titer; of 45 patients who had a nose swab sample taken during a respiratory illness, 7 had positive results. Higher numbers of children in a participant's family and working in an intensive care unit were risk factors for infection; increasing age, working at hospital 2, and wearing gloves were protective factors. This highly exposed group of frontline HCWs was no more likely to contract pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infl uenza infection than nonclinical staff, which suggests that personal protective measures were adequate in preventing transmission.","A ustralia was affected early in the (H1N1) 2009 infl uenza pandemic with 37,636 cases and 191 deaths reported.

,"To identify environmental sites commonly contaminated by avian infl uenza virus A (H5N1) in live-bird markets in Indonesia, we investigated 83 markets in 3 provinces in Indonesia. At each market, samples were collected from up to 27 poultry-related sites to assess the extent of contamination. Samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and virus isolation. A questionnaire was used to ascertain types of birds in the market, general infrastructure, and work practices. Thirty-nine (47%) markets showed contamination with avian infl uenza virus in >1 of the sites sampled. Risk factors were slaughtering birds in the market and being located in West Java province. Protective factors included daily removal of waste and zoning that segregated poultry-related work fl ow areas.

"College of Public Health and Health Informatics, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences","Introduction: In recent years, several research studies have investigated health promotion practices in Saudi healthcare organizations, yet no published literature exists on health promotion practices of primary healthcare professionals working for the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNG-HA). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a convenience sample of 206 primary healthcare professionals at the MNG-HA. A self-reporting questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes, awareness, satisfaction, and methods regarding health promotion practices of primary healthcare professionals. Results: Of the 206 primary healthcare professionals surveyed, 58.1% reported awareness of health promotion programs conducted in the hospitals and 64.6% reported that the health promotion system in the hospitals needs to be improved. Language barriers and cultural beliefs were viewed as obstacles to carrying out effective health promotion by 65% and 64.6% of primary healthcare professionals, respectively. The majority (79.9%) of the primary healthcare professionals perceived themselves as having the necessary skills to promote health and 80.6% believed that printed educational materials are the most prevalent method of health promotion/education, whereas 55.8% reported that counseling was the most preferred method of health promotion. Conclusion: The awareness level of health promotion policies, strategies, and programs conducted in the hospitals was not found to be satisfactory. Therefore, widespread training programs are recommended to improve the health promotion system in the hospitals. These programs include facilitating behavioral change,","The dramatically increasing rates of communicable diseases within the Middle East such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the noncommunicable diseases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia necessitate the study of current health promotion practices within a healthcare setting. 1, 2 This is of particular importance when dealing with a population that tends to seek medical attention only after the development of disease. 3 Effective health promotion is considered as one of the fundamental requirements to prevent outbreaks and manage chronic diseases. 4, 5 The health promotion responsibility is shared among individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service institutions, and governments (WHO, 1986) . The role of healthcare professionals including physicians and nurses has been emphasized in the literature. 6 -11 Moreover, nurses play an important role in health promotion by encouraging patients and their families to be part of the decision-making process regarding problems related to their health, improving adherence of patients to long-term therapies, and improving their quality of life. 7 -9 Despite the tendency of physicians to focus on diagnosis and treatment of illness after its occurrence, they also have an essential role in incorporating health promotion and disease prevention at all levels, including health improvement, risk reduction, early identification of disease, and reduction of complications. 11 Their role can be effective through providing counseling services where they are required to be updated with relevant guidelines, and ensuring that their recommendations are supported by the best evidence. 12 Over the years, there has been increasing debate on whether health promotion revolves only around health education and disease prevention. Clinical health promotion has been chosen for this study because of its broader definition, including patient counseling. 13 Clinical health promotion involves delivery of healthcare services, whether it be in the office, hospital or community setting. 14 Herbert and Visser indicate that it ""predisposes, enables and reinforces patients to take greater control of the non-medical determinants of their own health."" 15 Health promotion and education activities are a fundamental requirement for all health professionals. 4, 16, 17 Evaluation of the obstacles and constraints of health promotion are essential to the effective implementation of the practice; especially in the primary healthcare setting where the objectives of the healthcare professionals may not always meet those of the patients. 18 Various interventions exist when it comes to health promotion/education methods. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of delivery in patient education with regard to patient clinical outcome, satisfaction, and efficacy. 19 In our study, we investigated the most widely available methods of health promotion/education and the methods most preferred by healthcare professionals. The study was designed in such a way to allow further study on a larger scale in an attempt to build on what has been used and practiced. On reviewing the literature, we found that health promotion in a clinical setting has been widely investigated in Western communities. 20 -21 The attitudes of physicians and nurses toward disease prevention and health promotion activities in primary care settings have recently been investigated in a large multicenter study in Spain. It revealed an acceptable attitude towards prevention and health promotion (PHP) activities, but recommended that healthcare organizations increase health promotion activities to improve professional skills and provide appropriate care. 20 A study that was conducted in Saudi Arabia concerning the perceived practice of health promotion among nurses identified language barriers and cultural competencies as great obstacles in the process of delivering effective health promotion in the region. 22 However, little is known about the practice of health promotion in Saudi Arabia. 22 -24 Thus, we found that there is a need for such a study that assesses the practice of health promotion locally. The purpose of this study was to describe the perceived health promotion practices among primary healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) in the primary healthcare setting of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNG-HA). The current investigation intended to address the following research question: what are the attitudes, awareness, and satisfaction levels of primary healthcare professionals on health promotion practices and methods? The study attempted to provide an overview of the perceived practices of health promotion in the MNG-HA, and to reveal the need for training programs in the context of the increasing rates of communicable and non-communicable diseases in the country."
"Sequential Emergence and Wide Spread of Neutralization Escape Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Mutants, South Korea, 2015 Appendix Materials and Methods Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Culture and Plaque Assay","Wild-type Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or I529T mutant MERS-CoV isolated from patients in South Korea (GenBank accession nos.

Rapid Genome Sequencing of RNA Viruses,We developed a system for rapid determination of viral RNA sequences whereby genomic sequence is obtained from cultured virus isolates without subcloning into plasmid vectors. This method affords new opportunities to address the challenges of unknown or untypeable emerging viruses.,"O ver the past few years, global migration has led to emerging infectious diseases that pose substantial risks to public health. To prevent potential outbreaks, early detection of infectious pathogens is necessary. In particular, the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) provided important lessons on how unknown viruses should be detected rapidly. Thus, a standardized and qualified system is required for rapid nucleic acid sequence determination for newly emerging viruses."
"Chikungunya Fever in Travelers Returning to Europe from the Indian Ocean Region, 2006","Chikungunya fever has spread through several Indian Ocean islands and India, including popular travel destinations. To compare usefulness of diagnostic tests and to understand reasons for the magnitude and severity of an outbreak, we used 3 diagnostic methods to test 720 samples from 680 patients returning to Europe from the Indian Ocean region in 2006. Chikungunya infection was confi rmed for 24.4% patients in the fi rst half of the year and for 9.9% in the second half. Reverse transcription-PCR was positive for all samples taken up to day 4 after symptom onset. Immunofl uorescence detected immunoglobulin (Ig) M on day 1 and IgG on day 2 for some patients, and in all patients from day 5 onward. Soon after onset of symptoms, patients had IgG and IgM and high viral loads (some >10 9 copies/mL plasma). These data will help healthcare providers select diagnostic tests for returning travelers.","I n 2005 and 2006 an outbreak of chikungunya fever of unprecedented magnitude spread over the western Indian Ocean region, including the Comoros Islands, Mauritius, Réunion Island, Madagascar, and the Seychelles (1, 2) . By October 2006 on Réunion Island alone, which has a population of 760,000, at least 266,000 cases had been reported (3) . The epidemic swept eastward into the Indian subcontinent, where by the end of the year it had caused >1.3 million cases; attack rates were 45% in some regions (4, 5) . By the beginning of 2007, the epidemic was on the decline on La Réunion and the Seychelles (6), but it seems to be continuing in areas of India. New outbreaks have been reported from early 2007 in Malaysia and mid 2007 in Indonesia (7, 8) ."
Four cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurred from,"in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, were investigated. Clinical specimens collected from these patients were tested by provincial and national laboratories in China as well as members of the World Health Organization SARS Reference and Verification Laboratory Network in a collaborative effort to identify and confirm SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Although SARS-CoV was not isolated from any patient, specimens from three patients were positive for viral RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and all patients had detectable rises in SARS-CoV-specific antibodies.

This case was rapidly followed by reports of three additional cases, all linked to a region in Guangzhou (10) . Although none of these cases was fatal or resulted in documented secondary transmission, they demonstrate that community-acquired infection with SARS-CoV, and potential reemergence of SARS leading to epidemic spread, remains a possibility. These cases also highlight some issues associated with diagnosing and confirming the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. In this report we describe the laboratory diagnosis and associated confirmation of SARS-CoV infection for these four cases."

Bench-to-bedside review: Outcome predictions for critically ill patients in the emergency department,"The escalating number of emergency department (ED) visits, length of stay, and hospital overcrowding have been associated with an increasing number of critically ill patients cared for in the ED. Existing physiologic scoring systems have traditionally been used for outcome prediction, clinical research, quality of care analysis, and benchmarking in the intensive care unit (ICU) environment. However, there is limited experience with scoring systems in the ED, while early and aggressive intervention in critically ill patients in the ED is becoming increasingly important. Development and implementation of physiologic scoring systems specific to this setting is potentially useful in the early recognition and prognostication of illness severity. A few existing ICU physiologic scoring systems have been applied in the ED, with some success. Other ED specific scoring systems have been developed for various applications: recognition of patients at risk for infection; prediction of mortality after critical care transport; prediction of in-hospital mortality after admission; assessment of prehospital therapeutic efficacy; screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome; and prediction of pediatric hospital admission. Further efforts at developing unique physiologic assessment methodologies for use in the ED will improve quality of patient care, aid in resource allocation, improve prognostic accuracy, and objectively measure the impact of early intervention in the ED.","The landscape of critical care delivery in the emergency department (ED) is rapidly changing. The phenomena of hospital and ED overcrowding are increasing in severity and remain unresolved. In the USA there are more than 110 million ED visits per year [1] . The proportion of critically ill patients presenting to the ED and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has also risen. In California alone there was a 59% increase in the number of visits of critically ill patients to the ED from 1990 to 1999 [2] . Inpatient telemetry and ICU beds continue to be fully occupied for a significant amount of the time in many hospitals and is a primary cause of overcrowding in the ED [3, 4] . As hospital census approaches 100%, the ED unavoidably becomes a surrogate ICU. Unfortunately, resources are often limited, and critical care delivery in the ED setting is fraught with inadequate space and medical equipment and lack of staffing. Increasingly stringent nurse-patient ratios are being mandated and enforced on the inpatient ward, consequently worsening the overcrowding problem, with ED nurses often far extended over their patient care capacity. ED physicians are often overextended as well, and adequate critical care is often difficult to provide and sometimes overlooked in a busy ED. Early disease recognition and prognostication of outcome with the aid of physiologic scoring systems is a potentially valuable tool for the multitasking ED physician, and may result in improved critical care when intensive care expertise is not yet available."
Innate immune responses and neuroepithelial degeneration and regeneration in the mouse olfactory mucosa induced by intranasal administration of Poly(I:C),The pathogenesis of postviral olfactory disorder (PVOD) has not been fully elucidated. We investigated morphological changes and innate immune responses in the mouse olfactory mucosa induced by intranasal administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly(,"The olfactory mucosa has a unique feature: it is a nervous tissue as well as a part of the airway and is constantly exposed to various pathogens. The olfactory mucosa generates new olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through normal turnover, and also after injury, in order to maintain its function (Graziadei and Graziadei 1979; Schwob 2002) . The ORNs are produced by proliferation of globose basal cells with newly generated neuronal cells migrating toward the surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium during maturation. The ORNs express specific molecular markers depending on their maturational status. Immature ORNs express growthassociated protein (GAP)-43 or neuron-specific βIII tubulin (βIIIT) (Verhaagen et al. 1990 ; Lee and Pixley 1994; Roskams et al. 1998) , whereas mature ORNs express olfactory marker protein (OMP) (Monti Graziadei 1983; Kream and Margolis 1984) ."
Stable Occupancy of the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus-Encoded Deubiquitinase Blocks Viral Infection,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection can result in a severe hemorrhagic syndrome for which there are no antiviral interventions available to date. Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU's immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs. IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is an important human pathogen with a wide global distribution for which no therapeutic interventions are available. CCHFV encodes a cysteine protease belonging to the ovarian tumor (OTU) family which is involved in host immune suppression. Here we demonstrate that artificially prolonged binding of the OTU to a substrate inhibits virus infection. This provides novel insights into CCHFV OTU function during the viral replicative cycle and highlights the OTU as a potential antiviral target.","to Western Europe with the assistance of migratory birds carrying infected ticks over long distances (4, 5) ."
Triggering DTH and CTL Activity by fd Filamentous Bacteriophages: Role of CD4+ T Cells in Memory Responses,"The ability of fd bacteriophage particles to trigger different arms of the immune system has been previously shown by us with particular emphasis on the ability of phages to raise CTL responses in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that fd virions in the absence of adjuvants are able to evoke a DTH reaction mediated by antigen specific CD8+ T cells. In addition, we analyzed the induction of CTL responses in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells, and we observed that short-term secondary CTL responses were induced in the absence of CD4+ T cells while induction of long-term memory CTLs required the presence of CD4+ T lymphocytes. These results examine the cellular mechanism at the basis of fd efficiency and provide new elements to further validate the use of fd particles for eliciting and monitoring antigen-specific CTLs.","The system of antigen delivery by bacteriophage is based on the modification of the phage display technology. The filamentous bacteriophage fd is well understood at both the structural and genetic levels [1] . The capsid contains one major protein pVIII largely alpha helical which forms a shingled tubular array surrounding the single-stranded viral DNA with its N-terminal regions exposed on the viral surface. Given the large number of pVIII proteins (approximately 2700 copies per virion), the peptides displayed on pVIII, even if expressed in a lower copy number on the phage particles, remain densely represented. There is good evidence from immunoassays and NMR spectroscopy that the exposed peptides adopt a stable three-dimensional structure closely resembling that which they exhibit in the wild-type parent proteins [2] . The unexpected observation that fd filamentous bacteriophage particles are taken up and processed by the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I pathway [3] and are able to trigger cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [4, 5] , suggested that fd virions represent an efficient system for antigen delivery. Here we investigate the use of fd virions that display an epitope recognized by CD8+ T cells to mediate a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, demonstrating the ability of fd bacteriophages to elicit DTH in the absence of adjuvants."
Respiratory Syncytial Virus Outbreak in the Basic Military Training Camp of the Republic of Korea Air Force,"Objectives: An outbreak of acute febrile illness occurred in the Republic of Korea Air Force boot camp from May to July 2011. An epidemiological investigation of the causative agent, which was of a highly infective nature, was conducted.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae and is classified in the genus Pneumovirus. RSV is the most common cause of fatal acute respiratory tract infection pISSN 1975 -8375 eISSN 2233 among infants and young children [1] . Virtually every infant has been afflicted with an RSV infection by the age of 4 years, and reinfection may occur throughout life [2, 3] . Moreover, RSV infection has been encountered by almost all people in South Korea before reaching adulthood [4] . Mortality data from several studies suggest that RSV is a significant cause of death in early childhood. Such child death comes from an acute lower respiratory infection, especially following pneumococcal pneumonia or Haemophilus influenza type b [5, 6] . Recent studies indicate that RSV is an important cause of respiratory infection in elderly patients, either those with compromised immunity or inflicted with chronic illness, as well as in adult populations in a special environment, such as military personnel [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . RSV tends to be more variable and clinical manifestations seem less distinctive in adults than they are in children, and the viral cause of the infection is often unsuspected [12] [13] [14] [15] ."
Severe neurologic syndrome associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV),"They were managed separately in three different wards prior to their admission to ICU.

Diversity and roles of (t)RNA ligases,"The discovery of discontiguous tRNA genes triggered studies dissecting the process of tRNA splicing. As a result, we have gained detailed mechanistic knowledge on enzymatic removal of tRNA introns catalyzed by endonuclease and ligase proteins. In addition to the elucidation of tRNA processing, these studies facilitated the discovery of additional functions of RNA ligases such as RNA repair and non-conventional mRNA splicing events. Recently, the identification of a new type of RNA ligases in bacteria, archaea, and humans closed a long-standing gap in the field of tRNA processing. This review summarizes past and recent findings in the field of tRNA splicing with a focus on RNA ligation as it preferentially occurs in archaea and humans. In addition to providing an integrated view of the types and phyletic distribution of RNA ligase proteins known to date, this survey also aims at highlighting known and potential accessory biological functions of RNA ligases.","More recently, split tRNA (Fig. 1A , scheme c) and tri-split archaeal tRNA genes, which encode for parts of the mature domain, have been discovered [17, 18] . This type of tRNA arises from distinct transcription units that are joined by trans-splicing to yield a functional tRNA."
"Unexpected Result of Hendra Virus Outbreaks for Veterinarians, Queensland, Australia","A qualitative study of equine veterinarians and allied staff from Queensland, Australia, showed that veterinarians are ceasing equine practice because of fears related to Hendra virus. Their decisions were motivated by personal safety and legal liability concerns.","I n the mid-1990s, Hendra virus (HeV) emerged as a new pathogen that spilled over from bats to horses to humans (1, 2) . All 7 cases of HeV infection among humans in Australia occurred in Queensland. Five of these cases involved equine veterinary personnel who conducted routine necropsies or endoscopies; 3 of the 5 cases were fatal (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . In Australia, equine clinical services are mostly delivered by veterinarians working in private practice. The 3 deaths prompted government and veterinary professional agencies to promote the overhaul of infection-control measures in veterinary practice (3, 4) and increase auditing of veterinary infection-control strategies in private equine practice by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland (7) . In 2011, HeV outbreaks multiplied throughout Queensland and New South Wales, and samples from a dog were positive for HeV (8, 9) ."
Invasion thresholds and the evolution of nonequilibrium virulence,"The enterprise of virulence management attempts to predict how social practices and other factors affect the evolution of parasite virulence. These predictions are often based on parasite optima or evolutionary equilibria derived from models of host-parasite dynamics. Yet even when such models accurately capture the parasite optima, newly invading parasites will typically not be at their optima. Here we show that parasite invasion of a host population can occur despite highly nonoptimal virulence. Fitness improvements soon after invasion may proceed through many steps with wide changes in virulence, because fitness depends on transmission as well as virulence, and transmission improvements can overwhelm nonoptimal virulence. This process is highly sensitive to mutation supply and the strength of selection. Importantly, the same invasion principle applies to the evolution of established parasites, whenever mutants arise that overcome host immunity/resistance. A host population may consequently experience repeated invasions of new parasite variants and possible large shifts in virulence as it evolves in an arms race with the parasite. An experimental study of phage lysis time and examples of mammalian viruses matching some of these characteristics are reviewed.","Virulence management is a modern field whose goal is to predict the consequences of social practices on the evolution of parasite virulence . By understanding how virulence is expected to evolve, it may be possible to encourage social practices that indirectly select lower virulence. Of special concern in virulence management are environments that might favor evolutionary increases in virulence, such as leaky vaccines and high host densities (Ewald 1994; Gandon et al. 2001 Gandon et al. , 2003 ."
Laboratory Diagnosis of SARS Laboratory Diagnosis of SARS Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"The virologic test results of 415 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were examined. The peak detection rate for SARS-associated coronavirus occurred at week 2 after illness onset for respiratory specimens, at weeks 2 to 3 for stool or rectal swab specimens, and at week 4 for urine specimens. The latest stool sample that was positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was collected on day 75 while the patient was receiving intensive care. Tracheal aspirate and stool samples had a higher diagnostic yield (RT-PCR average positive rate for first 2 weeks: 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively). Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided a moderate yield (29.7%-40.0%), whereas throat washing and urine specimens showed a lower yield (17.3% and 4.5%). The collection procedures for stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least likely to transmit infection, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus detection by RT-PCR. Positive virologic test results in patient groups were associated with mechanical ventilation or death (p < 0.001), suggesting a correlation between viral load and disease severity.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) .

"Global Influenza Programme, World Health Organization","Objective To describe how pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 [A (H1N1)pdm09] activity varied during the We calculated weekly proportions of A(H1N1)pdm09-positive specimens out of all A(H1N1)pdm09-positive specimens detected during the study period for each country. We compared parameters of pandemic activity (e.g., peak A[H1N1]pdm09 weekly proportion [peak activity], number of weeks between the 5th and 95th percentiles of A(H1N1)pdm09 cumulative weekly proportion [duration of activity]) between countries in temperate and tropical-subtropical regions. We quantified the proportion of A (H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens by country and correlated it with countries' central latitudes. Results We analyzed data from 80 countries (47 temperate, 33 tropical-subtropical). The median proportion of cases identified during the peak week was higher in temperate (0Á12) than in tropical-subtropical (0Á09) regions (P < 0Á01). The median duration of activity was longer in tropical-subtropical (27 weeks) than in temperate countries (20 weeks) (P < 0Á01). In most temperate countries (98%), peak pandemic activity occurred during the fall-winter period. There was a positive correlation between country central latitude and proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens (r: 0Á76; P < 0Á01).","Seasonal influenza transmission varies throughout the world with time of year and region. 1 The mechanisms behind influenza seasonality are not well understood; however, multiple factors, including virological, immunological, environmental, and social factors likely contribute to the observed seasonal patterns of influenza transmission. 2, 3 These factors give rise to annual influenza epidemics during the winter months in Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperate climates. 4 In tropical and subtropical climates, influenza activity may be detected throughout the year, although there is increasing evidence of a notable seasonal component to influenza activity in some tropical countries. 3, 5 Pandemic influenza viruses can emerge at any time of year, but it is not clear whether the factors that drive yearly seasonal influenza transmission influence transmission of a novel virus to which the population has little immunity (resulting in increased population susceptibility, higher attack rates, and prolonged viral shedding in comparison with seasonal influenza). It has been postulated that there were seasonal variations in the transmission of pandemic influenza viruses during the 20th century, as they appeared to have had either a secondary or a tertiary wave of activity at the time of the historical influenza season. 6, 7 The A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic of 2009-2010 also demonstrated a seasonal component to transmission early during the pandemic, in the Americas. 8 For example, surveillance during April to August 2009 pointed to higher rates of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Southern Hemisphere temperate countries, where the pandemic began at the time that seasonal influenza activity was expected. 5, 9, 10 The A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study pandemic influenza transmission dynamics because there were more surveillance data from tropical and subtropical countries obtained during this pandemic than from any previous time in history. 11 The objectives of our study are to describe the transmission patterns of the A (H1N1)pdm09 virus throughout the world and to identify whether they varied in relation to geography (i.e., latitude and climatic regions) and time of year when A(H1N1)pdm09 was first detected in relation to countries' historical influenza season. This knowledge could be useful for pandemic preparedness, as it might help identify the best timing for the implementation of public health interventions or the distribution of limited supplies during a pandemic."
*World Health Organization,"The World Health Organization's recommended pandemic influenza interventions, based on limited data, vary by transmission pattern, pandemic phase, and illness severity and extent. In the pandemic alert period, recommendations include isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts, accompanied by antiviral therapy. During the pandemic period, the focus shifts to delaying spread and reducing effects through population-based measures. Ill persons should remain home when they first became symptomatic, but forced isolation and quarantine are ineffective and impractical. If the pandemic is severe, social distancing measures such as school closures should be considered. Nonessential domestic travel to affected areas should be deferred. Hand and respiratory hygiene should be routine; mask use should be based on setting and risk, and contaminated household surfaces should be disinfected. Additional research and field assessments during pandemics are essential to update recommendations. Legal authority and procedures for implementing interventions should be understood in advance and should respect cultural differences and human rights.","T his article is the second of a 2-part series that summarizes the scientific basis for nonpharmaceutical public health interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to contain or reduce transmission of pandemic influenza caused by a novel human influenza subtype; it is designed to be read in conjunction with the recommendations (1) , which are intended as guidance and not formal WHO advice (Appendix 1, available online at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1371_ app1.htm) (2) . The evidence base for recommendations is limited, consisting primarily of historical and contemporary observations, rather than controlled scientific studies. The first part of this series summarized the transmission charac-teristics of influenza viruses and the basis for interventions to reduce international spread (3) . This second part addresses measures at the national and community levels that are intended to reduce exposure of susceptible persons to the novel virus. The observations that pandemics do not infect all susceptible persons in the first wave and that subsequent waves occur suggest that preventing disease by reducing exposure is an achievable objective (3) . By limiting exposure, people who are not infected during the first wave may have an increased chance of receiving virus-specific vaccine as it becomes available. In addition, if the virus becomes less virulent over time, persons who fall ill in subsequent waves may have milder illnesses.

The Beijing municipal government took various measures to prevent the spread of SARS. As in Hong Kong (2, 3) , measures in Beijing included wearing masks and handwashing, mandatory home quarantine of persons who had contact with probable SARS patients, suspension of schools and universities for 2 weeks, restrictions on public gatherings, screening body temperatures of air travelers, discouragement of mass migration by air or train, designation of special hospitals for the treatment of SARS patients, and education on SARS transmission and personal protection. The number of new cases reported daily in Beijing were high (e.g., 39 new cases on May 14, 2003), and public and health authorities were concerned about how extensive the SARS epidemic might be and when the SARS epidemic might be brought under control if intervention measures were continued."

B cell homeostasis and follicle confines are governed by fibroblastic reticular cells HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are known to inhabit T cell-rich areas of lymphoid organs where they function to coordinate T cell and dendritic cell interactions. However, in vivo manipulation of FRCs has been limited by a dearth of genetic tools targeting this lineage. Here, using a mouse model to conditionally ablate FRCs, we demonstrate their indispensable role in anti-viral T cell responses. Unexpectedly, FRC loss also attenuated humoral immunity due to impaired B cell viability and follicular organization. Follicle-resident FRCs established a favorable niche for B lymphocytes via production of the cytokine BAFF. Thus, our study indicates that adaptive immunity requires an intact FRC network and illuminates a subset of FRCs that controls B cell homeostasis and follicle identity.","activation 1, 2 . These specialized environments are inhabited by different subsets of mesenchymal stromal cells, which are commonly viewed as serving scaffolding function for T and B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Current dogma holds that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) within the paracortical region coordinate T cell responses whereas follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the cortex support B cell responses. However, a precise understanding of how the stromal network of lymphoid organs controls adaptive immunity has been beyond our reach due to limitations in the technology for targeting each of the mesenchymal cell populations."

Human Metapneumovirus and Severity of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease,"We screened 23 children with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease and 23 children with mild RSV disease for human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Although HMPV was circulating in Connecticut, none of the 46 RSVinfected patients tested positive for HMPV. In our study population, HMPV did not contribute to the severity of RSV disease.","I n the United States, 100,000 infants and young children are hospitalized each year with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis (1) . Although the risk factors for severe RSV disease, such as prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are well defined, severe RSV disease may develop in otherwise healthy children. The pathogenesis of severe RSV disease is poorly defined."
A putative diacidic motif in the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein influences its subcellular localization and suppression of expression of co-transfected expression constructs,"The ORF6 protein is one of the eight accessory proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Numerous properties of ORF6 have been documented and this study focuses on two of these, namely, its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs and its subcellular localization to vesicular structures. Results: Using a transient transfection system, ORF6's ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs was measured in a quantitative manner. While ORF6 does not have a global effect on protein synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that it down-regulated the mRNA level of the co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Furthermore, alanine substitution of a diacidic cluster motif (aa53-56) in the ORF6 gene caused a reduction in the suppression of expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Our previous study revealed that ORF6 localized to vesicular structures in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Here, ORF6 was observed to be localized to similar vesicular structures in Vero E6 cells which have been transiently transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding for untagged ORF6. ORF6 showed partial colocalization with cellular proteins CD63 and Lamp1, suggesting that the vesicular structures may be a subpopulation of endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. The alanine substitution of the diacidic cluster motif also altered the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein, indicating a potential relationship between the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein and its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs.","An outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 which carried with it a fatality rate of 8% was traced to a novel coronavirus dubbed the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This novel coronavirus was eventually classified as a Group IIb coronavirus, a subset of the Group II coronaviruses. The subclassification was, in part, due to the presence of several accessory genes in the coronavirus which have no known homologs within the family Coronaviridae. These accessory genes have been the subject of study by many groups (for reviews, see 1 and 2) and have been assigned a plethora of physical characteristics and intracellular functions. Most importantly, almost all of these accessory genes have been shown to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, with the exception of the 3a accessory gene (3) . It has been suggested these accessory genes have subtle effects on SARS-CoV replication and may be more important for viral replication or pathogenesis in vivo."
,"Industrial hygiene specialists from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) visited hospitals and medical centers throughout Taiwan. They assisted with designing and evaluating ventilation modifications for infection control, developed guidelines for converting hospital rooms into SARS patient isolation rooms, prepared designs for the rapid conversion of a vacated military facility into a SARS screening and observation facility, assessed environmental aspects of dedicated SARS hospitals, and worked in concert with the Taiwanese to develop hospital ventilation guidelines. We describe the environmental findings and observations from this response, including the rapid reconfiguration of medical facilities during a national health emergency, and discuss environmental challenges should SARS or a SARS-like virus emerge again.","From April 29, 2003, through June 13, 2003, four industrial hygienists from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted environmental assessments of 32 hospitals and medical centers throughout Taiwan. NIOSH staff were deployed serially (a team of two initially and later, two persons at two different times) within larger teams stationed first in Taipei and then in Kaohsiung. CDC personnel worked together with Taiwanese scientists from the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH), Taiwan Center for Disease Control, National Taiwan University, College of Public Health (NTUCPH), and the Taiwan Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (Taiwan IOSH). During the peak of the SARS epidemic, CDC environmental support focused on immediate steps to isolate SARS patients, protect healthcare workers and other personnel during fever screening and patient care, and provide advice on disinfection, direct contact, and airborne precautions. As the epidemic waned, efforts turned to assessing the implementation of infection control practices, strategies for handling future SARS patients, facility designs for effective patient isolation and fever screening stations, personal protective equipment practices, and training of healthcare workers. Thirty-two hospitals or medical centers that were either accepting and treating SARS patients or were under consideration for use as dedicated SARS treatment facilities in anticipation of a more widely disseminated epidemic were visited."
EMMPRIN-Targeted Magnetic Nanoparticles for In Vivo Visualization and Regression of Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Inhibition of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation may represent a mechanism for cardiac protection against ischemia. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is highly expressed in response to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and induces activation of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. We targeted EMMPRIN with paramagnetic/fluorescent micellar nanoparticles conjugated with the EMMPRIN binding peptide AP-9 (NAP9), or an AP-9 scrambled peptide as a negative control (NAPSC). We found that NAP9 binds to endogenous EMMPRIN in cultured HL1 myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Injection of NAP9 at the time of or one day after IR, was enough to reduce progression of myocardial cell death when compared to Control and NAPSC injected mice (infarct size in NAP9 injected mice: 32%±6.59 vs Control: 46%±9.04 or NAPSC injected mice: 48%±7.64). In the same way, cardiac parameters were recovered to almost healthy levels (LVEF NAP9 63% ± 7.24 vs Control 42% ± 4.74 or NAPSC 39% ± 6.44), whereas ECM degradation was also reduced as shown by inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans have shown a signal enhancement in the left ventricle of NAP9 injected mice with respect to non-injected, and to mice injected with NAPSC. A positive correlation between CMR enhancement and Evans-Blue/TTC staining of infarct size was calculated (R:0.65). Taken together, these results point to EMMPRIN targeted nanoparticles as a new approach to the mitigation of ischemic/reperfusion injury.","Early coronary artery reperfusion is the most effective procedure for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 1 . However, reperfusion associated damage often worsens cardiac integrity, in part by eliciting an extensive inflammatory response in which proinflammatory macrophages play a pivotal role through the expression of extensive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thus contributing to ventricular injury [2] [3] ."
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever in Infants: Research Opportunities Ignored,"The age distribution of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) in infants under the age of 1 year are reported from Bangkok, Thailand, and for the first time for Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Yangon, Myanmar; and Surabaya, Indonesia. The four dengue viruses were isolated from Thai infants, all of whom were having a primary dengue infection. Progress studying the immunologically distinct infant DHF/DSS has been limited; most contemporary research has centered on DHF/DSS accompanying secondary dengue infections. In designing research results obtained in studies on a congruent animal model, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infections of kittens born to FIPV-immune queens should be considered. Research challenges presented by infant DHF/DSS are discussed.","ince World War II, the four dengue viruses (formal name: Dengue virus [DENV] ) have progressively spread geographically throughout the tropics, resulting in a global pandemic with tens of millions of infections annually, including several hundred thousand hospitalizations for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (1) . The size and spread of the dengue pandemic, the unpredictability of epidemic occurrences, and the circulation of virulent and nonvirulent strains make DHF/DSS a model for an emerging infectious disease."
Detection of SARS Coronavirus in Patients with Suspected SARS EMERGENCE OF SARS,"Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through RNA tests, serologic response, and viral culture. Of 537 specimens from patients in whom SARS was clinically diagnosed, 332 (60%) had SARS-CoV RNA in one or more clinical specimens, compared with 1 (0.3%) of 332 samples from controls. Of 417 patients with clinical SARS from whom paired serum samples were available, 92% had an antibody response. Rates of viral RNA positivity increased progressively and peaked at day 11 after onset of illness. Although viral RNA remained detectable in respiratory secretions and stool and urine specimens for >30 days in some patients, virus could not be cultured after week 3 of illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs, or sputum samples were the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness, but later in the illness viral RNA could be detected more readily in stool specimens.","I n early 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recognized as a newly emerging pneumonic disease (1) (2) (3) . A proportion of patients have watery diarrhea, usually at a later stage of the illness, suggesting that the infection may not be confined to the respiratory tract (4) . A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was implicated as the causative agent (5) (6) (7) , and the respiratory disease has been reproduced in a nonprimate animal model (8) . Hong Kong was one of the regions most affected, with >1,700 patients. Specific laboratory tests to detect viral RNA and antibody responses (5) were used to establish a cause in patients suspected to have SARS. Although virologic results for small cohorts of patients have been reported (4, 5, 9) , analysis of results of these first-generation tests in routine clinical practice has not been published previously. We report the correlation of results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescent serologic testing for SARS-CoV in 1,048 cases investigated for SARS in the first 5 weeks after the first-generation diagnostic tests became available in Hong Kong."
Detection of Spliced mRNA from Human Bocavirus 1 in Clinical Samples from Children with Respiratory Tract Infections,"Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a parvovirus associated with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children, but a causal relation has not yet been confirmed. To develop a qualitative reverse transcription PCR to detect spliced mRNA from HBoV1 and to determine whether HBoV1 mRNA correlated better with RTIs than did HBoV1 DNA, we used samples from HBoV1 DNA-positive children, with and without RTIs, to evaluate the test. A real-time reverse transcription PCR, targeting 2 alternatively spliced mRNAs, was developed. HBoV1 mRNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 33 (25%) of 133 children with RTIs but in none of 28 controls (p<0.001). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the test were good. Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 may cause RTIs, and we propose that HBoV1 mRNA could be used with benefit, instead of HBoV1 DNA, as a diagnostic target.","H uman bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a small nonenveloped virus in the Parvoviridae family. It was discovered in human respiratory samples in 2005 (1) . The virus does not grow in standard cell lines, and diagnosis has mainly been based on DNA detection with PCR. Detection of multiple viruses in HBoV1 DNA-positive airway samples from children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has been a characteristic finding in many studies (2) (3) (4) . In addition, many healthy children have tested positive for HBoV1 DNA (2, 5) ; thus whether the virus actually causes RTIs in children or is just a bystander to other infections has been debated. However, we have shown that the following 3 factors are associated with RTIs: HBoV1 viremia (HBoV1 DNAemia), a high HBoV1 DNA load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), and monodection of HBoV1 DNA in NPAs (5) . In addition, RTIs in HBoV1 DNA-positive children are associated with HBoV1 seroconversion (6) . This evidence supports a causal relation between HBoV1 and RTIs in children, but DNA-based PCR tests do not seem to diagnose HBoV1 infection accurately. We propose that detection of HBoV1-specific mRNA, as a measure of actively transcribing virus, may be a better method."
SAROTUP: Scanner and Reporter of Target-Unrelated Peptides,"As epitope mimics, mimotopes have been widely utilized in the study of epitope prediction and the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Screening the random peptide libraries constructed with phage display or any other surface display technologies provides an efficient and convenient approach to acquire mimotopes. However, target-unrelated peptides creep into mimotopes from time to time through binding to contaminants or other components of the screening system. In this study, we present SAROTUP, a free web tool for scanning, reporting and excluding possible target-unrelated peptides from real mimotopes. Preliminary tests show that SAROTUP is efficient and capable of improving the accuracy of mimotope-based epitope mapping. It is also helpful for the development of mimotope-based diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.","In 1985, Smith pioneered phage display technology, an in vitro methodology and system for presenting, selecting and evolving proteins and peptides displayed on the surface of phage virion [1] . Since then, phage display has developed rapidly and become an increasingly popular tool for both basic research such as the exploration of protein-protein interaction networks and sites [2] [3] [4] , and applied research such as the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Usually, the protein used to screen the phage display library is termed as target and the genuine partner binding to the target is called template. Peptide mimicking the binding site on the template and binding to the target is defined as mimotope, which was first introduced by Geysen et al. [11] . One type of the most frequently used targets is monoclonal antibody. In this situation, the template is the corresponding antigen inducing the antibody, and the mimotope is a mimic of the genuine epitope. In fact, the original definition of mimotope given by Geysen et al. goes ""A mimotope is defined as a molecule able to bind to the antigen combining site of an antibody molecule, not necessarily identical with the epitope inducing the antibody, but an acceptable mimic of the essential features of the epitope [11] ."" Mimotopes and the corresponding epitope are considered to have similar physicochemical properties and spatial organization. The mimicry between mimotopes and genuine epitope makes mimotopes reasonable solutions to epitope mapping, network inferring, and new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines developing."
Infl uenza Virus Infection in Nonhuman Primates,"To determine whether nonhuman primates are infected with infl uenza viruses in nature, we conducted serologic and swab studies among macaques from several parts of the world. Our detection of infl uenza virus and antibodies to infl uenza virus raises questions about the role of nonhuman primates in the ecology of infl uenza.","W orldwide, infections with infl uenza A viruses are associated with substantial illness and death among mammals and birds. Public health and research have placed major focus on understanding the pathogenicity of different infl uenza virus strains and characterizing new infl uenza vaccines. Nonhuman primates (NHPs), including macaques, have become popular experimental models for studying the pathogenesis and immunology of seasonal and emerging infl uenza viruses. NHPs readily seroconvert after experimental inoculation with seasonal infl uenza virus and have been used to test candidate vaccines for strains of human and avian origin. Like humans, macaques infected with infl uenza virus exhibit fever, malaise, nasal discharge, and nonproductive cough; virus replication can be detected in the nasal passages and respiratory tract (1, 2) . However, whether NHPs are infected with infl uenza viruses in nature remains unknown."
Macrophages of multiple sclerosis patients display deficient SHP-1 expression and enhanced inflammatory phenotype HHS Public Access,"Recent studies in mice have demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is a crucial negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, TLR signaling, and inflammatory gene expression. Furthermore, mice genetically lacking SHP-1 (me/me) display a profound susceptibility to inflammatory CNS demyelination relative to wild type mice. In particular, SHP-1 deficiency may act predominantly in inflammatory macrophages to increase CNS demyelination as SHP-1-deficient macrophages display co-expression of inflammatory effector molecules and increased demyelinating activity in me/me mice. Recently, we reported that PBMCs of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have a deficiency in SHP-1 expression relative to normal control subjects indicating that SHP-1 deficiency may play a similar role in MS as to that seen in mice. Therefore, it became essential to examine the specific expression and function of SHP-1 in macrophages from MS patients. Herein, we document that macrophages of MS patients have deficient SHP-1 protein and mRNA expression relative to those of normal control subjects. To examine functional consequences of the lower SHP-1, the activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-κB was quantified and macrophages of MS patients showed increased activation of these transcription factors. In accordance with this observation, several STAT6-, STAT1-, and NF-κB-responsive genes that mediate inflammatory demyelination were increased in macrophages of MS patients following cytokine and TLR agonist stimulation. Supporting a direct role of SHP-1 deficiency in altered macrophage function, experimental depletion of SHP-1 in normal subject macrophages resulted in an increased STAT/NF-κB activation and increased inflammatory gene expression to levels seen in macrophages of MS patients. In conclusion, macrophages of MS patients display a deficiency of SHP-1 expression, heightened activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-κB and a corresponding inflammatory profile that may be important in controlling macrophage-mediated demyelination in MS.","Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that remains a major cause of disability (1) . Several studies demonstrated that MS lesions contain multiple leukocyte cell types including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells all of which are believed to contribute to lesion formation by various distinct and interacting mechanisms (2, 3) . Among these leukocyte subsets, infiltrating macrophages have been identified as major effectors of demyelination in both MS and animal models for MS (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . In accord with these studies, it was recently described that a predominant mechanism of demyelination in MS is macrophage-mediated (12) ."
,Titers of antibodies to influenza A H2N2 virus in laboratory personnel (n = 25; 13 born before 1969) and a comparison group born before 1969 (n = 32). The age listed is that in 2005. Titers <10 were assigned a value of 1.,"To the Editor: From November 2004 to February 2005, a company contracted by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) sent influenza quality assurance samples containing live influenza A H2N2 viruses (A/Japan/305/57) to 3,748 international laboratories (1, 2) . Of these, 3,686 (98%) were located in Canada or the United States. In Germany, 6 laboratories received at least 1 of 3 samples, 2 for virus antigen detection and 1 for virus culture; all contained live virus and were formatted identically. No information on infectivity or virulence of the samples was available. Because of the absence of human-to-human influenza A H2N2 virus transmission since 1968, this situation provided the rare opportunity to investigate whether infections with this strain had occurred in any of the laboratories."
"the World Health Organization/Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network Avian Influenza Investigation Team in Vietnam Human Avian Influenza A H5N1, Vietnam Emerging Infectious Diseases • www","To evaluate risk factors for human infection with influenza A subtype H5N1, we performed a matched casecontrol study in Vietnam. We enrolled 28 case-patients who had laboratory-confirmed H5N1 infection during 2004 and 106 age-, sex-, and location-matched control-respondents. Data were analyzed by matched-pair analysis and multivariate conditional logistic regression. Factors that were independently associated with H5N1 infection were preparing sick or dead poultry for consumption <7 days before illness onset (matched odds ratio [OR] 8.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-81.99, p = 0.05), having sick or dead poultry in the household <7 days before illness onset (matched OR 4.94, 95% CI 1.21-20.20, p = 0.03), and lack of an indoor water source (matched OR 6.46, 95% CI 1.20-34.81, p = 0.03). Factors not significantly associated with infection were raising healthy poultry, preparing healthy poultry for consumption, and exposure to persons with an acute respiratory illness.","T he first indication that the current epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1 (influenza A H5N1) would have a serious effect on human heath occurred in early 2004, when influenza H5N1 was identified in a series of patients admitted to the National Pediatric Hospital in Hanoi with severe viral pneumonia (1) . Since then, large-scale and global spread of the disease in poultry has been accompanied by sporadic cases in humans. Despite many millions of avian infections and >200 human cases, knowledge of influenza H5N1 remains inadequate. Neither how these viruses are transmitted to humans nor, consequently, the most effective way to reduce the risk for infection is fully understood."
,"We evaluated the diagnostic and clinical usefulness of blood specimens to detect Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in 21 patients from the 2015 outbreak in South Korea.

MERS-CoV causes respiratory and renal illness in humans, and infection often progresses to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, or death in a subset of patients (2) . Risk factors, including patient age, preexisting health conditions, and high viral load in upper respiratory specimens, have been suggested to be related to disease severity and death (3, 4) . However, pathogenesis and clinical characteristics promoting recovery from infection or progression to serious organ failure have not been well elucidated."
,"We analyzed attack rates for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in three categories of hospital workers (nurses, nonmedical support staff, and other technical or medical staff) in all public hospitals in Hong Kong that had admitted SARS patients. Of 16 such hospitals, 14 had cases. The overall attack rate was 1.20%. Nonmedical support staff had the highest attack rate (2.73%). The odds ratios of group nonmedical support staff versus those of nurses and of nonmedical support staff versus other technical or medical staff were 2.30 (p < 0.001) and 9.78 (p < 0.001), respectively. The number of affected staff and attack rates were significantly correlated with the number of SARS patients admitted (r = 0.914 and 0.686, respectively). Affected patients were concentrated in three hospitals and in the earlier phase of the epidemic. Cleaning and clerical staff on hospital wards were at a much higher risk.","T he global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong, mainland China, and other countries from March to June in 2003. The cases in Hong Kong and mainland China accounted for 84.1% of all cases worldwide (1,755 and 5,327, respectively); the number of deaths accounted for 70.9% of all SARS-related deaths worldwide (298 and 348, respectively) (1). The first major outbreak in Hong Kong occurred in the Prince of Wales Hospital around March 10, 2003 . It resulted in 138 SARS patients, 69% of whom were hospital workers (2) . In Hong Kong, 360 hospital workers contracted SARS, a figure that represented 20.5% of all case-patients on the island (3) .

Genome-wide Analysis of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Integration and Strain in C666-1 and Raji Cells,"EBV is a key risk factor for many malignancy diseases such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). EBV integration has been reported, but its scale and impact to cancer development is remains unclear. C666-1 (NPC cell line) and Raji (BL cell line) are commonly studied EBV-positive cancer cells. A rare few EBV integration sites in Raji were found in previous research by traditional methods. To deeply survey EBV integration, we sequenced C666-1 and Raji whole genomes by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and a total of 909 breakpoints were detected in the two cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the number of integration sites was positive correlated with the total amount of chromosome structural variations (SVs) and copy number structural variations (CNVs), and most breakpoints located inside or nearby genome structural variations regions. It suggested that host genome instability provided an opportunity for EBV integration on one hand and the integration aggravated host genome instability on the other hand. Then, we respectively assembled the C666-1 and Raji EBV strains which would be useful resources for EBV-relative studies. Thus, we report the most comprehensive characterization of EBV integration in NPC cell and BL cell, and EBV shows the wide range and random integration to increase the tumorigenesis. The NGS provides an incomparable level of resolution on EBV integration and a convenient approach to obtain viral strain compared to any research technology before.","Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a major etiologic agent for malignant diseases of epithelial and lymphoid cell origin [1] [2] [3] . Despite clear evidence supporting the correlation of EBV and many malignant tumors [4, 5] , the underlying nature of EBV-host interaction remains elusive. The mode and influence of EBV integration is still not clear due to the lack of an impartial method to detect and survey genome-wide EBV integration sites, although EBV integration into host genome has been reported [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Recently, the advancement of sequencing technology [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] offers an opportunity to study the global extent and functional impact of EBV integration into the cancer genome. C666-1 [18] and Raji [19] are typical EBV positive cell lines. They are classic models to research viral-host interaction and used worldwide [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . A rare few EBV integrations sites in Raji were reported in previous research by traditional methods such as Ivyspring International Publisher genome library construction [8] and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [9] . Here we sequenced the C666-1 and Raji cell line genomes by deep (>60 coverage) whole genome sequencing to survey the entire viral integration distributions on virus and the host genome. Meanwhile, whole genome sequencing of C666-1 and Raji offered a chance to assemble their EBV genome strains, which should be useful resources for EBV-relative studies. To that end, sequencing the EBV-positive cancer cell genome provides a great solution to reveal the EBV integration distribution, the functional impact of viral integration on the host genome and the EBV genome characteristics."
"Plagues, Public Health, and Politics 1","lord mayor and aldermen of the city of London put into place a set of orders ""concerning the infection of the plague,"" which was then sweeping through the population.

Cyclophilin and Viruses: Cyclophilin as a Cofactor for Viral Infection and Possible Anti-Viral Target,"Cyclophilin (CyP) is a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase, catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues in proteins. CyP plays key roles in several different aspects of cellular physiology including the immune response, transcription, mitochondrial function, cell death, and chemotaxis. In addition to these cellular events, a number of reports demonstrated that CyP plays a critical role in the life cycle of viruses, especially human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). These two viruses are signifi cant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but current therapies are often insuffi cient. CyP may provide a novel therapeutic target for the management and/or cure of these diseases, in particular HCV.","Cyclophilin (CyP) and FK506 binding protein (FKBP) are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), enzymes that catalyze the cis-trans interconversion of peptide bonds amino terminal to proline residues (Fischer et al. 1989; Harding et al. 1989; Takahashi, 1999; Takahashi et al. 1989) . CyP and FKBP are originally identifi ed as cellular factors that bind CsA and FK506, respectively, both of which are immunosuppressants used clinically for the prevention of graft rejection following organ transplantation (Handschumacher et al. 1984; Harding et al. 1989) . Therefore, these PPIases are also called immunophilin. The action of PPIases leads to changes in protein conformation (Takahashi, 1999) , but the binding of CsA and FK506 to CyP and FKBP, respectively, inhibits the activity of these enzymes (Fischer et al. 1989; Rosen et al. 1990; Takahashi et al. 1989 ). However, the inhibition of PPIase activity by CsA and FK506 is an insuffi cient requirement for their immunosuppressive function (Bierer et al. 1990; Schreiber, 1991) . The CsA/CyP or FK506/FKBP complex, subsequently interacts with and inhibits calcineurin (CN), a phosphatase involved in the activation of the transcription factor NF-AT. Proper NF-AT function is essential for the generation of a productive T cell response (Clipstone and Crabtree, 1992; Fruman et al. 1992; Liu et al. 1991) . In the absence of immunosuppressants, CN dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NF-AT, leading to NF-AT nuclear translocation and transactivation of downstream genes participating in the immune response (Liu et al. 1992; McCaffrey et al. 1993) . CsA and FK506 prevent the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-AT leading to immunosuppression."
Genetically Diverse Coronaviruses in Wild Bird Populations of Northern England,Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a costly respiratory viral disease of chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. We detected diverse coronaviruses by PCR in wildfowl and wading birds in England. Sequence analysis showed some viruses to be related to IBV.,"Serial cross-sectional surveys of wild bird populations throughout northern England were undertaken from July 2004 through January 2007. Samples were collected from 441 individual wild birds of 42 species, including both migratory and resident species (Table 1) . Fecal samples and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from live birds that had been caught primarily for ringing purposes (8) and from dead wildfowl and corvids provided by licensed shooters. Biometric data and information concerning the location where birds had been trapped or shot were recorded (8) . Samples were placed in virus transport media (Eagle minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin [10,000 units penicillin, 10 µg streptomycin/mL] and amphotericin B [250 µg/ mL]); samples collected from the same wild bird species or genus were pooled in groups of 5 and frozen at -80°C until required."
,"To characterize genetic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmitted in the Beijing area during the epidemic outbreak of 2003, we sequenced 29 full-length S genes of SARS-CoV from 20 hospitalized SARS patients on our unit, the Beijing 302 Hospital. Viral RNA templates for the S-gene amplification were directly extracted from raw clinical samples, including plasma, throat swab, sputum, and stool, during the course of the epidemic in the Beijing area. We used a TAcloning assay with direct analysis of nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products in sequence. One hundred thirteen sequence variations with nine recurrent variant sites were identified in analyzed S-gene sequences compared with the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV. Among them, eight variant sites were, we think, the first documented. Our findings demonstrate the coexistence of Sgene sequences with and without substitutions (compared to BJ01) in samples analyzed from some patients.","A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been implicated as the causative agent of a worldwide outbreak of SARS during the first 6 months of 2003 (1) (2) (3) . From March 4 to June 18, Beijing had 2,521 cases and 192 deaths from SARS (4) . Because of the poor fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, genetic variation typically forms a heterogeneous virus pool in RNA virus populations, including coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (5, 6) . This feature makes viruses highly adaptable and contributes to difficulties in preventing and controlling viral disease. SARS-CoV, a single-stranded RNA virus, has been reported with relatively less variability in analyses of a limited number of viral isolate collections (7) (8) (9) (10) . Furthermore, no SARS-CoV quasispecies have been documented, as they have been in many other RNA viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) (11) , HIV (12) , and MHV (6) ."
Structural basis for the specificity of USP18 towards ISG15 Europe PMC Funders Group Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Discussion Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts,"Protein modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) is counteracted by ubiquitinand Ubl-proteases collectively called DUBs. In contrast to other proteases of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, USP18 shows no reactivity towards ubiquitin but specifically deconjugates the interferon induced Ubl ISG15. To identify molecular determinants for this specificity, we solved the crystal structures of mouse USP18 and of mouse USP18 in complex with mouse ISG15. USP18 was crystallized in an open and a closed conformation revealing high flexibility of the enzyme. Structural data, biochemical and mutational analysis showed that only the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15 is recognized and essential for USP18 activity. A critical hydrophobic patch in USP18 interacts with a hydrophobic region unique to ISG15 providing evidence that ISG15 specificity of USP18 is mediated by a small interaction interface. Our results may provide the structural basis for the development of new drugs modulating ISGylation.","the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes including protein stability, DNA repair, cell cycle control, intracellular trafficking and antiviral defense. ISG15 was the first Ubl identified1 and is composed of two ubiquitin-like domains connected by a short linker region2. Covalent linkage of ISG15 (ISGylation) is mediated by the consecutive action of the E1 activating enzyme Ube1L3, the E2 conjugating enzyme UbCH84,5 and a few E3 ligases, including mouse HERC6 and human HERC56-9, which account for the conjugation of most substrates in mice and humans, respectively. All components of the ligation process are strongly induced by type I IFN10."
Epidemiology and Prevention of Pediatric Viral Respiratory Infections in Health-Care Institutions,"Nosocomial viral respiratory infections cause considerable illness and death on pediatric wards. Common causes of these infections include respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. Although primarily a community pathogen, rhinovirus also occasionally results in hospitalization and serious sequelae. This article reviews effective infection control interventions for these three pathogens, as well as ongoing controversies.","Infection control professionals worldwide rely on the Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals promulgated by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1) . This widely venerated document has assumed almost ecclesiastical authority. The guidelines have been framed carefully to reflect current evidence and opinion on the modes of transmission of nosocomial pathogens, and it is this rigorous evidence-based process that insures their credibility. However, scrutiny of guidelines addressing the nosocomial spread of viral pathogens reveals the fragile data on which many of the recommendations are based."
"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Use and Interpretation of a Rapid Respiratory Syncytial Virus Antigen Detection Test Among Infants Hospitalized in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit -Wisconsin, March 2015","On March 25, 2015, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health was notified of a possible respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection outbreak among infants hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). On March 23, the index patient (neonate A), aged 3 days, had feeding intolerance and apnea. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected from neonate A was tested using a single-manufacturer rapid RSV antigen detection test (RRADT) at the hospital laboratory; the result was positive. The following day, because of concern about the possibility of more widespread RSV infection, RRADT was used to test nasopharyngeal swab specimens from neonate B, aged 1 month, who had resided in a different hospital room in the NICU and had developed an increased oxygen requirement, apnea, and poor feeding that day, as well as from two asymptomatic neonates who were hospitalized in the same room with neonate A; all three were positive. Later that day, nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the remaining 16 asymptomatic NICU patients were tested using the same RRADT; seven tests were positive, making a total of 11 positives. All 20 RRADTs were performed at the hospital laboratory.","On March 25, 2015, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health was notified of a possible respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection outbreak among infants hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Partitioning of Viruses in Wastewater Systems and Potential for Aerosolization,"To gain insight into the potential for aerosolization of viruses in wastewater systems, we investigated the partitioning of MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages in synthetic sludge and anaerobically digested sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. We evaluated partitioning among the liquid, solids, and material surfaces of porcelain, concrete, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene. In all cases, at least 94% of the virions partitioned into the liquid fraction. In real sludge, no more than 0.8% of virions partitioned to the solids and no more than 6% to the material surface. Both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of concrete and polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain or PVC. Partitioning of viruses in wastewater among the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does not appear to mitigate the potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the virus remains in the liquid phase.","The Ebola outbreak in 2014 raised new questions about routes of transmission of the disease. Aerosol transmission is theoretically possible but remains unproven. 1 Experiments with non-human primates have shown that inhalation exposure to Ebola virus can lead to fatal infection. 2−4 Patients with Ebola virus disease expel large volumes of diarrhea, 5, 6 which may contain up to 10 7 genome copies of virus per milliliter, 7 and toilets, sewer systems, and wastewater treatment plants are known to produce bioaerosols. 8−19 The combination of these factors indicates that the potential exists for aerosolization of Ebola virus from wastewater systems. Sanitation facilities that are common in developed countries, such as pressure-assisted flush toilets and aeration basins, may provide opportunities for aerosolization of the virus that do not exist in western Africa, where the vast majority of cases of Ebola virus disease have occurred."
"Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Health Services Research and Development Service CIN 13-416","Objective: To categorize and describe the public health informatics (PHI) and global health informatics (GHI) literature between 2012 and 2014. Methods: We conducted a semi-systematic review of articles published between January 2012 and September 2014 where information and communications technologies (ICT) was a primary subject of the study or a main component of the study methodology. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups. Results: A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications. The development of adequate infrastructure to support ICT remains a challenge, although we identified a small but growing set of articles that measure the impact of ICT on clinical outcomes. Discussion: There is evidence of growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. Yet the articles also illuminate the need for more primary research studies on what works and what does not as both searches yielded small numbers of primary, empirical articles. Conclusion: While the body of knowledge around PHI and GHI continues to mature, additional studies of higher quality are needed to generate the robust evidence base needed to support continued investment in ICT by governmental health agencies.","While they share much in common with other branches within the broader field of biomedical informatics [1] , public health and global health informatics differ in their scope and applications. Public health informatics (PHI; also known as public health & epidemiology informatics in Europe) focuses on the application of information and communications technologies (ICT) to promote the health of populations rather than individual patients. In addition, PHI focuses on disease prevention rather than treatment and typically operates within a governmental rather than private environment [2] . PHI is generally organized and conducted by governmental public health authorities, which is most often a nation's 'ministry of health' except in the United States where public health practice is dispersed among a federation of local, state and federal health agencies."
,"Microbiologic infections acquired from animals, known as zoonoses, pose a risk to public health. An estimated 60% of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic. Of these pathogens, >71% have wildlife origins. These pathogens can switch hosts by acquiring new genetic combinations that have altered pathogenic potential or by changes in behavior or socioeconomic, environmental, or ecologic characteristics of the hosts. We discuss causal factors that infl uence the dynamics associated with emergence or reemergence of zoonoses, particularly in the industrialized world, and highlight selected examples to provide a comprehensive view of their range and diversity.","environmental changes, new and recurring diseases are likely to continue to emerge."
Ring Vaccination and Smallpox Control,"We present a stochastic model for the spread of smallpox after a small number of index cases are introduced into a susceptible population. The model describes a branching process for the spread of the infection and the effects of intervention measures. We discuss scenarios in which ring vaccination of direct contacts of infected persons is sufficient to contain an epidemic. Ring vaccination can be successful if infectious cases are rapidly diagnosed. However, because of the inherent stochastic nature of epidemic outbreaks, both the size and duration of contained outbreaks are highly variable. Intervention requirements depend on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), for which different estimates exist. When faced with the decision of whether to rely on ring vaccination, the public health community should be aware that an epidemic might take time to subside even for an eventually successful intervention strategy.","R ecently, concerns about a bioterror attack with the smallpox virus or other infectious disease agents have risen (1, 2) . While new vaccines with fewer adverse consequences are being developed (3), the existing vaccines, which have potential side effects and may be lethal, are the only vaccines available (4, 5) . In the United States during the recent voluntary smallpox vaccination program, a limited number of healthcare workers volunteered for vaccination because of the risks associated with vaccination and the low for infection (6) . If an outbreak occurs, vaccination strategies include ring vaccination around diagnosed cases of smallpox or a mass vaccination to begin as soon as the first cases are diagnosed. Without natural smallpox infections, practical experience with ring vaccination against smallpox cannot be gained; accounts of the vaccination programs that eradicated smallpox in the 1970s are the only source of information (7) . Combined with information collected during the last decades of smallpox circulation, mathematical modeling offers a tool to explore various vaccination scenarios if an outbreak occurs (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) ."
Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source Air pollution and case fatality of SARS in the People's Republic of China: an ecologic study,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has claimed 349 lives with 5,327 probable cases reported in mainland China since November 2002. SARS case fatality has varied across geographical areas, which might be partially explained by air pollution level.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging viral infectious disease, which has claimed 349 lives with 5,327 probable cases reported in mainland China since November 2002. [1, 2] SARS case fatality has varied across geographical areas with higher fatality found in the northern areas of China. The SARS case fatalities of Beijing and Tianjin, two cities in the northern part of China, were 7.66% and 8%, respectively; while the case fatality rate of Guangdong, a province in the southern part of china was only 3.84%. Although sex ratio, age distribution, socioeconomic level, availability of health facilities, and clinical practices might be responsible for the geographical difference, air pollution could be an important determinant. Air pollution has been linked to acute respiratory inflammation, asthma attack, COPD exacerbation, and death from cardiorespiratory diseases by various studies. [3] [4] [5] [6] In this study, the relationship between air pollution and SARS case fatality was explored via an ecologic study design."
Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials Detection of hepatitis C virus in the nasal secretions of an intranasal drug-user,"Background: One controversial source of infection for hepatitis C virus (HCV) involves the sharing of contaminated implements, such as straws or spoons, used to nasally inhale cocaine and other powdered drugs. An essential precondition for this mode of transmission is the presence of HCV in the nasal secretions of intranasal drug users.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of 170 million chronic infections. HCVinduced liver disease is the most common indication for liver transplantation and it has emerged as a leading cause of death among hospitalized HIV-infected patients treated during the HAART era [1] . Transmission of HCV is known to occur through contact with contaminated blood, most notably in the context of injection drug use, transfusion of blood products prior to 1992, chronic hemodialysis, occupational exposure to blood, and nosocomial and perinatal exposure. In addition, several studies have reported low levels of suspected sexual and household transmission of HCV [2] ."
"Fact-finding Survey of Nosocomial Infection Control in Hospitals in Kathmandu, Nepal-A Basis for Improvement","The purpose of this study was to investigate the actual conditions of nosocomial infection control in Kathmandu City, Nepal as a basis for the possible contribution to its improvement. The survey was conducted at 17 hospitals and the methods included a questionnaire, site visits and interviews. Nine hospitals had manuals on nosocomial infection control, and seven had an infection control committee (ICC). The number of hospitals that met the required amount of personal protective equipment preparation was as follows: gowns (13), gloves (13), surgical masks (12). Six hospitals had carried out in-service training over the past one year, but seven hospitals responded that no staff had been trained. Eight hospitals were conducting surveillance based on the results of bacteriological testing. The major problems included inadequate management of ICC, insufficient training opportunities for hospital staff, and lack of essential equipment. Moreover, increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics was recognized as a growing issue. In comparison with the results conducted in 2003 targeting five governmental hospitals, a steady improvement was observed, but further improvements are needed in terms of the provision of high quality medical care. Particularly, dissemination of appropriate manuals, enhancement of basic techniques, and strengthening of the infection control system should be given priority.","Recently, nosocomial infections have become a global concern recognized as a major patient safety issue. They not only cause a significant burden on patients but also lower the quality of medical care. In addition, prolonged hospitalization due to nosocomial infections increases costs and unnecessary expenses for the hospital [1, 2] . In the healthcare setting, particularly in developed countries, various measures including the organization of infection control teams (ICTs), preparation of manuals, strengthening of surveillance systems, and training of staff have been taken to assure effective control. However, it is only some decades ago that importance was attached to nosocomial infection control and effective measures were employed, even in developed countries [3] ."
Genetics and Pathogenesis of Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus,"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is endemic in feral cat populations and cat colonies, frequently preceding outbreaks of fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FCoV exhibits 2 biotypes: the pathogenic disease and a benign infection with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Uncertainty remains regarding whether genetically distinctive avirulent and virulent forms coexist or whether an avirulent form mutates in vivo, causing FIP. To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Viral sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and nonstructural protein 7b genes. These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations. In addition, 5 membrane protein amino acid residues with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with FIP. These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent FIP-associated FCoV.","F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an uncommon, fatal, progressive, and immune-augmented disease of cats caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Although FCoV is common in most domestic, feral, and nondomestic cat populations worldwide (seroprevalence 20%-100%), FIP will develop in <10% of FCoV seropositive cats (1) (2) (3) (4) . FIP tends to occur most frequently in cats <2 years of age or, less commonly, in geriatric cats (4, 5) . The clinical manifestations of FCoV infection can be either a pathogenic disease, FIP (cases infected with feline infectious perito-nitis virus [FIPV] ) and, more commonly, a benign, or mild enteric infection (feline enteric coronavirus [FECV] asymptomatic) (6, 7) . Specific genetic determinants of these clinical outcomes have yet to be discovered. There is no effective treatment, vaccine, or diagnostic protocol that can discriminate the avirulent FECV from FIPV."
Sustainability of High-Level Isolation Capabilities among US Ebola Treatment Centers DISPATCHES,"To identify barriers to maintaining and applying capabilities of US high-level isolation units (HLIUs) used during the Ebola virus disease outbreak, during 2016 we surveyed HLIUs. HLIUs identified sustainability challenges and reported the highly infectious diseases they would treat. HLIUs expended substantial resources in development but must strategize models of sustainability to maintain readiness.","D uring the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, 56 hospitals in the United States were designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Ebola treatment centers (ETCs). ETCs added national capacity to care for patients with highly infectious diseases (HIDs); that is, hazardous, easily transmissible, life-threatening illnesses with limited treatment options, such as EVD and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (1) . ETCs were equipped with the clinical care resources, specialized infrastructure, and trained staff to safely manage and treat a person suspected or confirmed to have EVD (2) . After the initial designation, 1 ETC in each US Department of Health and Human Services region was selected as a Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogens Treatment Center (RESPTC) capable of managing HIDs for extended periods (3) ."
A method of processing nasopharyngeal swabs to enable multiple testing HHS Public Access,Objective-To develop a method to perform multiple tests on single nasopharyngeal (NP) swab.,"A major challenge in clinical and translational research is the collection of multiple biological samples from a single patient; this is especially true in children. Although obtaining a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab is minimally invasive, performance of multiple tests usually requires obtaining multiple specimens. Although some investigators have reported using nasal samples for multiple tests, (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) we are not aware of any studies that have used a single NP swab to evaluate viral, bacterial and host parameters."
DISPATCHES,"We analyzed data for 170 patients in South Korea who had laboratory-confirmed infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. A longer incubation period was associated with a reduction in the risk for death (adjusted odds ratio/1-day increase in incubation period 0.83, 95% credibility interval 0.68-1.03).","T he incubation period of an infectious disease is the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear (1). This major biological parameter is part of the case definition and is used to determine duration of quarantine and inform policy decisions when mathematical modeling is used (2) . Incubation periods vary from person to person, and their distribution tends to be right-skewed and unimodal (3) . Variability in incubation periods for infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been described (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Previous studies have not examined whether the length of the incubation period in a person has any correlation with subsequent clinical outcomes."

Cost effective strategies for completing the Interactome HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Comprehensive protein interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans. A key step in these projects is estimating the time, cost, and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map. Here, we model the cost of interaction map completion across a spectrum of experimental designs. We show that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion. We explore designs for reducing this cost substantially, including prioritization of protein pairs, probability thresholding, and interaction prediction. The best designs lower cost by four-fold overall and >100-fold in early stages of mapping. We demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in Drosophila, in which we map 450 high-confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates, versus thousands of plates expected using current designs. This study provides a framework for assessing the feasibility of interaction mapping projects and for future efforts to increase their efficiency.","Mapping a complete gene or protein network evokes similar challenges and considerations as mapping a complete genome sequence. In the case of the human and model genome projects, large-scale sequencing efforts were accompanied by a series of feasibility studies27,28 which used mathematical formulations and pilot projects to explore strategies for genome assembly and the work required for each. In the case of interaction networks, similar feasibility studies are just beginning29-31. Some of the questions to be addressed are: What is the cost of completing an interactome map and what is the best strategy for minimizing that cost? Given practical cost constraints, how can the quality and coverage of interaction data be maximized? How many independent assay types are needed? How should direct pairwise tests for interaction be combined with pooled screening? What is the effect of the test sensitivity on the final cost? How should interaction predictions be incorporated, and what is their effect on the mapping cost? Which specific improvements to experimental and computational methods are likely to have the largest effect?"
SARS-associated Coronavirus Replication in Cell Lines SARS-associated Coronavirus Replication in Cell Lines,"Given the potential for laboratory-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections, we must know which cell lines are susceptible to the virus. We investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research. After infection with SARS-CoV, cells were observed for cytopathic effects, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure ongoing viral replication. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was also used as a confirmatory test. The study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of SARS-CoV and confirmed the susceptibility of 4 cell lines previously reported. This study shows that SARS-CoV can be isolated in several cell lines commonly used for diagnostic or research purposes. It also shows that SARS-CoV can achieve high titers in several cell lines, sometimes in the absence of specific cytopathic effects.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first observed in 2002 when cases of a life-threatening atypical pneumonia occurred in Guangdong Province, China (1) . A novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV, was quickly identified as the etiologic agent (1, 2) . Although the origins of the virus have not been established, evidence suggests that it is an animal virus that was recently transmitted to humans (3) . Several wildlife species consumed as delicacies in southern China, including Himalayan masked palm civets, Chinese ferret badgers, and raccoon dogs, possess antibodies consistent with natural infection with related CoVs (4) ."
,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In a longitudinal cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence of virus in bodily excretions and time of seroconversion in discharged patients with SARS. Conjunctival, throat, stool, and urine specimens were collected weekly from 64 patients and tested for SARS-CoV RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction; serum samples were collected weekly and tested for SARS-CoV antibody with indirect enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence assay. In total, 126 conjunctival, 124 throat swab, 116 stool, and 124 urine specimens were analyzed. Five patients had positive stool samples, collected in weeks 5-9. Two patients seroconverted in weeks 7 and 8; the others were seropositive at the first serum sample collection. In this study, 5 (7.8%) of 64 patients continued to shed viral RNA in stool samples only, for up to week 8 of illness. Most seroconversions occurred by week 6 of illness.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a newlydefined condition identified in March 2003, is caused by the novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is believed to have originated in Guangdong Province, China, with subsequent spread to other cities and countries. By August 15, 2003 , a total of 30 countries had reported cases of SARS; 5 countries had local transmission. Approximately 8,500 cases were reported and at least 916 deaths (1) . Singapore's index case-patient was a 22year-old woman admitted to the hospital for atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 ; she had returned from a trip to Hong Kong on February 25. An additional 237 cases were identified and 33 deaths. The date of onset of illness of the last patient was May 5, 2003 ."
Clinical Trials and Novel Pathogens: Lessons Learned from SARS,"During the recent global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), thousands of patients received treatments such as ribavirin and corticosteroids. Despite this, no controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of these agents were conducted. If a second global SARS outbreak occurred, clinicians would not have controlled data on which to base therapeutic decisions. We discuss the unique methodologic and logistical challenges faced by researchers who attempt to conduct controlled trials of therapeutic agents during an outbreak of a novel or unknown infectious pathogen. We draw upon our own experience in attempting to conduct a randomized controlled trial of ribavirin therapy for SARS and discuss the lessons learned. Strategies to facilitate future clinical trials during outbreaks of unknown or novel pathogens are also presented.","T he recognition of SARS as a transmissible disease prompted international efforts to identify its cause and control its spread. The success of these efforts has been dramatic, with the identification of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the control of SARS outbreaks in all affected countries (1) (2) (3) (4) . An evidence-based approach to managing SARS is still lacking, however, as no controlled clinical data are available to justify any of the treatments used. If SARS reemerges, clinicians will have little evidence on which to base treatment decisions. Could clinical trials have been conducted during the global outbreak? If so, what steps need to be taken to ensure that such trials are implemented appropriately the next time a similar event occurs?"
"Novel Circovirus from Mink, China","A long-established epidemic of enteritis, caused by an unidentified pathogen distinct from parvovirus, has now been recognized in mink. In 2013, we identified a novel circovirus by degenerate PCR and fully sequenced its genome. This virus differs substantially from currently known members of the genus Circovirus and represents a new species.","M embers of the family Circoviridae are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses with diameters of 16-26 nm and a small, circular, single-stranded DNA genome (the smallest known autonomously replicating viral genome) (1). The family Circoviridae is currently composed of 2 genera, Gyrovirus and Circovirus, each of which has been associated with diseases in birds, pigs, and dogs (1,2). Among birds, circovirus infections have been associated with beak abnormalities, lethargy, and anorexia in parrots and pigeons and production losses and death in geese (3, 4) . Among pigs, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) causes respiratory and enteric diseases, dermatitis, and reproductive problems, resulting in major economic losses to the pork industry (5, 6) . A proposed new genus (Cyclovirus) within the family Circoviridae consists of cycloviruses. Genomes of cycloviruses have been identified in human and chimpanzee feces and human cerebrospinal fluid (7, 8) . Recently, circoviruses have been found in bats and have shown high genetic diversity (9,10). We describe a novel circovirus in mink (mustelids). This mink circovirus (MiCV) was found in the liver, digestive tract, and fecal specimens from mink with diarrhea as their main clinic sign."

Acta vet. scand. 2003, 44, 145-152.","Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan parasite causing gastrointestinal disease and diarrhoea in a variety of animal species including cattle, sheep and man. The first report on bovine cryptosporidiosis was published in 1971, when C. parvum parasites were identified in the faeces from an 8-monthold heifer with chronic diarrhoea (Panciera et al. 1971 ). Today C. parvum is recognised as an important infection in young calves. The most prominent finding in an infected calf is diarrhoea, sometimes accompanied by depression, inappetence, fever, dehydration and/or poor condition. The calf most often recovers spontaneously within 1-2 weeks even though there is a large variation between individuals in how they respond to and recover from infection (Tzipori et al. 1983 , O'Donoghue 1995 . Concomi-tant infection with other enteric pathogens can aggravate the clinical signs and prolong the duration of disease (O'Donoghue 1995) . C. parvum is transmitted as microscopic oocysts that are excreted in the faeces from infected animals. Finding oocysts in diarrhoeic faeces is indicative of C. parvum being the cause of the disease. During the first two weeks of infection a calf can shed millions of oocysts (Fayer et al. 1998 , Uga et al. 2000 which ensures efficient dissemination of the parasite. The intestinal flagellate Giardia intestinalis (synonyms G. duodenalis and G. lamblia) has a global distribution and is a common protozoan parasite in many animal species and in man (Xiao 1994 , Kulda & Nohýnková 1995 . In calves it can cause diarrhoea, malabsorption and growth retardation. However, the severity of disease is highly variable and many G. intestinalis infections are asymptomatic (Xiao 1994 , Quílez et al. 1996 ). An infected individual sheds microscopic cysts with the faeces and in calves intermittent cyst shedding can continue for several weeks (Xiao & Herd 1994) . Infections with rotavirus and coronavirus are well-known causes of acute diarrhoea in young calves, usually occurring in calves at 1-3 weeks of age (Mebus et al. 1973 , Saif et al. 1994 . The clinical picture is similar to that of cryptosporidiosis and comprises diarrhoea, depression, anorexia and mild fever. In several surveys, rotavirus has been the most commonly detected infectious agent in bovine neonatal enteritis (Snodgrass et al. 1986 , Saif et al. 1994 . Other infectious agents -Eimeria spp, bredavirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, parvovirus, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens -are also reported as enteric pathogens in neonatal calf diarrhoea (Tzipori 1981) . Bovine viral diarrhoea virus has the ability to cause immunosuppression and enhance the severity of calf diseases, including neonatal calf diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99+ causes diarrhoea in very young calves and the clinical outcome may be fatal. A rapid and extensive loss of body water and electrolytes can cause severe weakness, recumbence and hypothermia (Butler & Clarke 1994) . From a zoonotic point of view the most interesting of the calf enteric pathogens are C. parvum, G. intestinalis and Salmonella spp. However, Salmonella spp. are uncommon in Swedish dairy herds as a result of many years of intensive control measures (Wahlström 2001) . Information about the presence of C. parvum infection in Swedish cattle is limited. In a study comprising 279 dairy calves aged 0-14 days, 5% of the calves harboured C. parvum (Viring et al. 1993) . In a more recent investigation, C. parvum oocysts were detected in 3 out of 14 herds with calf diarrhoea problems (de Verdier Klingenberg & Svensson 1998) . Bovine G. intestinalis infection has been reported in Sweden (Anonymous 2001) but the prevalence and importance of giardiosis in the Swedish cattle population is not known. The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence and significance of C. parvum and G. intestinalis in Swedish dairy calves in comparison with rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli K99+."
"Viral Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes: Generation, Mutagenesis, and Removal of Mini-F Sequences","Maintenance and manipulation of large DNA and RNA virus genomes had presented an obstacle for virological research. BAC vectors provided a solution to both problems as they can harbor large DNA sequences and can efficiently be modified using wellestablished mutagenesis techniques in Escherichia coli. Numerous DNA virus genomes of herpesvirus and pox virus were cloned into mini-F vectors. In addition, several reverse genetic systems for RNA viruses such as members of Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae could be established based on BAC constructs. Transfection into susceptible eukaryotic cells of virus DNA cloned as a BAC allows reconstitution of recombinant viruses. In this paper, we provide an overview on the strategies that can be used for the generation of virus BAC vectors and also on systems that are currently available for various virus species. Furthermore, we address common mutagenesis techniques that allow modification of BACs from single-nucleotide substitutions to deletion of viral genes or insertion of foreign sequences. Finally, we review the reconstitution of viruses from BAC vectors and the removal of the bacterial sequences from the virus genome during this process.","For many years, genetic manipulation of the genomes of large DNA viruses was extremely tedious and dependent on rare recombination events in susceptible eukaryotic cells. Infected cells were transfected with plasmids or linear DNA fragments containing a selection marker flanked by sequences homologous to the target locus. This process allowed the deletion or mutation of the gene of interest in the virus genome. However, purification of resulting recombinant viruses was laborious and often required several passages. Deletion of essential viral genes was usually not feasible due to the strong selection for progeny viruses that efficiently replicate in vitro. Constant selective pressure during serial virus passage often resulted in compensatory mutations in the viral genome. To overcome the obstacle of essentiality, transcomplementing cell lines were generated that would compensate for the absence of the gene in the virus context. This solution would work in most cases but was not always possible due to the toxicity of some viral proteins. A solution to the problems was the maintenance and modification of virus genomes in bacteria where the accuracy of the bacterial polymerase allows clonal maintenance of viral sequences in E. coli. As viral promoters are not functional in bacteria, there is no selective pressure on the virus genome in E. coli. In rare cases, high-copy plasmids containing virus sequences can be toxic for bacteria; however, this problem could also be overcome by the use of single or low-copy vectors, such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Another advantage of BAC replicons is the high capacity of up to 300 kbp that is required for the cloning of large DNA and RNA virus genomes. Maintenance and faithful replication of the BAC construct in E. coli are facilitated by components encoded in the minimal fertility factor replicon (mini-F), the backbone of the BAC vector. Replication of the BAC is initiated at the origin of replication S (oriS) and stringently regulated by the repE and repF gene products encoded in the mini-F. Resulting copies of the replicon are subsequently allocated to the two daughter cells. This dynamic process is facilitated by the mini-F-encoded proteins SopA and SopB and the centromere region sopC [1] . Bacterial antibiotic resistance cassettes present in the BAC vector backbone allow the 2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology selection in E. coli. Besides the essential sequences required for replication and maintenance, many BAC vectors harbor a variety of expression cassettes that allow visualization of BAC-containing sequences in transfected cells selection in mammalian cells and, hence, ease the generation of recombinant viruses that contain the mini-F."
"A live, impaired-fidelity coronavirus vaccine protects in an aged, immunocompromised mouse model of lethal disease HHS Public Access Author manuscript","Live-attenuated RNA virus vaccines are efficacious but subject to reversion to virulence. Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (ExoN) that likely functions in RNA proofreading. In this study, we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of SARS-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged, and immunocompromised mouse models of human SARS. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or longterm persistent infection in vivo. Our approach represents a strategy with potential for broad applications for the stable attenuation of coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses.","the 21 st century. Like influenza, coronaviruses (CoVs) have a strong history of host-shifting and cross-species transmission 5, 6 . In addition to the 2002 emergence of SARS-CoV, which caused 50% mortality in aged populations, several other human CoVs, such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E, likely emerged from animal reservoirs within the past 200 years 7, 8 . The sudden appearance of new respiratory viral pathogens from animals dramatically underscores the need for novel, broadly applicable platforms that rapidly and rationally attenuate emerging zoonoses, especially to protect vulnerable populations in future outbreaks."
Potential for Introduction of Bat-Borne Zoonotic Viruses into the EU: A Review,"Bat-borne viruses can pose a serious threat to human health, with examples including Nipah virus (NiV) in Bangladesh and Malaysia, and Marburg virus (MARV) in Africa. To date, significant human outbreaks of such viruses have not been reported in the European Union (EU). However, EU countries have strong historical links with many of the countries where NiV and MARV are present and a corresponding high volume of commercial trade and human travel, which poses a potential risk of introduction of these viruses into the EU. In assessing the risks of introduction of these bat-borne zoonotic viruses to the EU, it is important to consider the location and range of bat species known to be susceptible to infection, together with the virus prevalence, seasonality of viral pulses, duration of infection and titre of virus in different bat tissues. In this paper, we review the current scientific knowledge of all these factors, in relation to the introduction of NiV and MARV into the EU.","Bat-borne viruses with pandemic potential have been identified as the origin of a number of recent human disease outbreaks. Examples include the paramyxoviruses Nipah virus (NiV) in Malaysia and [2] and the filoviruses Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg viruses (MARV) in Africa [3] . Bats have also been linked with the more recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4, 5] . Nipah Virus, in particular, has been suggested to have pandemic potential as it is capable of limited human-human transmission and RNA viruses in general have particularly high mutation rates. A human-adapted strain of NiV, were it to emerge in Asia, could spread rapidly due to high population densities and global interconnectedness [1] . A large, and still increasing, number of different viruses have been isolated from bats, many of which are asymptomatic in the host and are closely related to human pathogens. These viruses have the potential for cross-species transmission (i.e., -spillover‖) to other mammalian species, for example, MARV in monkeys [6] and NiV in pigs [7] , and to directly or indirectly infect humans [2] . A recent paper describes the infection of a wildlife biologist with a novel paramyxovirus during a field trip to South Sudan and Uganda [8] . A recent study found that bats have, on average, significantly more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, which are also known to host a large range of viruses [9] . Additionally, the authors estimated that viruses had a broader host range in bats, averaging 4.51 host species per virus. Bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in various bat species across Africa, Australia, South America and Asia and recently the detection and characterization of paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats has also been reported [10] . Further to this, recent evidence places bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae [11] . Bat species can have very broad geographic ranges [9, 12] and multiple species can share the same habitats and even roost sites [13] . Studies of Pteropus bats in Australia and Asia found they could travel hundreds of kilometers between roosting sites with their home ranges extending across national boundaries and over sea [14, 15] ."
Use of the Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Implant for the Treatment of Noninfectious Posterior Uveitis: 3-Year Results of a Randomized Clinical Trial in a Predominantly Asian Population,"Introduction: The fluocinolone acetonide (FA) intravitreal implant 0.59 mg (Retisert Ò , Bausch ? Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA) provides sustained release of FA directly to the vitreous cavity over a prolonged period of time. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 0.59-and 2.1-mg FA","The term 'uveitis' comprises a group of intraocular inflammatory conditions that directly or indirectly affects the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, collectively known as the uveal tract, as well as the retina, optic nerve, and vitreous [1] [2] [3] [4] . In most cases, the etiology of uveitis is unknown; however, it can be associated with autoimmune disease, infection (viral, fungal, or parasitic), or trauma [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] ."
Metagenomics for pathogen detection in public health,"Traditional pathogen detection methods in public health infectious disease surveillance rely upon the identification of agents that are already known to be associated with a particular clinical syndrome. The emerging field of metagenomics has the potential to revolutionize pathogen detection in public health laboratories by allowing the simultaneous detection of all microorganisms in a clinical sample, without a priori knowledge of their identities, through the use of next-generation DNA sequencing. A single metagenomics analysis has the potential to detect rare and novel pathogens, and to uncover the role of dysbiotic microbiomes in infectious and chronic human disease. Making use of advances in sequencing platforms and bioinformatics tools, recent studies have shown that metagenomics can even determine the whole-genome sequences of pathogens, allowing inferences about antibiotic resistance, virulence, evolution and transmission to be made. We are entering an era in which more novel infectious diseases will be identified through metagenomics-based methods than through traditional laboratory methods. The impetus is now on public health laboratories to integrate metagenomics techniques into their diagnostic arsenals.","Traditional pathogen detection methods in public health infectious disease surveillance rely upon the identification of agents that are already known to be associated with a particular clinical syndrome.

IFITM3 directly engages and shuttles incoming virus particles to lysosomes,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) (1, 2 and 3) have emerged as important innate immune effectors that prevent diverse virus infections in vertebrates. However, the cellular mechanisms and live cell imaging of these small membrane proteins have been challenging to evaluate during viral entry of mammalian cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated IFITM-mutant cell lines, we demonstrate that human IFITM1, 2 and 3 act cooperatively and function in dosedependent fashion in interferon-stimulated cells. Through site-specific fluorophore tagging and live cell imaging studies, we show IFITM3 is on endocytic vesicles that fuse with incoming virus particles and enhances the trafficking of this pathogenic cargo to lysosomes. IFITM3 trafficking is specific to restricted viruses, requires S-palmitoylation and is abrogated with loss-of-function","Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs, 1, 2 and 3) have emerged as important gatekeepers of pathogen infection in vertebrates. 1 Initial siRNA knockdown studies of IFITM3 increased the susceptibility of mammalian cell lines to influenza A virus (IAV), and overexpression showed that IFITM1, 2 and 3 could also inhibit infection by other strains of IAV as well as flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV), with IFITM3 being the most active against IAV. 2 In addition to IFITM1, 2 and 3, humans have two other IFITM isoforms (5 and 10) and mice have four others (5, 6, 7 and 10) that are not induced by IFNs. [1] [2] [3] Subsequent studies have demonstrated that IFITM1, 2 and 3 are active against many other viruses, 1, 3 including Ebola virus (EBOV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), non-enveloped mammalian reovirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). 4, 5 IFITMs are, however, not active against DNA viruses such as papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus and adenovirus 6 and even promote human coronavirus OC43 infection 7, 8 . SiRNA knockdown of IFITM1, 2 and 3 together has also been reported to increase Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in macrophages. 9 Moreover, IFITM3 was shown to associate with Mtb in late endosomal compartments and was shown to restrict Mtb by imaging flow cytometry. 9 IFITMs are active in multiple mammalian cell types, including primary CD8+ T cells and respiratory DCs directly involved in adaptive immunity to IAV. 10 Notably, ifitm3−/− mice are more susceptible to infection by IAV. 11, 12 Moreover, IFITM3 appears to be important for the intrinsic and inducible antiviral activity of human embryonic stem cells. 13 IFITMs have also been suggested to limit virus infection in a variety of other vertebrates, 1, 3 highlighting their possible evolutionarily-conserved function in host immunity."
,"In mainland China, most avian influenza A(H7N9) cases in the spring of 2013 were reported through the pneumonia of unknown etiology (PUE) surveillance system. To understand the role of possible underreporting and surveillance bias in assessing the epidemiology of subtype H7N9 cases and the effect of live-poultry market closures, we examined all PUE cases reported from 2004 through May 3, 2013. Historically, the PUE system was underused, reporting was inconsistent, and PUE reporting was biased toward A(H7N9)-affected provinces, with sparse data from unaffected provinces; however, we found no evidence that the older ages of persons with A(H7N9) resulted from surveillance bias. The absolute number and the proportion of PUE cases confirmed to be A(H7N9) declined after live-poultry market closures (p<0.001), indicating that market closures might have positively affected outbreak control. In China, PUE surveillance needs to be improved.","Prevention (China CDC) has conducted surveillance for pneumonia of unknown etiology (PUE) to facilitate timely detection of novel respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. On March 31, 2013, health authorities in China reported the first human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus to the World Health Organization (1) . In response to the emergence of A(H7N9), China CDC and provincial and local CDCs introduced testing for A(H7N9) virus of all persons with reported PUE. As of May 3, 2013, a total of 127 laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases, resulting in 24 deaths, had been reported from 10 provinces and municipalities in mainland China (hereafter referred to as affected areas). The median age of these case-patients was 62 years; most (71%) were males."
Interference of H-bonding and substituent effects in nitro-and hydroxy-substituted salicylaldehydes,"Two intramolecular interactions, i.e., (1) hydrogen bond and (2) substituent effect, were analyzed and compared. For this purpose, the geometry of 4-and 5-Xsubstituted salicylaldehyde derivatives (X=NO 2 , H or OH) was optimized by means of B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ methods. The results obtained allowed us to show that substituents (NO 2 or OH) in the para or meta position with respect to either OH or CHO in Hbonded systems interact more strongly than in the case of di-substituted species: 4-and 3-nitrophenol or 4-and 3hydroxybenzaldehyde by ∼31%. The substituent effect due to the intramolecular charge transfer from the para-counter substituent (NO 2 ) to the proton-donating group (OH) is ∼35% greater than for the interaction of para-OH with the proton-accepting group (CHO). The total energy of Hbonding for salicylaldehyde, and its derivatives, is composed of two contributions: ∼80% from the energy of H-bond formation and ∼20% from the energy associated with reorganization of the electron structure of the systems in question.","Salicylaldehyde is a compound with well-recognized significance in many branches of chemistry. It undergoes a variety of chemical reactions, very often being a key precursor for new compounds exhibiting diverse molecular structures and properties [1] [2] [3] . It is worth mentioning that the salicylaldehyde moiety appears in many compounds exhibiting various biological activity, including reactants used in the design of new inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase [4] , or compounds exhibiting antiviral activity [5] , as well as in reactions resulting in new compounds with anticancer [6, 7] or antimicrobial activity [8] . It is also present during the synthesis of new products called ""aspirin-like molecules"" exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity [9] . In addition to its presence in many chemical reactions, salicylaldehyde has also found applications in molecular engineering [10] ."
Occupational Deaths among Healthcare Workers,"Recent experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome and the US smallpox vaccination program have demonstrated the vulnerability of healthcare workers to occupationally acquired infectious diseases. However, despite acknowledgment of risk, the occupational death rate for healthcare workers is unknown. In contrast, the death rate for other professions with occupational risk, such as police officer or firefighter, has been well defined. With available information from federal sources and calculating the additional number of deaths from infection by using data on prevalence and natural history, we estimate the annual death rate for healthcare workers from occupational events, including infection, is 17-57 per 1 million workers. However, a much more accurate estimate of risk is needed. Such information could inform future interventions, as was seen with the introduction of safer needle products. This information would also heighten public awareness of this often minimized but essential aspect of patient care.","T he fundamental ethic of health care is that sick persons must receive care (1) . This premise carries an unstated consequence: an occupational risk to healthcare workers who respond to the needs of contagious patients. This predicament was shown yet again during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. As often occurs when infectious disease outbreaks are caused by an emerging agent, healthcare workers were the group most affected. According to the World Health Organization, 8,098 cases occurred during the outbreak, and 774 (9.6%) persons died (2) . Healthcare workers accounted for 1,707 (21%) of the cases (2) ."

465 ALI = acute lung injury; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; P a CO 2 = arterial partial pressure of CO 2 ; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pres- sure,"Mechanical ventilation is indispensable for the survival of patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, excessive tidal volumes and inadequate lung recruitment may contribute to mortality by causing ventilator-induced lung injury. This bench-to-bedside review presents the scientific rationale for using adjuncts to mechanical ventilation aimed at optimizing lung recruitment and preventing the deleterious consequences of reduced tidal volume. To enhance CO 2 elimination when tidal volume is reduced, the following are possible: first, ventilator respiratory frequency can be increased without necessarily generating intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure; second, instrumental dead space can be reduced by replacing the heat and moisture exchanger with a conventional humidifier; and third, expiratory washout can be used for replacing the CO 2 -laden gas present at end expiration in the instrumental dead space by a fresh gas (this method is still experimental). For optimizing lung recruitment and preventing lung derecruitment there are the following possibilities: first, recruitment manoeuvres may be performed in the most hypoxaemic patients before implementing the preset positive end-expiratory pressure or after episodes of accidental lung derecruitment; second, the patient can be turned to the prone position; third, closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning is to be preferred to open endotracheal suctioning.","Mechanical ventilation is indispensable for the survival of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, inappropriate ventilator settings may contribute to mortality by causing ventilatorinduced lung injury. Tidal volumes greater than 10 ml/kg have been shown to increase mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . High static intrathoracic pressures may overdistend and/or overinflate parts of the lung that remain well aerated at zero endinspiratory pressure [6] [7] [8] . Cyclic tidal recruitment and derecruitment experimentally produces bronchial damage and lung inflammation [9] . Although the clinical relevance of these experimental data has been challenged recently [10, 11] , the risk of mechanical ventilation-induced lung biotrauma supports the concept of optimizing lung recruitment during mechanical ventilation [12] . It has to be mentioned that the two principles aimed at reducing ventilator-induced lung injury may be associated with deleterious effects and require specific accompanying adjustments. Reducing the tidal volume below 10 ml/kg may increase the arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2 ) and impair tidal recruitment [13] . Optimizing lung recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may require a recruitment manoeuvre [14] and the prevention of endotracheal suctioning-induced lung derecruitment [15] . This bench-to-bedside review presents the scientific rationale supporting the clinical use of adjuncts to mechanical ventilation aimed at optimizing lung recruitment and preventing the deleterious consequences of reduced tidal volume."
Swabbing for respiratory viral infections in older patients: a comparison of rayon and nylon flocked swabs,"The purpose of this study was to compare the sampling efficacy of rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, and of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses in elderly patients. Samples were obtained from patients 60 years of age or above who were newly admitted to Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Using rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, comparable sets of mucosal samples were harvested from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. The samples were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. A total of 223 patients (mean age 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 9.0 years) were swabbed and a virus was recovered from 11% of the symptomatic patients. Regardless of the sampling site, a calculated 4.8 times higher viral load (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-17, p=0.017) was obtained using the nylon flocked swabs as compared to the rayon swabs. Also, regardless of the type of swab, a calculated 19 times higher viral load was found in the samples from the nasopharynx as compared to the oropharynx (95% CI 5.4-67.4, p<0.001). When swabbing for respiratory viruses in elderly patients, nasopharyngeal rather than oropharyngeal samples should be obtained. Nylon flocked swabs appear to be more efficient than rayon swabs.","In recent years, respiratory viruses have been established as significant causes of mortality and morbidity in the older population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, as respiratory pathogens may cause similar clinical pictures, the aetiological diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation [6] ."

Virus Morphology as an Aid for Rapid Diagnosis,"Standard methods of virus diagnosis may take many days to complete. As antiviral drugs are being used with more effectiveness, it becomes more important to develop rapid diagnostic methods. It takes only a few minutes to prepare and examine a specimen for electron microscopy (EM), using the negative staining technique. Viruses in the specimen can readily be identified by their morphology. In order to be detected by EM there must be at least 107 virus particles per milliliter of sample. This concentration is frequently found in certain types of specimens. The sensitivity of EM is increased 100-fold if homologous antibody is used to aggregate the virus. Visualization of virus-antibody aggregates forms the basis for serotyping by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM).","The commonly practised laboratory methods to detect the presence of a virus in clinical material have changed little in the past 25 years. A specimen is inoculated into a host system (tissue culture, eggs, animals), and subsequent detection and identification of an isolated virus depends on indicators such as cytopathic effect, hemagglutinin, complement fixation, etc. Results obtained by these procedures usually take several days-if not weeks-to complete. Thus, although they continue to serve as the backbone of most virus laboratories, current procedures are rarely capable of providing a rapid diagnosis."
Bioaerosol sampling for the detection of aerosolized influenza virus,"Background Influenza virus was used to characterize the efficacy of a cyclone-based, two-stage personal bioaerosol sampler for the collection and size fractionation of aerosolized viral particles.","Influenza infections are a public health concern accounting for more than 30 000 deaths and 100 000 hospitalizations annually. 1 The primary populations at risk for infection include young children, elderly adults, and immunocompromised subjects. During influenza outbreaks or pandemics, healthcare workers are at an elevated risk for acquiring influenza infection due to the prolonged periods of exposure to influenza viruses within healthcare settings. The mechanisms of influenza virus dissemination and transmission are poorly understood. Experimental studies have shown that influenza viruses can be transmitted via contact with respiratory secretions, large droplets, and aerosolized small particles ⁄ droplet nuclei. 2 Mucous membrane contact of large droplets expelled from the respiratory tract are thought to be the predominant mode by which influenza infection is transmitted, but small particle aerosols and droplet nuclei are also of concern due to the potential for prolonged airborne suspension. 3, 4 Given the epidemic potential and public health concern of newly emerging diseases such as avian influenza (H5N1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 5, 6 it is important to develop methods to study aerosolized viral particles. Such measures would not only enable improved monitoring and detection of viruses, but more importantly, would help prevent widespread transmission. To date, several bioaerosol samplers are available that use impaction or impinger sampling methodologies for viral aerosol detection. 7, 8 However, limitations exist within each of these methods such as poor collection efficiency, limited sampling time, and inability to separate particles based on size. Further complicating the study of viral aerosols is that in many environments where it would be desirable to sample for viral aerosols (e.g., hospitals, airports), the level of other biologically relevant particles such as bacteria, fungi, and pollens can also be very high."
X-ray Structural and Biological Evaluation of a Series of Potent and Highly Selective Inhibitors of Human Coronavirus Papain-like Proteases,"Structure-guided design was used to generate a series of noncovalent inhibitors with nanomolar potency against the papain-like protease (PLpro) from the SARS coronavirus (CoV). A number of inhibitors exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells and broadened specificity toward the homologous PLP2 enzyme from the human coronavirus NL63. Selectivity and cytotoxicity studies established a more than 100-fold preference for the coronaviral enzyme over homologous human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and no significant cytotoxicity in Vero E6 and HEK293 cell lines is observed. X-ray structural analyses of inhibitor-bound crystal structures revealed subtle differences between binding modes of the initial benzodioxolane lead (15g) and the most potent analogues 3k and 3j, featuring a monofluoro substitution at para and meta positions of the benzyl ring, respectively. Finally, the less lipophilic bis(amide) 3e and methoxypyridine 5c exhibit significantly improved metabolic stability and are viable candidates for advancing to in vivo studies.","More than 10 years after the pandemic caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (CoV), no anticoronaviral regimens have been developed for the treatment of SARS-CoV or any other human coronaviruses (HCoV) infection. SARS-CoV was established as the causative agent of the fatal global outbreak of respiratory disease in humans during 2002−2003 that resulted in a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 11%. 1 In October 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added SARS-CoV to the select agents list of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among many aspects that make SARS-CoV a potential threat to the human population, the lack of effective vaccines or anticoronaviral drugs had a significant impact in its classification as a select agent. However, even with the most extensive preventive measures, the reemergence of SARS-CoV or other virulent human coronaviruses poses a continuing threat. A powerful reminder of this, as well as of the fatal repercussions of the interspecies transmission potential of CoVs, was brought to the forefront in September 2012 by the emergence of a new SARSlike respiratory virus (previously termed HCoV-EMC, now designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV). 2, 3 As in the case of SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV is likely of zoonotic origin 4 and closely related to bat coronaviruses from the Betacoronavirus genus (group 2). 5 Reminiscent of the initial stages of SARS-CoV pandemic, global travel has contributed to the spread of MERS coronavirus, with a total of 178 laboratory-confirmed cases and a CFR of 43%. 6 The infected individuals display SARS-like symptoms, including a severe respiratory infection (SRI), and sometimes exhibit an acute renal failure which is a unique signature of MERS infection. 2b,7 Today, a total of 6 human coronaviruses are known, of which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are recognized as highly pathogenic with the potential for human-to-human transmission. 8 Without an efficacious antiviral agent or vaccine, the prevention of current and emerging coronaviruses continues to rely strongly on public health measures to contain outbreaks. Therefore, research toward the development of anticoronaviral drugs continues to be of paramount importance."
Clinical review: Update of avian influenza A infections in humans,"Influenza A viruses have a wide host range for infection, from wild waterfowl to poultry to humans. Recently, the cross-species transmission of avian influenza A, particularly subtype H5N1, has highlighted the importance of the non-human subtypes and their incidence in the human population has increased over the past decade. During cross-species transmission, human disease can range from the asymptomatic to mild conjunctivitis to fulminant pneumonia and death. With these cases, however, the risk for genetic change and development of a novel virus increases, heightening the need for public health and hospital measures. This review discusses the epidemiology, host range, human disease, outcome, treatment, and prevention of cross-transmission of avian influenza A into humans. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; HA = hemagglutinin; HPAI = highly pathogenic avian influenza; NA = neuroaminidase; WHO = World Health Organization.","Human influenza pandemics over the last 100 years have been caused by H1, H2, and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses. More recently, avian influenza virus subtypes (that is, H5, H7) have been found to directly infect humans from their avian hosts. The recent emergence, host expansion, and spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Asia have heightened concerns globally, both in regards to mortality from HPAI H5N1 infection in humans and the potential of a new pandemic. This paper will review the current human infections with avian influenza and their public health and medical implications."
Nucleocapsid Protein as Early Diagnostic Marker for SARS,"Serum samples from 317 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were tested for the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus, with sensitivities of 94% and 78% for the first 5 days and 6-10 days after onset, respectively. The specificity was 99.9%.

Twelve Essentials of Science-based Policy • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 7,"This article presents a systematic framework of 12 essentials, or basic elements, of science-based policy. The 12 essentials are grouped into three categories, or areas, as follows: 1) knowledge generation, which includes credible design, accurate data, sound analysis, and comprehensive synthesis; 2) knowledge exchange, which includes relevant content, appropriate translation, timely dissemination, and modulated release; and 3) knowledge uptake, which includes accessible information, readable message, motivated user, and rewarding outcome.","The relationship between science and policy is an important topic in evidence-based public health policy and practice (1) .

Definition of Mafa-A and -B haplotypes in pedigreed cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis),"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I B gene/allelic repertoire was investigated in a pedigreed population of cynomolgus macaques of mixed Indonesian/Malaysian origin. The Mafa-B alleles detected in this cohort are mostly specific for a given geographic area, and only a small number of alleles appears to be shared with other populations. This suggests the fast evolution of Mafa-B alleles due to adaptation to new environments. In contrast to humans, the B locus in Old World monkeys displays extensive copy number variation. The Mafa-B and previously defined -A gene combinations segregate in families and thus allowed the definition of extended haplotypes. In many cases it was possible to assign a particular Mafa-I allele to one of these Mafa-A/B haplotypes as well. The presence of a large number of stable haplotypes in this cohort of animals, which was pedigreed for up to eight generations, looks promising for developing discriminative MHC typing tools that are less cumbersome. Furthermore, the discovery of 53 unreported Mafa-B sequences expands the lexicon of alleles significantly, and may help in understanding the complex organisation of the macaque B region.","The cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), also known as the crab-eating or long-tailed macaque, is widely used as an animal model in biomedical studies. Currently this species is applied as often as the commonly used rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Cynomolgus monkeys are used as models for infectious diseases, such as AIDS, SARS and tuberculosis, as well as for transplantation research (McAuliffe et al. 2004; Wiseman et al. 2007; Aoyama et al. 2009; Mee et al. 2009; Reed et al. 2009 ). Owing to use of macaques in immune-related research, thorough investigations of their major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) are required. The MHC represents a multigene family in which the proteins play a key role in the generation of adaptive immune responses in vertebrate species. The class I and II genes of the MHC display abundant polymorphism that has a profound impact on features such as disease susceptibility, organ transplantation, and reproduction success."
Media Effects on Students during SARS Outbreak,"A few months after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, a sample of Canadian undergraduate university students completed a questionnaire that showed that, despite believing media coverage of the outbreak was excessive, they had little anxiety about acquiring SARS. Additionally, 69% of participants failed a SARS-specific knowledge section of the questionnaire.","T he 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) underlined the importance of fast and accurate risk communication to the public. Several studies have attempted to evaluate the media's performance during the outbreak (1, 2) , and the general consensus is that the media coverage was excessive, sometimes inaccurate, and sensationalist (1) (2) (3) . Whether this excessive coverage had a beneficial or detrimental effect on the public remains unknown. A logical assumption would be that, in response, the public would not only have high anxiety of acquiring SARS, but also would be more informed about the cause, symptoms, and other aspects associated with the syndrome. The purpose of this study was to determine, in an undergraduate university student population, preferences and use of various types of mass communication media, anxiety levels of acquiring the infection, and general knowledge of SARS."
"Variation in DNA-Damage Responses to an Inhalational Carcinogen (1,3-Butadiene) in Relation to Strain-Specific Differences in Chromatin Accessibility and Gene Transcription Profiles in C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ Mice","BACKGROUND: The damaging effects of exposure to environmental toxicants differentially affect genetically distinct individuals, but the mechanisms contributing to these differences are poorly understood. Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a ""compensation"" for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.","Inter-individual genetic variation can have profound impacts on the metabolism of pharmaceutical drugs and environmental toxicants (Ma and Lu 2011; Pierce et al. 2012 ). The molecular consequences of chemical exposure can therefore also vary across individuals and populations and may be attributable to variation in the expression of key metabolic genes, in the immune response, and in the DNA damage response pathway. Emerging evidence also suggests that chemical-induced effects may be transmitted transgenerationally through epigenetic means (Nadeau 2009 ). Yet, the underlying mechanisms for how genetics, metabolism, gene expression, and gene regulation combinatorially dictate the response to chemical exposure both within and across individuals is poorly understood."
Methodology Report Vaxign: The First Web-Based Vaccine Design Program for Reverse Vaccinology and Applications for Vaccine Development,"Vaxign is the first web-based vaccine design system that predicts vaccine targets based on genome sequences using the strategy of reverse vaccinology. Predicted features in the Vaxign pipeline include protein subcellular location, transmembrane helices, adhesin probability, conservation to human and/or mouse proteins, sequence exclusion from genome(s) of nonpathogenic strain(s), and epitope binding to MHC class I and class II. The precomputed Vaxign database contains prediction of vaccine targets for > 70 genomes. Vaxign also performs dynamic vaccine target prediction based on input sequences. To demonstrate the utility of this program, the vaccine candidates against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) were predicted using Vaxign and compared with various experimental studies. Our results indicate that Vaxign is an accurate and efficient vaccine design program.","Reverse vaccinology is an emerging vaccine development approach that starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by bioinformatics analysis of microbial genome sequences [1] . Predicted proteins are selected based on desirable attributes. Normal wet laboratory experiments are conducted in a later stage to test all or selected vaccine targets. Rino Rappuoli, the pioneer of reverse vaccinology [1, 2] , first applied this approach to the development of a vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB), the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults [2] . In this study, bioinformatic methods were first used to screen the complete genome of a MenB strain MC58 for genes encoding putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins. These proteins were predicted to be antigenic and therefore may represent the most suitable vaccine candidates. In total, 350 novel vaccine candidates were predicted and expressed in Escherichia coli; 28 were found to elicit protective immunity. It took less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered during the past 40 years by conventional methods [2] . Since then, the concept of reverse vaccinology has also successfully been applied to other pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis [3] , Porphyromonas gingivalis [4] , Chlamydia pneumoniae [5] , Streptococcus pneumoniae [6] , Helicobacter pylori [7] , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8] . Compared to a conventional vaccine development approach that starts from the wet laboratory, reverse vaccinology begins with bioinformatics analysis, which dramatically quickens the process of vaccine development."
Advance Access Publication,"The anticancer potential of catechins derived from green tea is not well understood, in part because catechin-related growth suppression and/or apoptosis appears to vary with the type and stage of malignancy as well as with the type of catechin. This in vitro study examined the biological effects of epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), EC 3-gallate (ECG) and EGC 3-gallate (EGCG) in cell lines from human gender-specific cancers. Cell lines developed from organ-confined (HH870) and metastatic (DU145) prostate cancer, and from moderately (HH450) and poorly differentiated (HH639) epithelial ovarian cancer were grown with or without EC, EGC, ECG or EGCG. When untreated cells reached confluency, viability and doubling time were measured for treated and untreated cells. Whereas EC treatment reduced proliferation of HH639 cells by 50%, EGCG suppressed proliferation of all cell lines by 50%. ECG was even more potent: it inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations of 24, 27, 29 and 30 mM, whereas EGCG inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations 89, 45, 62 and 42 mM. When compared with EGCG, ECG more effectively suppresses the growth of prostate cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines derived from tumors of patients with different stages of disease.","There is accruing evidence that green tea may have anticancer activity (1) , but the mechanisms for this action are poorly understood. Green tea is produced from the shrub Camellia sinensis (Fig. 1) ; leaves are dried but not fermented so that the green coloration attributed to polyphenols is retained. Commercially prepared green tea extracts contain $60% polyphenols (1) . These polyphenols are the source of bioflavonoids, which have strong antioxidant activity."
A Mechanism of Virus-Induced Demyelination,"Myelin forms an insulating sheath surrounding axons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is essential for rapid propagation of neuronal action potentials. Demyelination is an acquired disorder in which normally formed myelin degenerates, exposing axons to the extracellular environment. The result is dysfunction of normal neuron-to-neuron communication and in many cases, varying degrees of axonal degeneration. Numerous central nervous system demyelinating disorders exist, including multiple sclerosis. Although demyelination is the major manifestation of most of the demyelinating diseases, recent studies have clearly documented concomitant axonal loss to varying degrees resulting in long-term disability. Axonal injury may occur secondary to myelin damage (outside-in model) or myelin damage may occur secondary to axonal injury (inside-out model). Viral induced demyelination models, has provided unique imminent into the cellular mechanisms of myelin destruction. They illustrate mechanisms of viral persistence, including latent infections, virus reactivation and viral-induced tissue damage. These studies have also provided excellent paradigms to study the interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). In this review we will discuss potential cellular and molecular mechanism of central nervous system axonal loss and demyelination in a viral induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis.","Demyelination is the process by which axons lose their normal insulating myelin. Several central nervous system demyelinating disorders have been described in humans including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and osmotic demyelination (central pontine myelinolysis, extrapontine myelinolysis)."
The Plant Pathology Journal Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Potato virus X by Reverse Tran- scription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"The primary step for efficient control of viral diseases is the development of simple, rapid, and sensitive virus detection. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been used to detect viral RNA molecules because of its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses. RT-LAMP for the detection of Potato virus X (PVX) was developed and compared with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were conducted with or without a set of loop primers since one out of six primers showed PVX specificity. Based on real-time monitoring, RT-LAMP detected PVX around 30 min, compared to 120 min for RT-PCR. By adding a fluorescent reagent during the reaction, the extra step of visualization by gel electrophoresis was not necessary. RT-LAMP was conducted using simple inexpensive instruments and a regular incubator to evaluate whether RNA could be amplified at a constant temperature instead of using an expensive thermal cycler. This study shows the potential of RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of viral diseases and PVX epidemiology because of its simplicity and rapidness compared to RT-PCR.","LAMP will be useful not only for the detection of infected plants but also quarantine. The reactions are easily monitored by detecting the turbidity caused by the production of a large amount of target DNA (Webster et al., 2004) . The reaction time for RT-LAMP is less than 60 min and this time can be further reduced by adding two more loop primers (Ju, 2011; Nagamine et al., 2002) . In addition, if a fluorescent dye like SYBR Green is present in the reaction, PCR products in the reaction tubes can be seen with the naked eye under a UV lamp (Cardoso et al., 2010) ."
Optimizing antibiotic selection in treating COPD exacerbations,"Our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis and consequences of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increased substantially in the last decade. Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances refl ects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate signifi cant clinical benefi ts of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though improved outcomes in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratifi cation has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the 6th leading cause worldwide. It is estimated that by 2020, it would become the 3rd leading cause of death in the US and worldwide. Affecting 24 million people in the US, up to half of them undiagnosed, it accounts for 13.76 million offi ce visits, 1.5 million emergency room visits and 726,000 hospitalizations annually, at an estimated direct cost of $18 billion (NHLBI 2003) ."
Causation and Disease: Effect of Technology on Postulates of Causation*,"This paper reviews the technical developments in microbiology that led to the discovery of new infectious agents and the effect of these discoveries on establishing proof of causation. In bacteriology, these advances included the light microscope, bacterial stains, bacterial cultures, and the methods used to isolate clones. In virology, they involved the use of filters to separate viruses from bacteria, the electron microscope, the use of laboratory animals, embryonated eggs, tissue cultures to identify or grow the agent, and the recent development of molecular techniques to detect the presence of antigen in tissues. In immunology, they were based on the discovery of antibodies and of the immune response.","Our knowledge of the causation of infectious diseases depends on two major aspects: the conceptual and the technical. The former is concerned with our knowledge of the natural history of disease and its pathogenesis; the latter is concerned with the laboratory techniques available at the time to identify the organism, visualize it, grow it in the laboratory, reproduce the disease in an experimental animal, and explain how the organism causes the disease.

"Drug Design, Development and Therapy Find novel dual-agonist drugs for treating type 2 diabetes by means of cheminformatics","The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the world as well as the increasing reports about the adverse side effects of the existing diabetes treatment drugs have made developing new and effective drugs against the disease a very high priority. In this study, we report ten novel compounds found by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) using virtual screening and core hopping approaches. PPARs have drawn increasing attention for developing novel drugs to treat diabetes due to their unique functions in regulating glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism. The reported compounds are featured with dual functions, and hence belong to the category of dual agonists. Compared with the single PPAR agonists, the dual PPAR agonists, formed by combining the lipid benefit of PPARα agonists (such as fibrates) and the glycemic advantages of the PPARγ agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), are much more powerful in treating diabetes because they can enhance metabolic effects while minimizing the side effects. This was observed in the studies on molecular dynamics simulations, as well as on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, that these novel dual agonists not only possessed the same function as ragaglitazar (an investigational drug developed by Novo Nordisk for treating type 2 diabetes) did in activating PPARα and PPARγ, but they also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors. Moreover, the residues involved in forming the binding pockets of PPARα and PPARγ among the top ten compounds are explicitly presented, and this will be very useful for the in-depth conduction of mutagenesis experiments. It is anticipated that the ten compounds may become potential drug candidates, or at the very least, the findings reported here may stimulate new strategies or provide useful insights for designing new and more powerful dual-agonist drugs for treating type 2 diabetes.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common type of diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by insulin resistance and combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion. 1 It is a chronic metabolic disease that affects the body's ability to turn food into energy. People developing T2DM may suffer from blindness, renal failure, coronary artery disease, and so forth. 2 Because of its dramatic increase worldwide, T2DM has reached an epidemic scale that is anticipated to affect over 360 million people by 2030. 3, 4 Belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor family, peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs) are the ligand-activated transcription factors. 5, 6 PPARs, particularly the subtypes PPARα and PPARγ, played a central role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the control of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory processes. Accordingly, activating these receptors has become a promising therapeutic strategy for designing drugs against T2DM. 7 The activated PPARα receptors have a benef icial effect on lipid metabolism by regulating genes on fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. 8 PPARα agonists belong to the class of lipid-lowering drugs (such as fenofibrate and gemfibrozil), and are widely prescribed to reduce triglycerides. 9 The PPARγ receptors, the most widely studied subtype of PPARs, are located in adipocytes, muscles, and macrophages, where they have a direct influence on T2DM, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. 10, 11 Thiazolidinediones are a class of PPARγ agonists used in clinical practice to reduce plasma glucose level in type 2 diabetic patients, or to regulate glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal. 12 Unfortunately, if the drug were used alone, the undesirable side effects such as weight gain, edema, and anemia would be caused; 13 therefore, it is an urgent and challenging task to develop new dual agonists. In this regard, the novel PPARα/ PPARγ dual agonist, formed by combining the lipid benefit of PPARα agonists (such as fibrates) with the glycemic advantages of the PPARγ agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), has drawn considerable attention. 14 In developing the dual agonists, a critical problem surrounds how to identify the selectivity ratio of the receptor subtype, 15 because it may provide useful insights for finding the new drug candidates. There is more information available about designing potential dual treatments for treating T2DM. 16 Many studies have indicated that computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics, 17 molecular docking, 18 pharmacophore modeling, 19 Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) techniques, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] and a series of user-friendly web server predictors developed recently, such as G-protein-coupled receptors-grey incident degree analysis (GPCR-GIA) and G-protein-coupled receptors -2-layer predictor (GPCR-2L) for identifying G protein-coupled receptors and their types, 25, 26 iLoc-Euk and iLoc-Hum for predicting subcellular localization of eukaryotic and human proteins, 27,28 NR-2L for identifying nuclear receptors and their subfamilies, 29 ProtIdent for identifying proteases and their types, 30 and HIVcleave for predicting human immunodeficiency virus protease cleavage sites in proteins, 31, 32 can provide timely and very useful information, as well as insights for drug development. In addition to the aforementioned approaches, the Virtual Screening technique and Core Hopping technique are also very useful. [33] [34] [35] [36] The former can be used to screen for novel molecular scaffolds, 37, 38 while the latter can be used to generate new lead compounds with improved core properties. 37, 38 Encouraged by the aforementioned successful studies, the present study was initiated in an attempt to screen the fragment database in hopes to find a new antidiabetic compound. Meanwhile, the techniques of the core hopping associated with the glide docking and molecular dynamic simulation were utilized to analyze the binding interactions between the agonist and PPARs. 39, 40 The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) predictions were also used to evaluate whether the new agonist found to date possesses great potential to become a promising drug candidate for treating diabetes mellitus. 41, 42 "
Rapid Field Immunoassay for Detecting Antibody to Sin Nombre Virus in Deer Mice,We developed a 1-hour fi eld enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting antibody to Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus).

Four patients had tenosynovitis and pain at wrist pressure, and 1 had life-threatening manifestations. Four CHIKV strains were isolated, including 1 from the patient with the autochthonous case. The complete genomic sequence identified a new CHIKV variant emerging from the East/ central African evolutionary lineage.

However, recent events suggest that this situation may be changing (2) .

Historically, emerging diseases occur abruptly in outbreaks of unknown cause. Although various efforts have been proposed and conducted to analyze secondary data periodically (6) (7) (8) (9) , they generally provide information for the less urgent decision making in health policy and may not be in time for infectious disease control. Thus, a task force is needed to provide timely and accurate diagnosis for early control of any potential epidemic infection, especially in a newly developed country like Taiwan, where the healthcare resources may not be evenly distributed and autopsy for diagnosis is not widely accepted culturally."
,"Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic; wildlife constitutes a large and often unknown reservoir. Wildlife can also be a source for reemergence of previously controlled zoonoses. Although the discovery of such zoonoses is often related to better diagnostic tools, the leading causes of their emergence are human behavior and modifi cations to natural habitats (expansion of human populations and their encroachment on wildlife habitat), changes in agricultural practices, and globalization of trade. However, other factors include wildlife trade and translocation, live animal and bushmeat markets, consumption of exotic foods, development of ecotourism, access to petting zoos, and ownership of exotic pets. To reduce risk for emerging zoonoses, the public should be educated about the risks associated with wildlife, bushmeat, and exotic pet trades; and proper surveillance systems should be implemented.","Deforestation, development of human habitat, and mining activities have been suggested as risk factors associated with the reemergence of vampire bat rabies in humans in the Amazon Basin. In 2004, 46 persons died of rabies transmitted by vampire bats, mainly in Brazil (22 cases) and Colombia (14 cases) ; only 20 human cases of rabies were transmitted by dogs in all Latin America (9) . A similar trend was again observed for 2005."
Disease Associated with Equine Coronavirus Infection and High Case Fatality Rate,Background: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is associated with clinical disease in adult horses. Outbreaks are associated with a low case fatality rate and a small number of animals with signs of encephalopathic disease are described.,"E quine coronavirus (ECoV) infection was initially reported in neonatal foals (≤2 weeks of age) with and without clinical signs suggestive of enteritis. 1, 2 Outbreaks of ECoV are described in adult horses at racing facilities and boarding stables. [3] [4] [5] Descriptions of outbreaks of ECoV infection involving breeding farms and young horses (<1 year of age) are not reported."
Thampi and Morris Critical Care,Infection prevention and control interventions are costeff ective and improve patient outcomes in critically ill patients in the ICU.,"In the last 50 years, the discipline of infection prevention and control (IPAC) has undergone numerous metamorphoses. Initially intended to address nosocomial infections at the time of a nationwide epidemic of hospital-based staphylococcal infections [1] , the practice of IPAC has shifted from that of reaction to prevention. Th ere has been increasing emphasis on prevention of nosocomial infections through principles of hand hygiene, cleaning and sterilization, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. Nonetheless, infectious diseases continue to challenge the quality of care provided in ICUs. Prompted by accreditation and patient-centered care, hospitals are challenged to provide high-quality care with fi nite fi nancial resources. Any new IPAC initiative will thus be examined for its cost-eff ectiveness."
Remaining Questions about Clinical Variola Major,"After the recent summary of World Health Organizationauthorized research on smallpox, several clinical issues remain. This policy review addresses whether early hemorrhagic smallpox is disseminated intravascular coagulation and speculates about the cause of the high mortality rate among pregnant women and whether ocular smallpox is partly the result of trachoma or vitamin A deficiency. The joint destruction common in children with smallpox might be prevented by antiviral drugs, but intraarticular infusion of antiviral drugs is unprecedented. Development of highly effective antiviral drugs against smallpox raises the issue of whether postexposure vaccination can be performed without interference by an antiviral drug. Clinicians should consider whether patients with smallpox should be admitted to general hospitals. Although an adequate supply of secondgeneration smallpox vaccine exists in the United States, its use is unclear. Finally, political and ethical forces suggest that destruction of the remaining stocks of live smallpox virus is now appropriate.","A fter the World Health Organization (WHO) declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, several problems remained concerning the disease and its causative virus, variola major virus. These problems included high rates of adverse events associated with most strains of vaccinia virus; our inadequate understanding of the pathophysiology of smallpox; lack of a good animal model of the disease; diffi culty of rapid laboratory diagnosis, including the poor ability of most standard laboratory tests to distinguish between orthopoxviruses; lack of an effective antiviral drug; and rudimentary knowledge about the genetic makeup of the virus. Although many observers wished to destroy the remaining stocks of variola major virus in 1980, several respected researchers wanted to use the live virus to help answer some of these remaining questions. In 1999, WHO agreed to a research agenda, with oversight by a WHO committee, to continue research with live variola major virus until substantial progress was made on these questions. The WHO oversight committee has now declared that satisfactory (if in some areas imperfect) progress has been made toward developing improved vaccines, better laboratory diagnostics, a reasonable nonhuman primate animal model, effective antiviral drugs, and good understanding of the genetics of orthopoxviruses. Reports of this progress have been published (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) ."
"Analysis of trends in emergency department attendances, hospital admissions and medical staffing in a Hong Kong university hospital: 5-year study","Background The workload of emergency departments (ED) continually changes in response to presentations, overcrowding and availability of expertise and investigations. Aims To investigate changes in ED presentations and care processes, and the relationship of patient demand and ED staff resources to waiting times and processing times. Methods Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected administrative data from January 1999 to April 2005 in an emergency department in a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. All patients attending the emergency department during the study period were included. Monthly attendance data were retrieved and analysed to determine both qualitative and quantitative changes in the patterns of presentation to the ED using prospectively gathered data. Results Total ED attendances decreased by 25% during the study with little seasonal variation. The admission rate and the use of ambulances increased steadily and significantly. Medical patients are increasing proportionately, but trauma patients are decreased in number. Conclusion There have been major changes in the patterns of ED attendances and ED waiting times over the study period in this teaching hospital ED. Decreasing overall ED numbers are offset by an increasingly elderly population and a more complex case mix. Reducing clinical staff numbers appears to reduce the ED's capacity to provide timely assessments and care and to function as hospital gatekeepers. Restoring staff numbers to previous levels may improve the quality and timeliness of ED services. It is necessary to refine measures of ED complexity and workload to determine appropriate staffing levels in the future.","Over the last 50 years, demands on emergency departments (EDs) have dramatically changed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In the early years of emergency care, EDs received a limited number of patients, most of whom had experienced some form of injury. With demographic changes in society, increasing life expectancy and greater personal and clinical expectations, EDs now deal with a greater proportion of patients with medical illnesses rather than traumatic injury, and attendance rates have soared [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ."
"Quarantine for SARS, Taiwan","During the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan, >150,000 persons were quarantined, 24 of whom were later found to have laboratoryconfirmed SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Since no evidence exists that SARS-CoV is infective before the onset of symptoms and the quarantined persons were exposed but not symptomatic, we thought the quarantine's effectiveness should be investigated. Using the Taiwan quarantine data, we found that the onset-to-diagnosis time of previously quarantined confirmed case-patients was significantly shortened compared to that for those who had not been quarantined. Thus, quarantine for SARS in Taiwan screened potentially infective persons for swift diagnosis and hospitalization after onset, thereby indirectly reducing infections. Full-scale quarantine measures implemented on April 28 led to a significant improvement in onset-to-diagnosis time of all SARS patients, regardless of previous quarantine status. We discuss the temporal effects of quarantine measures and other interventions on detection and isolation as well as the potential usefulness of quarantine in faster identification of persons with SARS and in improving isolation measures.","T he severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic from November 2002 to June 2003 came with much public attention and left swiftly, resulting in >8,000 probable cases worldwide and 774 deaths (1) . Prominent among retrospective analyses is the belief that the simple ancient system of placing persons suspected of being infected under quarantine was instrumental in the quick containment of the outbreak (2) (3) (4) (5) . However, questions persist regarding how quarantine worked to control this disease, given the time-tested axiom that quarantine is most useful only when patients are infectious before becoming symptomatic, thus directly preventing secondary infections (6) . Moreover, due to early confusion resulting from imprecise clinical diagnosis and case definition (7) , correct clinical diagnosis and prompt isolation were often impossible, which resulted in insufficient isolation and gaps in the containment strategy for hospital infection control (8) . Since all available evidence indicates that SARS patients were only infectious after symptom onset (9) , one may argue that quarantine provides a window of several days during which illnesses can be diagnosed swiftly and persons isolated accordingly. In this study, we used data from the Taiwan SARS outbreak to explore whether quarantine was effective in expediting the time from onset to clinical diagnosis and hospitalization, and the time from clinical diagnosis to classification as a probable case-patient, thus contributing indirectly to prevention of possible infections."
Resistance of livestock to viruses: mechanisms and strategies for genetic engineering,"This communication aims to inform readers from research and industry about the possibilities of developing genetic engineering strategies for improvement of resistance to viruses in livestock. It briefly reviews coevolution of hosts and parasites, principal elements of virus-host interactions, existing resistance mechanisms, and conventional methods for improvement of disease resistance. Research results from genetic engineering of new resistance mechanisms in both plants and animals, as well as investigation of possible risks and 'biological cost' of such mechanisms are summarized as a background for the discussion of prerequisites and strategies for future genetic engineering of resistance to viruses in livestock. It is concluded that, while conventional breeding methods will remain the principal approach to the improvement of disease resistance, in some instances the introduction of new, genetically engineered resistance mechanisms may be justified. livestock / virus / resistance mechanism / genetic engineering Résumé -Résistance des animaux de ferme aux virus: mécanismes et stratégies de génie génétique.

Many of the current livestock disease problems that prevent the realization of this optimal production goal are caused by viruses, described by Peter Medawar as &dquo;pieces of bad news wrapped in protein coat&dquo;. This review deals with possible new, genetic engineering strategies for the improvement of resistance to viruses in livestock. Since work on genetic engineering of disease resistance is more advanced in plants than in livestock, information on research in plants is also reviewed."
Targeting and retention of HPV16 E7 to the endoplasmic reticulum enhances immune tumour protection Short Communication,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are loaded with epitopes to cause an immune cellular response. Most of the protein antigens are degraded in the cytoplasm to amino acids and few epitopes reach the ER. Antigen targeting of this organelle by Calreticulin (CRT) fusion avoids this degradation and enhances the immune response. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to express the E7 antigen with an ER-targeting signal peptide (SP) plus an ER retention signal (KDEL sequence). In cell-culture experiments we demonstrated that this new E7 antigen, SP-E7-KDEL, targeted the ER. Infection of mice with this recombinant adenovirus that expresses SP-E7-KDEL showed interferon induction and tumour-protection response, similar to that provided by an adenovirus expressing the E7 antigen fused to CRT. This work demonstrated that just by adding a SP and the KDEL sequence, antigens can be targeted and retained in the ER with a consequent enhancement of immune response and tumour protection. These results will have significant clinical applications. Mice. Female C57BL6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan (México City, México), housed in the animal facilities of the Histology Department of the School of Medicine, UANL, and cared for in conformity with good laboratory practice guidelines. Cell lines. HEK293 cells were maintained in advanced DMEM supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS). TC-1 cells derived from primary epithelial cells of C57BL/6 mice co-transformed with HPV-16 E6 and E7 and the c-Ha-ras oncogenes, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All of the cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).","The CD8 ϩ T cells are key players in the immune response to intracellular infections and tumours. Recognition of any intracellular or viral protein by CD8 ϩ cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires an initial cytosolic proteolytic processing by proteasomes to peptide products, which are then translocated by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they assemble with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to be presented to the cell surface [1] . Most peptides released from the proteasome into the cytosol are promptly degraded by cytosolic endopetidases and aminopep-tidases to single amino acids before they can 'escape' by binding to the TAP and enter the ER. It has been calculated that only one peptide binds to an MHC class I molecule from 10 4 degraded proteins [2] . This explains the relatively subtle efficiency of antigen presentation by class I molecules. Coupled with this, cervical cancer cells (as well as a number of other malignant tumours) often show down regulation or, in a subset of cases, complete loss of MHC class I expression, most likely as a mechanism of immune escape [3] ."
Jasmonic Acid (JA) Acts as a Signal Molecule in LaCl 3 -Induced Baicalin Synthesis in Scutellaria baicalensis Seedlings,"Rare earth elements (REEs) have been widely used to increase accumulation of biomass and secondary metabolites in medicinal plants in China. However, very few studies have investigated how REEs mediate secondary metabolism synthesis in medicinal plants. Lanthanum (La), an important REE, is known to improve the accumulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants and is widely distributed in China. However, few studies have evaluated the signal transduction leading to La-induced secondary metabolism in medicinal plants. In this study, LaCl 3 treatmentinduced multiple responses in Scutellaria baicalensis seedlings, including the rapid generation of jasmonic acid (JA), sequentially followed by the enhancement of baicalin production. Direct application of JA also promoted the synthesis of baicalin in the absence of LaCl 3 . LaCl 3 -induced baicalin synthesis was blocked by two different JA synthesis inhibitors. Our results showed that JA acts as a signal component within the signaling system leading to La-induced baicalin synthesis in S. baicalensis seedlings.","Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in maintaining people's health [1] . During the last two decades, the use of herbal medicines has expanded globally and gained considerable attention because of their low toxicity and good therapeutic performance [2] . Scutellaria baicalensis (referred to in TCM as ""huang qin"") is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in TCM. Baicalin is the most abundant active component in huang qin and is an important secondary metabolite in S. baicalensis induced by exogenous stress. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, anti-tumor and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus effects [3] . The everincreasing demand for huang qin has stimulated the improvement of cultivated practices of S. baicalensis."
Antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes as a genetically programmable synthetic vaccine,"Liposomes are versatile (sub)micron-sized membrane vesicles that can be used for a variety of applications, including drug delivery and in vivo imaging but they also represent excellent models for artificial membranes or cells. Several studies have demonstrated that in vitro transcription and translation can take place inside liposomes to obtain compartmentalized production of functional proteins within the liposomes (Kita et al. in Chembiochem 9(15):. Such a minimal artificial cell-based model is ideal for synthetic biology based applications. In this study, we propose the use of liposomes as artificial microbes for vaccination. These artificial microbes can be genetically programmed to produce specific antigens at will. To show proof-of-concept for this artificial cell-based platform, a bacterial in vitro transcription and translation system together with a gene construct encoding the model antigen b-galactosidase were entrapped inside multilamellar liposomes. Vaccination studies in mice showed that such antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes (AnExILs) elicited higher specific humoral immune responses against the produced antigen (b-galactosidase) than control vaccines (i.e. AnExILs without genetic input, liposomal b-galactosidase or pDNA encoding b-galactosidase).","Synthetic biology is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary research field that aims to construct new biological parts and systems with new functionalities through a process of engineering and standardization. Vaccines may also benefit from a synthetic biology-based design. With vaccination the aim is to delude the immune system with an antigenic formulation to make it believe it is dealing with a natural infection, however, without causing illness. At present, the majority of vaccines on the market consist of attenuated or inactivated pathogens. Although effective, these systems are poorly defined, suffer from batch-to-batch variation and can only be used for pathogens that can be readily cultivated in the lab at scales that permit vaccine production. Moreover, as the ratio of antigenic compounds within the pathogen is more-or-less fixed, there is poor control over the direction against which antigenic compound an immune reaction will be evoked. The bottom-up design of vaccines which consist of well-defined antigenic compounds (e.g. proteins or nucleic acids) offers better control over the evoked immune reaction, however, the design of such vaccines is often empirical and in general yields vaccines that are poorly immunogenic and rely on adjuvants in order to be effective. Moreover, most vaccine production schemes are rather time-consuming, and therefore not suitable for rapid response intervention, for example, to prevent the pandemic spread of a new influenza strain in the human population."
Natural killer cells act as rheostats modulating anti-viral T cells HHS Public Access,"Anti-viral T cells are thought to regulate whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infections result in viral control, asymptomatic persistence, or severe disease, though the reasons for these different outcomes remain unclear. Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK) cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection 1-3 , implying that NK cells are playing a role in these T cell-associated diseases. While direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to anti-viral defense during some virus infections, especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans 4-5 , NK cells have also been suspected as having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T cell responses by lysing MCMVinfected antigen-presenting cells 6-7 . In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems resistant to any direct anti-viral effects of NK cells 5, 8 . Here the roles of NK cells in regulating T cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology were examined in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus dose NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at a medium dose NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T cell-mediated support for the anti-viral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.","at day 15 p.i. (Fig. 1b) . The high dose caused a precipitous drop in body weight during the first week of infection (Fig. 1a, right) , but, thereafter, clonal exhaustion and deletion of LCMV-specific T cells resulted in a persistent infection 9-10 associated with minimal lung pathology (Fig. 1b, Right) and 100% (77 of 77) survival (Fig. 1c, Top) . Selective depletion of NK cells using 25 µg of anti-NK1.1 mAb (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) one day prior to high dose infection resulted in 58% (35 of 65) mortality between days 9 and 13 of infection (Fig.  1c , Top) associated with severe pulmonary edema (data not shown) and reduced viral titers by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1d, Right) . Under these high dose conditions, therefore, the presence of NK cells promoted persistence and prevented mortality."
Longitudinally Profiling Neutralizing Antibody Response to SARS Coronavirus with Pseudotypes,The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein (S) is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. Retroviral SARS-CoV S pseudotypes have been constructed and used to develop an in vitro microneutralization assay that is both sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization titers measured by this assay are highly correlated to those measured by an assay using replicationcompetent SARS-CoV. No cross-neutralization occurred with human sera known to contain antibodies to coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E. The pseudotype assay was used to profile neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV S in sequential serum samples taken from 41 confirmed SARS patients during the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong and shows long-lasting immunity in most recovered patients. The pseudotype assay does not require handling live SARS virus; it is a useful tool to determine neutralizing titers during natural infection and the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines.,"T he coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) is a new human pathogen for which a vaccine may be urgently required should a new outbreak occur. Studying the magnitude and longevity of the neutralizing antibody response during natural infection will help establish correlates of protection to be generated by immunization. Humoral immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA responses to SARS-CoV have been studied extensively (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, studies of neutralizing antibody responses during natural infection have been limited (8, 9) , partially because neutralization assays must be performed at biosafety level 3 or higher."
Detection of novel astroviruses in urban brown rats and previously known astroviruses in humans,"Several novel astroviruses have been recently discovered in humans and in other animals. Here, we report results from our surveillance of astroviruses in human and rodent faecal samples in Hong Kong. Classical human astroviruses (n59) and a human MLB1 astrovirus were detected in human faecal samples (n5622). Novel astroviruses were detected from 1.6 % of the faecal samples of urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) (n5441), indicating the prevalence of astrovirus infection in rats might be much lower than that recently observed in bats. These rat astroviruses were phylogenetically related to recently discovered human astroviruses MLB1 and MLB2, suggesting that the MLB viruses and these novel rat astroviruses may share a common ancestor.","The family Astroviridae comprises non-enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The members of the family are classified into mamastroviruses and avastroviruses and are known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively (Mendez & Arias, 2007) . In human, the classical human astroviruses are genetically closely related and can be classified into eight serotypes (HAstV1-8). In addition, several genetically distinct human astroviruses (e.g. MLB1) have been recently identified in stool samples from patients suffering from gastroenteritis (Finkbeiner et al., 2008a (Finkbeiner et al., , 2009a Kapoor et al., 2009) . Although astrovirus is one of the major causative agents for gastroenteritis, there is relatively little information on the ecology and evolution of these viruses. The recent discoveries of genetically diverse astroviruses in bats (Chu et al., 2008b; Zhu et al., 2009) and other animals (Atkins et al., 2009; Rivera et al., 2010) highlight the genetic diversity of astroviruses in nature and suggest that there might be many more novel astroviruses circulating in peridomestic and wild animals."
Therapeutic Efficacy of the Small Molecule GS-5734 against Ebola Virus in Rhesus Monkeys,"The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa -unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected -highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae 1 . No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we describe the discovery of a novel anti-EBOV small molecule antiviral, GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternate substrate and RNAchain terminator in primer-extension assays utilizing a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com","NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life = 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eye, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once daily intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two of six treated animals. These results provide the first substantive, post-exposure protection by a smallmolecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses -including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses -suggests the potential for expanded indications. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing."
LETTERS Acknowledgments We thank,for fi eld collections; J. Andre for research permits; T. Kreeger for access to his facility; R. Massung for positive-control DNA; and G. Dahlem for identifying Ravinia spp.,"To the Editor: In the November 2007 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Gayer et al. (1) describe how confl ict leaves populations in dire poverty, internally displaced or seeking asylum, having poor access to essential services, and consequentially vulnerable to infectious diseases. Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is a disease that seems particularly sensitive to confl ict and deserves more consideration. Major risk factors for cholera-poverty, overcrowding, poor hygiene, contaminated food, and lack of safe drinking water (2,3)-largely resemble the consequences of war and civil fi ghting. Yet little is known about the relationship between cholera and confl ict. This lack of information may be because cholera tends to be epidemic, affecting hundreds to thousands of people across vast, war-torn regions, making it impossible for local governments, nongovernment organizations, and aid workers to control, let alone collect and analyze data."
Population Responses during the Pandemic Phase of the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Epidemic,"During the pre-community outbreak phase of the H1N1 epidemic from May 6 to June 6 2009, two studies in Hong Kong reported a moderate level of perceived susceptibility of contracting the disease (around 7.5% to 12.1% of the general population felt susceptible) and perceived severity of H1N1 (over 15% of general population believed that H1N1 is highly fatal), plus a low level of H1N1-related distress in the community (less than 5% were panicking). Misconceptions about the modes of H1N1 transmissions were common. These studies found that perceptions related to bodily damages, efficacy of frequent handwashing, non-availability of effective vaccines, chance of having a large-scale local outbreak, and mental distress due to influenza A/H1N1 were associated with frequent handwashing (1,2). Another study involving a series of cross-sectional surveys was also conducted, suggesting a generally low level of anxiety and a slight improvement in knowledge on modes of transmission throughout the epidemic. The perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of getting H1N1 were high in the early phase, but started to decline in the early pandemic phase epidemic and remained stable thereafter. Preventive behaviors like handwashing and wearing facemasks did not show significant change throughout the epidemic, while avoidance behaviors like avoiding going to crowded places declined gradually at the pandemic unfolds (3). During the early phase of the global H1N1 pandemic, other international studies reported a moderate level of distress in the U.S., a lack of preventive responses such as change in frequency of handwashing in the UK (4) and in India, plus a lack of support for governmental mitigation strategies, such as school closure in Australia (5). Other studies found that Korean college students and Italian healthcare workers washed their hands or used hand sanitizer more frequently than before the beginning of the pandemic. The Chinese general population in seven urban regions and two rural regions showed an increasing level of knowledge, but a declining level of risk perception and adoption of preventive measures, while the U.S. general population showed an increasing trend in perceived risk but a decreasing trend in prevalence of precautionary activities (6). A study in Malaysia also showed that preventive measures, fear and avoidance changed in concordance with the trend in number of reported deaths (7).",The gender/age distributions were comparable to those of the recent census data (% female = 46.0%; % 40-60 = 51.5%).
Mesodynamics in the SARS nucleocapsid measured by NMR field cycling,"Protein motions on all timescales faster than molecular tumbling are encoded in the spectral density. The dissection of complex protein dynamics is typically performed using relaxation rates determined at high and ultrahigh field. Here we expand this range of the spectral density to low fields through field cycling using the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus as a model system. The field-cycling approach enables site-specific measurements of R 1 at low fields with the sensitivity and resolution of a high-field magnet. These data, together with high-field relaxation and heteronuclear NOE, provide evidence for correlated rigid-body motions of the entire b-hairpin, and corresponding motions of adjacent loops with a time constant of 0.8 ns (mesodynamics). MD simulations substantiate these findings and provide direct verification of the time scale and collective nature of these motions.","The dynamic nature of proteins is one of the key elements of their function. Although this principle is widely accepted, the detailed characterization of protein motions at atomic resolution is much more challenging than determining the average static structure. High field NMR is a particularly powerful method for studying protein dynamics at atomic resolution over a wide array of time scales and has therefore extensively been used in the last two decades. The major emphasis on the development of ultra-high-field magnets for an increase in sensitivity and resolution has allowed investigations on ever-larger biomolecular systems. Ironically, this high-field regime is not as sensitive to mesodynamics as relaxation data at lower fields. Low-field R 1 relaxation experiments covering 1 H Larmor frequencies up to several tens of MHz have been performed using fieldcycling relaxometers (Kimmich 1996; Luchinat and Parigi 2007) . Due to the low resolution, these experiments have usually probed the relaxation of solvent protons as reporters, and are therefore limited. Here we report R 1 relaxation data of a protein at low field, but with atomic resolution, using a field-cycling apparatus in a commercial 500 MHz magnet (Redfield 2003) . By physically moving the sample in the magnet bore the relaxation behavior can be investigated at various low fields; however, the return of the sample to its initial position allows these measurements with the resolution and sensitivity of the high field. This approach has been successfully applied to studies of lipids and DNA, using one-dimensional 31 P and 13 C spectra (Roberts et al. 2004; Sivanandam et al. 2009 ). Here we use two-dimensional 1 H 15 N heteronuclear experiments spanning from 17.3 to 91.2 MHz ( 15 N Larmor frequency will be used throughout, corresponding to 170-900 MHz ''spectrometers'') to investigate the dynamics of the N-terminal domain of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) nucleocapsid protein (SARSN)."
"Spillover of Swine Coronaviruses, United States","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a pathogen first detected in US domestic swine in 2013, has rapidly spilled over into feral swine populations. A better understanding of the factors associated with pathogen emergence is needed to better manage, and ultimately prevent, future spillover events from domestic to nondomestic animals.","P athogen spillover mechanisms vary, but one route involves pathogens moving from heavily infected domestic animal hosts to nondomestic hosts (1). These spillover and emergence events create a dynamic landscape for pathogen transmission."
Modeling Control Strategies of Respiratory Pathogens,"Effectively controlling infectious diseases requires quantitative comparisons of quarantine, infection control precautions, case identification and isolation, and immunization interventions. We used contact network epidemiology to predict the effect of various control policies for a mildly contagious disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and a moderately contagious disease, such as smallpox. The success of an intervention depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the contact pattern between persons within a community. The model predicts that use of face masks and general vaccination will only moderately affect the spread of mildly contagious diseases. In contrast, quarantine and ring vaccination can prevent the spread of a wide spectrum of diseases. Contact network epidemiology can provide valuable quantitative input to public health decisionmaking, even before a pathogen is well characterized.","P ublic concern regarding emerging infectious diseases is on the rise. The 21st century began with the emergence or reemergence of zoonotic diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1), avian influenza (2) , monkeypox infection (3), West Nile virus disease (4), mad cow disease (5) , anthrax due to bioterrorist attacks (6) , and unusual influenza epidemics (7) . In addition to these new threats, public health officials face a large number of disease outbreaks every year in hospitals, schools, and other small communities. While development of vaccines and diagnostic tools proceeds at an unprecedented pace, development of tools for determining optimal intervention strategies lags behind."
ANOTHER DIMENSION Emerging Infectious Literatures and the Zombie Condition,"The book club format has enabled expert and nonexpert exploration of infection and epidemiology as encountered in popular literature. This exploration reveals that fiction focusing on apocalyptic disease often uses the zombie as embodiment of infection, as well as an exemplar of current knowledge on emerging disease.",T he Bad Bugs Book Club (https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/ engage/what-we-do/bad-bugs-bookclub/) was established in 2009 (1) . This reading group meets every 2 months to discuss works of literary fiction from any genre that features infectious disease. The aim of these meetings is to engage scientists and nonscientists in discussions about epidemiology and infection and to consider what the texts tell us about our perception of science and its advances.
"The effects of Nigella sativa (Ns), Anthemis hyalina (Ah) and Citrus sinensis (Cs) extracts on the replication of coronavirus and the expression of TRP genes family","Extracts of Anthemis hyalina (Ah), Nigella sativa (Ns) and peels of Citrus sinensis (Cs) have been used as folk medicine to fight antimicrobial diseases. To evaluate the effect of extracts of Ah, Ns and Cs on the replication of coronavirus (CoV) and on the expression of TRP genes during coronavirus infection, HeLa-CEACAM1a (HeLa-epithelial carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a) cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 (mouse hepatitis virus-A59) at moi of 30. 1/50 dilution of the extracts was found to be the safe active dose. ELISA kits were used to detect the human IL-8 levels.","Coronaviruses (CoV), members of the Coronaviridae family, are enveloped viruses that contain non-segmented, positive-stranded genomic RNA [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Ultrastructural analysis of CoV have revealed that they form pleomorphic particles that are roughly spherical but show variations in size (80-120 nm in diameter) and shape [7] [8] [9] [10] . The entire CoV replication cycle take places in the cytoplasm. In general, enveloped viruses are able to use a variety of cellular membranes at different steps of their life cycles. In fact, almost any membranous subcellular compartment appears to be used by particular viruses to support their replication complex and assembly process [10, 11] ."
Engineered hepatitis B virus surface antigen L protein particles for in vivo active targeting of splenic dendritic cells,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of adaptive T-cell responses. By capturing exogenous antigens and presenting antigen-derived peptides via major histocompatibility complex molecules to naïve T cells, DCs induce antigen-specific immune responses in vivo. In order to induce effective host immune responses, active delivery of exogenous antigens to DCs is considered important for future vaccine development. We recently generated bionanocapsules (BNCs) consisting of hepatitis B virus surface antigens that mediate stringent in vivo cell targeting and efficient endosomal escape, and after the fusion with liposomes (LP) containing therapeutic materials, the BNC-LP complexes deliver them to human liver-derived tissues in vivo. BNCs were further modified to present the immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-interacting domain (Z domain) derived from Staphylococcus aureus protein A in tandem. When mixed with IgGs, modified BNCs (ZZ-BNCs) displayed the IgG Fv regions outwardly for efficient binding to antigens in an oriented-immobilization manner. Due to the affinity of the displayed IgGs, the IgG-ZZ-BNC complexes accumulated in specific cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo. After mixing ZZ-BNCs with antibodies against DCs, we used immunocytochemistry to examine which antibodies delivered ZZ-BNCs to mouse splenic DCs following intravenous injection of the ZZ-BNCs. ZZ-BNCs displaying anti-CD11c monoclonal antibodies (α-CD11c-ZZ-BNCs) were found to accumulate with approximately 62% of splenic DCs, and reside within some of them. After the fusion with liposomes containing antigens, the α-CD11c-ZZ-BNCs could elicit the respective antibodies more efficiently than other nontargeting control vaccines, suggesting that this DC-specific nanocarrier is promising for future vaccines.","coronavirus, 8 and lentivirus displaying the Sindbis virus glycoprotein 9 have been used for DC-specific gene delivery. However, these vectors present the potential problems commonly observed in viral vectors, including unexpected immunological responses in patients, accidental disturbance of the patients' chromosomes, and unacceptability for Ags other than DNA. Nonviral vectors have also been utilized for delivering Ags to DCs. Nanoparticles consisting of poly(γ-glutamic acid) could target DCs passively through systemic administration. 10 Micelles consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-based amphipathic polymer accumulated in nearly 20% of DCs in draining lymph nodes following intradermal injection. 11 Liposomes (LPs) and Ags, modified with Fv forms of α-CD11c, 12, 13 bacterial flagellin-related peptide, 14 and mannose, 15 could target DCs more efficiently than passive targeting due to their specific interactions with DC surface molecules. Although these nonviral vectors may in part solve the viral vector-related problems described above, they potentially lack the mechanisms for infection and endosomal escape (eg, membrane fusiogenic domain of viral envelope proteins), leading to reduced immunogenicity of Ags due to low recognition efficiency of DCs. Therefore, it is necessary to endow nonviral vectors with both targeting ability and membrane fusiogenic activity in order to develop effective DC-targeting nanocarriers for future vaccines."
,"We recommend several actions that could improve hospitals' abilities to deliver critical care during epidemics involving large numbers of victims. In the absence of careful pre-event planning, demand for critical care services may quickly exceed available intensive care unit (ICU) staff, beds and equipment, leaving the bulk of the infected populace without benefit of potentially lifesaving critical care. The toll of death may be inversely proportional to the ability to augment critical care capacity, so critical care health care professionals must take the lead for planning and preparing to care for numbers of seriously ill patients that far exceed available ICU beds.","We recommend several actions that could improve hospitals' and communities' abilities to deliver critical care during epidemics and bioterrorist attacks involving large numbers of victims with life-threatening illness. These recommendations are in part the result of deliberations by the multidisciplinary Working Group on Emergency Mass Medical Care, which comprises 33 professionals with expertise in critical care medicine, biosecurity, disaster preparedness, and infection control (Rubinson et al., unpublished data)."
"Distant Relatives of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Close Relatives of Human Coronavirus 229E in Bats, Ghana","We tested 12 bat species in Ghana for coronavirus (CoV) RNA. The virus prevalence in insectivorous bats (n = 123) was 9.76%. CoV was not detected in 212 fecal samples from Eidolon helvum fruit bats. Leaf-nosed bats pertaining to Hipposideros ruber by morphology had group 1 and group 2 CoVs. Virus concentrations were <45,000 copies/100 mg of bat feces. The diversified group 1 CoV shared a common ancestor with the human common cold virus hCoV-229E but not with hCoV-NL63, disputing hypotheses of common human descent. The most recent common ancestor of hCoV-229E and GhanaBt-CoVGrp1 existed in ≈1686-1800 ad. The GhanaBt-CoVGrp2 shared an old ancestor (≈2,400 years) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-like group of CoV.","C oronaviruses (CoVs) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) are enveloped viruses with plus-stranded RNA genomes of 26-32 kb, the largest contiguous RNA genomes in nature (1) . They are classified into 3 groups, which contain viruses pathogenic for mammals (groups 1 and 2) and poultry (group 3) (1). Hu-man CoVs (hCoVs)-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 are endemic worldwide and cause mainly respiratory infections in children and adults. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic coronavirus that caused an international epidemic in 2002-2003. Fortunately, efficient public health management interrupted this epidemic (2) . Studies conducted in China in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic have identified CoVs in bats (Chiroptera) and implicated this speciose mammalian order as the most likely reservoir of all known coronaviruses (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Among the most urgent concerns prompted by the SARS epidemic is the likelihood of similar future events. Thus, it seems highly relevant to study the ecology of bat CoVs in terms of diversity, host restriction, virus prevalence, risk of exposure, and the circumstances of past host transition events."
Interfering Waves of Adaptation Promote Spatial Mixing,"A fundamental problem of asexual adaptation is that beneficial substitutions are not efficiently accumulated in large populations: Beneficial mutations often go extinct because they compete with one another in going to fixation. It has been argued that such clonal interference may have led to the evolution of sex and recombination in well-mixed populations. Here, we study clonal interference, and mechanisms of its mitigation, in an evolutionary model of spatially structured populations with uniform selection pressure. Clonal interference is much more prevalent with spatial structure than without, due to the slow wave-like spread of beneficial mutations through space. We find that the adaptation speed of asexuals saturates when the linear habitat size exceeds a characteristic interference length, which becomes shorter with smaller migration and larger mutation rate. The limiting speed is proportional to m 1/2 and m 1/3 in linear and planar habitats, respectively, where the mutational supply m is the product of mutation rate and local population density. This scaling and the existence of a speed limit should be amenable to experimental tests as they fall far below predicted adaptation speeds for well-mixed populations (that scale as the logarithm of population size). Finally, we show that not only recombination, but also long-range migration is a highly efficient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition in structured populations. Our conservative estimates of the interference length predict prevalent clonal interference in microbial colonies and biofilms, so clonal competition should be a strong driver of both genetic and spatial mixing in those contexts.","O NE of the most basic questions of evolutionary biology that can be studied in controlled evolution experiments is: How fast do microbial populations adapt to new environments by the accumulation of beneficial mutations? Traditionally, it was thought that the accumulation process is limited by the supply of beneficial mutations (Novick and Szilard 1950; Atwood et al. 1951) . If a rare beneficial mutation arises and becomes sufficiently frequent, it will expand rapidly until it is present in all individuals of the population. After the completion of such a selective sweep, the population is stationary again until the next beneficial mutation arises. The accumulation rate of beneficial mutation should thus be controlled by the appearance of new beneficial mutations, which is proportional to the population size and the mutation rate (Sniegowski and Gerrish 2010) . This scenario of ""periodic selection"" crucially rests on the assumption that mutation rates are so small that beneficial mutations occur strictly sequentially. Evolution experiments of the last decade have shown, however, that beneficial mutation rates in microbes can be as large as 5 · 10 25 per genome per generation in the bacterium Escherichia coli with typical fitness effects in the range of a few percent Perfeito et al. 2007; Sniegowski and Gerrish 2010) . These high mutation rates have severely restricted the parameter range of periodic selection. Multiple selective sweeps, simultaneously in progress, are characteristic of a well-mixed microbial population containing .10 4 cells (see, e.g., estimates in Appendix D). In the past, most evolution experiments had effective population sizes exceeding this threshold, including the Lenski experiment, in which the bacterium E. coli was evolved for .50,000 generations to adapt to minimal medium (De Visser et al. 1999; Miralles et al. 1999 ; Barrick et al. 2009 ). Accordingly, these experiments did not reveal a linear relation between adaptation speed and population size, but instead a much weaker dependence indicative of a mechanism of ""diminishing returns"" (De Visser et al. 1999; Shaver et al. 2002) . The reason for this behavior is that multiple beneficial mutations arise on different genetic backgrounds simultaneously and compete with one another for sweeping through the population. As a consequence, only a small number of arising beneficial mutations can go to fixation, and most of them are lost in the competition between clones. It was first noted by Fisher (1930) and Muller (1932) that sex relaxes clonal competition and speeds up the process of adaptation as it allows beneficial mutations to be combined in a single genome even if they first appeared in different lineages. Today, this Fisher-Muller advantage of sex is one of the most important explanation for why most organisms engage in some form of genetic exchange."
,"We isolated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) from brain samples of 2 seals with lethal encephalitis at Weihai Aquarium, Weihai, China, in 2017. We confirmed our findings by immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis showed this virus was genotype I. Our findings suggest that JEV might disseminate though infected zoo animals.","J apanese encephalitis is a mosquitoborne zoonotic viral disease caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV; family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus).

The polyprotein consists of 3 structural proteins designated capsid, membrane, and envelope (E) and 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (1) . JEVs are classified into 5 genotypes (I-V) on the basis of the E gene sequence. Of these 5 genotypes, genotype I is the main type circulating in Asia (2) ."
The Effects of Ozone on Immune Function,"A review of the literature reveals that ozone (03) exposure can either suppress or enhance immune responsiveness. These disparate effects elicited by 0 exposure depend, in large part, on the experimental design used, the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied.","Broadly defined, the function of the immune system is to protect the body from damage by infectious microorganisms and neoplastic cells. The immune response is mediated by a variety of soluble factors and cells grouped according to their capacity to mediate innate (natural) or adaptive (acquired) immune responses. Innate immunity is primarily dependent on the phagocytic effector mechanisms (induding humoral factors such as complement, lysozyme, etc.), which are neither specific for particular infectious agents nor improved by repeated encounters with the same agent. Acquired immunity is specific for the inducing agent and is marked by an enhanced response upon repeated encounters with that agent, thus displaying memory. These systems do not function independently since innate and acquired immune mechanisms can interact; specific antibodies enhance the phagocytic ingestion process and cell-mediated immune responses increase the intracellular microbicidal and tumoricidal capabilities of the phagocytes. Both innate and acquired immune responses and the cells that carry out these processes are regulated by soluble factors such as cytokines and various autocoids."
P1 Infusion of sodium sulfide improves myocardial and endothelial function in a canine model of cardiopulmonary bypass P2 Cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of hydrogen sulfide in macrophages and mice,"Hydrogen sulfide is produced endogenously by a variety of enzymes involved in cysteine metabolism. Clinical data indicate that endogenous levels of hydrogen sulfide are diminished in various forms of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of hydrogen sulfide supplementation on cardiac function during reperfusion in a clinically relevant experimental model of cardiopulmonary bypass. Twelve anesthetized dogs underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. After 60 minutes of hypothermic cardiac arrest, reperfusion was started after application of either saline vehicle (control, n = 6), or the sodium sulfide infusion (1 mg/kg/hour, n = 6). Biventricular hemodynamic variables were measured by combined pressure-volume-conductance catheters. Coronary and pulmonary blood flow, vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and sodiumnitroprusside and pulmonary function were also determined. Administration of sodium sulfide led to a significantly better recovery of left and right ventricular systolic function (P < 0.05) after 60 minutes of reperfusion. Coronary blood flow was also significantly higher in the sodium sulfide-treated group (P < 0.05). Sodium sulfide treatment improved coronary blood flow, and preserved the acetylcholine-induced increases in coronary and pulmonary blood (P < 0.05). Myocardial ATP levels were markedly improved in the sulfide-treated group. Thus, supplementation of sulfide improves the recovery of myocardial and endothelial function and energetic status after hypothermic cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary bypass. These beneficial effects occurred without any detectable adverse hemodynamic or cardiovascular effects of sulfide at the dose used in the current study.","Introduction Extracellular release of ATP is an important modulator of immune response. ATP plasma concentration is increased in sepsis [1] . IFNγ plays a critical role in host defense by promoting Th1 phenotype and bacterial clearance. Low IFNγ levels are associated with the Th2 phenotype consistent with critical illness anergy [2] . It has been reported that 100 and 300 mM ATP increased LPS/PHA-stimulated IL-10 secretion in human blood [3] . Higher IL-10/IFNγ ratio shifts the immune phenotype from Th1 to Th2 response. We studied the effect of ATP on LPS-stimulated IL-10 and IFNγ secretion in a standardized ex-vivo whole human blood culture. Methods Venous blood from 10 healthy volunteers was drawn into tubes containing 10 ng LPS/ml (ILCSÒ; EDI GmBH, Reutlingen, Germany) and incubated with or without 100 mM ATP, respectively, at 37°C for 24 hours. The supernates were separated and frozen at -20°C. Cytokine levels were analysed on a robotic workstation (epMotion 5075; Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) in duplicate using the ELISA Cytokine kit (Luminex; Biosource Int., Camarillo, CA, USA). Results Added ATP reduced the mean concentration of IFNγ in LPSstimulated blood from 1,206 ± 1,667 pg/ml to 140 ± 128 pg/ml; P = 0.006. There was no consistent effect of ATP on IL-10 secretion in our study (21.6 ± 16.9 pg/ml to 17.2 ± 18.8 pg/ml). Interestingly, three subjects of Indian/Indonesian origin had IL-10 levels below the assay detection limit. The mean IL-10/IFNγ ratio was increased from 0.05 ± 0.04 to 0.16 ± 0.09 in the remaining Caucasian subjects (P = 0.015). See Figure 1 . Conclusions Our results suggest an immunosuppressive effect of extracellular ATP that is evident by the decrease of IFNγ and therefore the relative shift of the immune response towards Th2 phenotype. Although this may represent a self-protective mechanism, it may contribute to critical illness anergy. "
Torsional restraint: a new twist on frameshifting pseudoknots,"mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 PRF). Though we previously presented a model for how mRNA pseudoknots might activate the mechanism for À1 PRF, it did not address the question of the role that they may play in positioning the mRNA relative to the ribosome in this process [E. P. Plant, (2003) RNA, 9, 168-174]. A separate 'torsional restraint' model suggests that mRNA pseudoknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes directed to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery site positioned at the ribosome's A-and P-decoding sites [J. D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115-1127. Here, experiments using a series of 'pseudo-pseudoknots' having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model. The results of this study support the mechanistic hypothesis that À1 ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced by torsional resistance of the mRNA pseudoknot.","The structure of an RNA molecule is widely recognized to play a role in many processes, including structurally organizing complex RNAs, the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and in translational recoding and regulation [reviewed in (1) ]. One common RNA folding motifs is a pseudoknot, the folding back of a single-stranded RNA onto itself to form two helical structures with single-stranded loops joining them (2) . Many such structures can be inferred from RNA sequences and frameshifting function has been demonstrated for some of these [reviewed in (3) (4) (5) ]. However, though much theoretical progress has been made in understanding how mRNA pseudoknots promote efficient À1 ribosomal frameshifting (6), a complete understanding of this mechanism remains untested."
"Genetic Characterization of Coronaviruses from Domestic Ferrets, Japan",We detected ferret coronaviruses in 44 (55.7%) of 79 pet ferrets tested in Japan and classified the viruses into 2 genotypes on the basis of genotype-specific PCR. Our results show that 2 ferret coronaviruses that cause feline infectious peritonitis-like disease and epizootic catarrhal enteritis are enzootic among ferrets in Japan.,"A n epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) was first recognized in domestic ferrets (Mustelo putorius furo) in the United States in 2000 (1) . The causative agent of ECE was demonstrated to be a novel ferret coronavirus (FRCoV) belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus (1, 2) . Ferrets with ECE showed general clinical signs of lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting and had foul-smelling, green mucous-laden diarrhea. A systemic infection of ferrets closely resembling feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was subsequently reported among ferrets in the United States and Europe. The causative agent was also shown to be an Alphacoronavirus, which was named ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) (3, 4) ; this virus was found to be genetically distinct from those associated with ECE and from 2 viruses assigned to different genotypes (5) . Other cases of ECE and ferret infectious peritonitis have since been described in the United States and in Europe (2) (3) (4) 6, 7) . One case of pathology-confirmed FIP-like disease has been described among domestic ferrets in Japan (8) . The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of coronavirus among domestic ferrets seen by veterinarians in various parts of Japan."

Epidemiological and clinical features of human coronavirus infections among different subsets of patients,"Background Epidemiological and clinical data of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) infections are restricted to span 1-3 years at most. We conducted a comprehensive 9-year study on HCoVs by analyzing 1137 respiratory samples from four subsets of patients (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) in São Paulo, Brazil.","The genus Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a variety of livestock, poultry, and companion animals, in which they can cause serious and often fatal respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. 1 The first reports on human coronaviruses (HCoVs) appeared in the mid-1960s. The human viruses were isolated from persons with the common cold, and two species were detected: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. 2 Almost 40 years later, an emergent HCoV was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 While SARS-CoV was eradicated from the human population after a highly effective global public health response, 4 its emergence necessitated a rethinking of the role that CoVs play as a potential cause of more than just the common cold. Thereafter, there was an increase in research on HCoVs worldwide, which has led to the discovery of two other HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV-HKU1 in China. 5, 6 Reports have documented that HCoVs are involved in a wide spectrum of clinical presentation in upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] as well as being a contributor to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 16 and among patients presenting cystic fibrosis. 17 The involvement of other non-respiratory organ systems is still controversial but can occur, for example the enteric and nervous systems. 18, 19 Additionally, the role of HCoV infections among susceptible groups, outbreaks, and fatal cases has been documented. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] However, the majority of reports describe HCoV infections only among children. Moreover, longitudinal studies of CoV epidemiology in the literature are lacking and are restricted to descriptions spanning 1-3 years at most. [26] [27] [28] In this study, we conducted a comprehensive 9-year study of the epidemiological and clinical features of all four circulating HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63) among four different subsets (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) of adult and child patients."
Mathematical Biology Model-consistent estimation of the basic reproduction number from the incidence of an emerging infection,"We investigate the merit of deriving an estimate of the basic reproduction number R 0 early in an outbreak of an (emerging) infection from estimates of the incidence and generation interval only. We compare such estimates of R 0 with estimates incorporating additional model assumptions, and determine the circumstances under which the different estimates are consistent. We show that one has to be careful when using observed exponential growth rates to derive an estimate of R 0 , and we quantify the discrepancies that arise.","The basic reproduction number R 0 of an infectious agent is defined as the expected number of secondary cases caused by one typical infected individual in a population consisting of susceptibles only [3, 6, 7] . When an outbreak has started and the approximation that the population is fully susceptible no longer holds, one generally refers to the effective reproduction number R. The value of R 0 is, as a rule, different for different infectious agents and depends among other things on the characteristics of the population that the agent invades. Given this, it is not immediate that one can adopt previously determined values or size ranges for a new outbreak, unless many of the complicated characteristics of, for example, population composition and contact structure are comparable. For various reasons one can be interested in the value of R 0 or R early in an outbreak and during the outbreak. Notably, under a homogeneous mixing assumption, the values give insight into the extent of the control problem and a means of calculating how much control effort is needed."
Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency,Background: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability. The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts.,"Past [1] and present [2] national initiatives that promote electronic health records (EHRs), also advocate for the electronic exchange of data across various healthcare sectors using nationally recommended standards [3] . The critical role of public health, in the context of disease surveillance is recognized by these regulations, with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). ELR refers to the electronic transmission of labs related to reportable conditions to public health [4] . The emphasis on interoperability in recent legislations [5] and roadmaps [6] is facilitating the focus on electronic movement of data across healthcare settings. Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. Given this landscape, it is essential to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on quality of data being transmitted, as this is a crucial step in interoperability. In addition, this holds broad implications for future priority transactions such as electronic case reporting to public health."
An Updated Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method for Rapid Diagnosis of H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses,"We designed a new set of primers for reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to specifically amplify the HA gene of avian influenza viruses subtype H5N1. By testing nine H5N1 virus strains and 41 clinical samples collected in Northern Vietnam, we found that the new primers showed higher sensitivity and specificity than the previously published RT-LAMP primers and were comparable to the RT-PCR method currently recommended by WHO. These results suggest that our RT-LAMP assay may be a better choice as a diagnostic tool for current H5N1 influenza virus infection.","The infection of avian populations with certain subtypes of avian influenza A virus poses a continuous global human public health risk of a sporadic human zoonotic infection and emergence of a pandemic influenza strain. Human infection with one of these novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses was first recognized during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong S.A.R. of China. Since 2003, outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N1) have occurred among poultry in Asia, Europe and Africa, and human infections with this subtype are continuing [1] . The consequences have worsened with 382 infected human cases and 241 deaths as of April, 2008 [2] . Millions of avian species have been lost by culling, imposing a huge economical burden on developing countries. The ongoing circulation of avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in areas of Asia and Africa and the continued human infection with this subtype emphasize the need to enforce a diagnostic protocol for rapid and sensitive detection of the infections. Several methods have been used for A(H5N1) diagnosis in reference laboratories including PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR, especially a conventional RT-PCR method using specific primers as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3] ."
Protein Disulfide Isomerase and Host-Pathogen Interaction,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by immunological cells is known to cause damage to pathogens. Increasing evidence accumulated in the last decade has shown, however, that ROS (and redox signals) functionally regulate different cellular pathways in the host-pathogen interaction. These especially affect (i) pathogen entry through protein redox switches and redox modification (i.e., intra-and interdisulfide and cysteine oxidation) and (ii) phagocytic ROS production via Nox family NADPH oxidase enzyme and the control of phagolysosome function with key implications for antigen processing. The protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family of redox chaperones is closely involved in both processes and is also implicated in protein unfolding and trafficking across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and towards the cytosol, a thiol-based redox locus for antigen processing. Here, we summarise examples of the cellular association of host PDI with different pathogens and explore the possible roles of pathogen PDIs in infection. A better understanding of these complex regulatory steps will provide insightful information on the redox role and coevolutional biological process, and assist the development of more specific therapeutic strategies in pathogen-mediated infections.","Host cells have the ability to cope with the progression and severity of infection in response to different types of pathogen. On the other hand, numerous mechanisms have evolved that support the use of the host cell machinery to facilitate pathogen survival and multiplication. Such co-evolutionary processes are directly affected by different physicochemical factors within different cell compartments, both in the host and in pathogen. For instance, pH critically affects antigen stability of the influenza virus which modulates endosome acidity that attenuates its own infection [1] . ROS (and Reactive Nitrogen Species) production and the redox state of different cell compartments are also critically involved in cellular hostparasite interaction. Among the many redox sensitive proteins that are altered during the course of different infections, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI-) mediated redox switches have been associated with pathogen attachment-internalization, antigen processing in the ER/phagosome, and the regulation of ROS production by Nox family enzymes. Thus, PDI emerges as a ubiquitous redox protein that regulates different steps of diverse infection processes. Several pathogens also have their own PDI that act as an important virulence factor (Table 1 ). Other redox modifications directly mediated by ROS and especially via nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is abundant in phagocytic cells, have been reviewed elsewhere [2, 3] and are not considered in this article. Below, the main cellular redox aspects of host and pathogen PDI will be discussed."
"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Transmission in Extended Family, Saudi Arabia, 2014","Risk factors for human-to-human transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are largely unknown. After MERS-CoV infections occurred in an extended family in Saudi Arabia in 2014, relatives were tested by using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and serologic methods. Among 79 relatives, 19 (24%) were MERS-CoV positive; 11 were hospitalized, and 2 died. Eleven (58%) tested positive by rRT-PCR; 8 (42%) tested negative by rRT-PCR but positive by serology. Compared with MERS-CoV-negative adult relatives, MERS-CoV-positive adult relatives were older and more likely to be male and to have chronic medical conditions. Risk factors for household transmission included sleeping in an index patient's room and touching respiratory secretions from an index patient. Casual contact and simple proximity were not associated with transmission. Serology was more sensitive than standard rRT-PCR for identifying infected relatives, highlighting the value of including serology in future investigations.","M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first reported in September 2012 in a patient in Saudi Arabia (1, 2) .

Oxidative tissue injury in multiple sclerosis is only partly reflected in experimental disease models,"activity but very little p22phox or iNOS expressions. Active inflammatory demyelinating lesions induced by CD8 + T cells or by innate immunity showed macrophage and microglial activation together with the expression of p22phox, but low or absent iNOS reactivity. We corroborated the differences between acute CD4 + T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and acute MS lesions via gene expression studies. Furthermore, agedependent iron accumulation and lesion-associated iron liberation, as occurring in the human brain, were only minor in rodent brains. Our study shows that oxidative injury and its triggering mechanisms diverge in different models of rodent central nervous system inflammation. The amplification of oxidative injury, which has been suggested in MS, is only reflected to a limited degree in the studied rodent models.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) leading to focal plaques of primary demyelination in the white and grey matter, with astrocytic scar formation and profound axonal and neuronal degeneration [46] . recent studies, including the same cases of autopsy tissue as the current study, suggest that oxidative injury may play a major role in the pathogenesis of MS [47] . In active lesions of the white matter and the cerebral cortex, demyelination and neurodegeneration were associated with the presence of oxidised lipids (oxidised phospholipids and malonedialdehyde) in myelin, apoptotic oligodendrocytes [33] and degenerating axons and neurons [26, 33] . Furthermore, nuclei of degenerating glia cells and neurons contained oxidised DNA [33] . Oxidative injury was associated with inflammation and oxidative burst in activated microglia and macrophages expressing p22phox as an essential subunit of NADPH oxidases [25, 26] . Mitochondrial injury [11, 54] as well as accumulation of iron in the ageing brain and its liberation from intracellular stores in active MS lesions [35] was suggested to further amplify the oxidative injury."
,"A retrospective viral load study was performed on clinical specimens from 154 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); the specimens were prospectively collected during patients' illness. Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 142) from day 10 to day 15 after onset of symptoms was associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and death. Serum viral load (n = 53) was associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, and death. Stool viral load (n = 94) was associated with diarrhea, and urine viral load (n = 111) was associated with abnormal urinalysis results. Viral replications at different sites are important in the pathogenesis of clinical and laboratory abnormalities of SARS.","mechanical ventilation; laboratory evidence of lymphopenia, renal impairment, liver dysfunction, or abnormal urinalysis during the first 15 days; and death. Diarrhea was defined as bowel movements >3 times per day for 2 consecutive days. Oxygen desaturation was defined as <90% oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry while breathing room air. Some of these patients later required mechanical ventilation. Hepatic dysfunction was defined as a mean level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or both, greater than the upper limit of normal from day 10 to day 15 after onset of symptoms. Impaired renal function was defined as a serum creatinine level higher than the reference range on 2 consecutive days. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count <1,000/µL on 2 consecutive days. Abnormal urinalysis results were defined as proteinuria (>30 mg/dL), microscopic hematuria (>10 erythrocytes/µL), pyuria (>50 leukocytes/µL) on a dipstick test, or casts in urine (Combur Test, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) examined with inverted microscope by an experienced technician."
Geometry and Adhesion of Extracellular Domains of DC-SIGNR Neck Length Variants Analyzed by ForceÀDistance Measurements,"ForceÀdistance measurements have been used to examine differences in the interaction of the dendritic cell glycan-binding receptor DC-SIGN and the closely related endothelial cell receptor DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN) with membranes bearing glycan ligands. The results demonstrate that upon binding to membraneanchored ligand, DC-SIGNR undergoes a conformational change similar to that previously observed for DC-SIGN. The results also validate a model for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR derived from crystallographic studies. Force measurements were performed with DC-SIGNR variants that differ in the length of the neck that result from genetic polymorphisms, which encode different numbers of the 23-amino acid repeat sequences that constitute the neck. The findings are consistent with an elongated, relatively rigid structure of the neck repeat observed in crystals. In addition, differences in the lengths of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR extracellular domains with equivalent numbers of neck repeats support a model in which the different dispositions of the carbohydrate-recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR result from variations in the sequences of the necks.","T he human glycan-binding receptors DC-SIGN (dendriticcell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 1-grabbing nonintegrin; CD209) and DC-SIGNR (DC-SIGN-related receptor, also designated as L-SIGN, CD209L, and CD299) share overall sequence identity of 77% and arose by a relatively recent gene duplication within the primate lineage. DC-SIGN is expressed on dendritic cells and some macrophages, while DC-SIGNR is expressed on endothelial cells in the liver and lymph node sinusoids and in cells lining placental capillaries. 1À3 Expression of these receptors on distinct cell types suggests that they have potentially different functions. Both bind to the T-cell surface receptor ICAM-3 1,2 in order to facilitate infection of T cells by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 4 ) and act as primary receptors that mediate entry of Ebola virus into cells. 4, 5 However, they bind differentially to other pathogens. 6 For example, DC-SIGN plays a critical role in modulating the host response to schistosomal parasites, and it interacts with Helicobacter pylori, while DC-SIGNR facilitates infection of hepatocytes, by presenting hepatitis C virus on liver endothelial cells. 7 DC-SIGNR also promotes transmission of human immunodeficiency virus across the placenta. 8 These differences in the biological properties of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are mirrored by differences in their molecular properties. For example, although both receptors bind to highmannose oligosaccharides, these are the only glycans that are detected in glycan array analysis of DC-SIGNR, while the presence of key residues in the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN, particularly Val351, supports binding to fucosylated Lewis-type oligosaccharide structures as well. 9 Such differences probably explain why DC-SIGN binds to parasites that are rich in such structures, while DC-SIGNR does not. 10, 11 In addition to these differences in the ligand-binding domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, there appear to be significant but less well understood differences in their overall architectures ( Figure 1A ,B). In both receptors, the carbohydrate-recognition domains are projected from the cell surface by a neck domain comprising multiple copies of a 23-amino acid repeat sequence, but the number of copies of the repeat is largely fixed fixed at 7.5 in DC-SIGN, while polymorphisms in the gene for DC-SIGNR result in variant forms of the neck containing between 4.5 and 9.5 repeats. 12, 13 The allele frequency of the 7.5-repeat variant is over 50% in the human population, but the frequencies of the 6.5and 5.5-repeat variants are 12À16% and 26À37%, respectively. Different neck-length genotypes have been associated with variations in susceptibility to certain viral infections. The 7.5-repeat form is more common in HIV-infected individuals than in uninfected individuals. 14 However, this correlation with HIV susceptibility has not been observed in all cases. 12 The presence of 4.5repeat and 9.5-repeat variants correlates with decreased viral load in hepatitis C virus infection. 15 The shorter necks are also associated with diminished rates of SARS coronavirus infection. 16 It is also noteworthy that the neck repeat adjacent to the CRD of DC-SIGNR differs significantly in sequence from the Biochemistry ARTICLE corresponding sequence in DC-SIGN. Recent structural analysis of a truncated form of the neck domain of DC-SIGNR, combined with a structure of the final neck repeat attached to the CRD, has indicated that a phenylalanine in the final neck repeat of DC-SIGNR causes the polypeptides forming the necks to splay apart at this point. 17 In DC-SIGN, the presence of a valine residue at this position suggests that the neck could remain packed as they are in the other neck repeats, thereby placing the CRDs closer to each other. Thus, differences in the neck regions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR may also contribute to differences in their interactions with pathogens."
Ultrastructural Characterization of SARS Coronavirus EMERGENCE OF SARS,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first described during a 2002-2003 global outbreak of severe pneumonia associated with human deaths and person-toperson disease transmission. The etiologic agent was initially identified as a coronavirus by thin-section electron microscopic examination of a virus isolate. Virions were spherical, 78 nm in mean diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. We show that infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus resulted in distinct ultrastructural features: double-membrane vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and large granular areas of cytoplasm. These three structures and the coronavirus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and RNA by using ultrastructural immunogold and in situ hybridization assays. In addition, ultrastructural examination of a bronchiolar lavage specimen from a SARS patient showed numerous coronavirus-infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells. Electron microscopic studies were critical in identifying the etiologic agent of the SARS outbreak and in guiding subsequent laboratory and epidemiologic investigations.","A large outbreak of severe pneumonia associated with human deaths occurred in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. Beginning in late February 2003, a similar illness was reported concurrently in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, and other countries (1, 2) . The disease, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), causes an influenzalike illness with fever, cough, dyspnea, and headache. Person-to-person transmission, combined with international travel of infected persons, accelerated the worldwide spread of the illness. By the time the outbreak was contained, 8,098 probable cases, resulting in 774 deaths, were identified in 29 countries (3) ."

Environmental and non-infectious factors in the aetiology of pharyngitis (sore throat),"The aim of this review is to examine the causes, pathophysiology and experimental models of noninfectious pharyngitis (sore throat). Introduction The causes of sore throat can be infectious (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) or non-infectious, although the relative proportion of each is not well documented. Methods A PubMed database search was performed for studies of non-infectious sore throat. Results and conclusions Non-infectious causes of sore throat include: physico-chemical factors, such as smoking, snoring, shouting, tracheal intubation, medications, or concomitant illness; and environmental factors including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, temperature and humidity, and hazardous or occupational irritants. The pathophysiology underlying non-infectious sore throat is largely uncharacterised, although neurogenic inflammation looks to be a promising candidate. It is likely that there will be individual disposition factors or the coincidence of more than one irritant with possible-up to now unknown-interactions between them. Therefore, experimental models with defined conditions and objective endpoints are needed. A new model using cold dry air to directly induce pharyngeal irritation in humans, with pharyngeal lavage to measure biomarkers, may provide a useful tool for the study of mechanisms and treatment of non-infectious sore throat.","Pharyngitis is inflammation of the oropharynx. It is commonly referred to as sore throat, although this term is often used imprecisely and is poorly defined. Hence, whilst sore throat may be the symptom described by the patient, examination might also reveal nasopharyngitis (that is, including the nasopharyngeal mucosa). The exact site of the irritation/inflammation is often not identified, with some studies relying on a patient-reported diagnosis (that is, 'sore throat'). These factors potentially complicate the study (and treatment) of sore throat. The following review will focus on sore throat as the primary symptom, which implies reported irritation and pain caused by inflammation and/or irritation of the oro (medium part) and hypopharynx (lower part of the pharynx). As mentioned, there exist also overlapping symptoms to nasopharyngitis (upper part of the pharynx) but rhinitis or rhinosinusitis are usually diagnosed in those patients and sore throat is not the primary symptom."
Multiple functions of USP18,"Since the discovery of the ubiquitin system and the description of its important role in the degradation of proteins, many studies have shown the importance of ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs). One special member of this family is the USP18 protein (formerly UBP43). In the past two decades, several functions of USP18 have been discovered: this protein is not only an isopeptidase but also a potent inhibitor of interferon signaling. Therefore, USP18 functions as 'a' maestro of many biological pathways in various cell types. This review outlines multiple functions of USP18 in the regulation of various immunological processes, including pathogen control, cancer development, and autoimmune diseases.","Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) is known as an ISG15 isopeptidase and a negative regulator of type I and type III interferon signaling. 1, 2 The Usp18 gene was originally called Ubp43 because it encodes a 43-kDa protein homologous with ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs). It was first cloned by Liu et al. 3, 4 from mice expressing the leukemia fusion protein AML1-ETO and later by other groups from virus-infected porcine alveolar macrophages 5 and human melanoma cell lines. 6 The gene and protein were renamed Usp18 and USP18, respectively, according to the systematic nomenclature suggested by Baker et al. 7 for UBPs and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins. On the basis of its amino-acid sequence, USP18 is a member of the USP family, which is responsible for removing ubiquitin or Ubl proteins from their conjugated substrates."
Cryo-electron microscopy structure of a coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer,"The tremendous pandemic potential of coronaviruses was demonstrated twice in the last decades by two global outbreaks of deadly pneumonia. Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions 1 . S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a murine coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 Å resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins 2,3 , implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.","coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 demonstrated that these zoonotic viruses can transmit to humans from various animal species and suggested that additional emergence events are likely to occur.

siVirus: web-based antiviral siRNA design software for highly divergent viral sequences,"siVirus (http://siVirus.RNAi.jp/) is a web-based online software system that provides efficient short interfering RNA (siRNA) design for antiviral RNA interference (RNAi). siVirus searches for functional, off-target minimized siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of divergent viral sequences. These siRNAs are expected to resist viral mutational escape, since their highly conserved targets likely contain structurally/functionally constrained elements. siVirus will be a useful tool for designing optimal siRNAs targeting highly divergent pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza virus and SARS coronavirus, all of which pose enormous threats to global human health.","RNA interference (RNAi) is now widely used to knockdown gene expression in a sequence-specific manner, making it a powerful tool not only for studying gene function, but also for therapeutic purposes, including antiviral treatments (1) (2) (3) (4) . Currently, the replication of a wide range of viruses can be inhibited successfully using RNAi, with both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and siRNA expression vectors (5) ."
,"The healthcare setting was important in the early spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in both Toronto and Taiwan. Healthcare workers, patients, and visitors were at increased risk for infection. Nonetheless, the ability of individual SARS patients to transmit disease was quite variable. Unrecognized SARS case-patients were a primary source of transmission, and early detection and intervention were important to limit spread. Strict adherence to infection control precautions was essential in containing outbreaks. In addition, grouping patients into cohorts and limiting access to SARS patients minimized exposure opportunities. Given the difficulty in implementing several of these measures, control measures were frequently adapted to the acuity of SARS care and level of transmission within facilities. Although these conclusions are based only on a retrospective analysis of events, applying the experiences of Toronto and Taiwan to SARS preparedness planning efforts will likely minimize future transmission within healthcare facilities.","I n March 2003, reports of healthcare workers with unexplained pneumonia in Vietnam initiated an international investigation of the infection that came to be known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1) . The cause of SARS was later identified as a coronavirus, which was cultured from specimens provided by a healthcare worker who subsequently died of SARS (2) . During the outbreak, transmission in hospitals and infection in healthcare workers persisted. In Toronto and Taiwan, nosocomial transmission played a substantial role in initiating and maintaining outbreaks of SARS. We summarize our experiences during these outbreaks to highlight key factors that can help healthcare and public health officials prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS. In addition, we offer conclusions based on an in-depth, retrospective analysis of the events as they unfolded in these two settings."

,"Knowledge about immunity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels is essential for infection control and vaccination. A longitudinal study of 11 dam-calf pairs showed that calves lose maternal MERS-CoV antibodies 5-6 months postparturition and are left susceptible to infection, indicating a short window of opportunity for vaccination.","I n 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged on the Arabian Peninsula (1) . As of February 2016 the virus has caused 1,638 human infections, including 587 deaths (2) . Zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV was suspected early on (3) . Dromedaries on the Arabian Peninsula and on the African continent have harbored MERS-CoV-specific antibodies for at least 20-30 years (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , long before the first human infections were recognized. Additionally, detection of MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences in throat swab specimens from camels confirmed the presence of the virus in these animals (8) . The existence of an active animal reservoir receives additional support by epidemiologic investigations that found no sustained human-to-human transmission in MERS-CoV-affected countries such as Saudi Arabia (9) ."
Supplementary Note 1,CATCH's framework for designing probes offers considerable flexibility. This note describes extensions to probe design and methods behind them.,"Probe-target hybridization CATCH reduces much of the design to a problem of determining probe-target hybridization. The function f map , which determines whether a probe hybridizes to a range in a target sequence (and, if it does, precisely the range), can be customized by a user in CATCH's source code or can be provided in a command-line argument to be dynamically loaded. For example, although by default CATCH does not use a thermodynamic model of hybridization, a user could choose to incorporate a calculation of free energy to evaluate the likelihood of hybridization. Here, when computing s(d, θ d ) (defined in Online Methods), CATCH's default f map is based on three parameters in θ d : a number m of mismatches to tolerate, a length lcf of a longest common substring, and a length i of an island of an exact match. f map computes the longest common substring with at most m mismatches between the probe sequence and target subsequence, and returns that the probe covers the target range if and only if the length of this is at least lcf. Optionally (if i > 0), f map additionally requires that the probe and target subsequence share an exact (0-mismatch) match of length at least i to return that the probe covers the range. (See Supplementary Fig. 1b for a visual representation and 'Exploring the parameter space across taxa' in Online Methods for example values.)

"Group A Streptococcus Strains Circulating during Scarlet Fever Epidemic, Beijing, China, 2011","Scarlet fever is one of a variety of diseases caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS). During 2011, a scarlet fever epidemic characterized by peak monthly incidence rates 2.9-6.7 times higher than those in 2006-2010 occurred in Beijing, China. During the epidemic, hospital-based enhanced surveillance for scarlet fever and pharyngitis was conducted to determine characteristics of circulating GAS strains. The surveillance identified 3,359 clinical cases of scarlet fever or pharyngitis. GAS was isolated from 647 of the patients; 76.4% of the strains were type emm12, and 17.1% were emm1. Almost all isolates harbored superantigens speC and ssa. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and resistance rates were 96.1% to erythromycin, 93.7% to tetracycline, and 79.4% to clindamycin. Because emm12 type GAS is not the predominant type in other countries, wider surveillance for the possible spread of emm12 type GAS from China to other countries is warranted.","S treptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a common human pathogen that can induce a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from noninvasive diseases, such as pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and impetigo, to invasive diseases, such as erysipelas, cellulitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome. Moreover, GAS can cause rheumatic fever and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (1, 2) . In the late1980s, a change in the epidemiology of invasive GAS diseases and the emergence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome were documented (3, 4) , and the current number of invasive GAS disease cases worldwide is high (2) ."
A universal BMV-based RNA recombination system-how to search for general rules in RNA recombination,"At present, there is no doubt that RNA recombination is one of the major factors responsible for the generation of new RNA viruses and retroviruses. Numerous experimental systems have been created to investigate this complex phenomenon. Consequently, specific RNA structural motifs mediating recombination have been identified in several viruses. Unfortunately, up till now a unified model of genetic RNA recombination has not been formulated, mainly due to difficulties with the direct comparison of data obtained for different RNA-based viruses. To solve this problem, we have attempted to construct a universal system in which the recombination activity of various RNA sequences could be tested. To this end, we have used brome mosaic virus, a model (1)RNA virus of plants, for which the structural requirements of RNA recombination are well defined. The effectiveness of the new homomolecular system has been proven in an experiment involving two RNA sequences derived from the hepatitis C virus genome. In addition, comparison of the data obtained with the homomolecular system with those generated earlier using the heteromolecular one has provided new evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different and depend on the virus' mode of replication.","RNA recombination is a very common phenomenon. It has been observed in all types of viruses using RNA as a carrier of genetic information: in positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (1) (2) (3) (4) , in negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (5, 6) , in double-stranded RNA viruses (7, 8) and in retroviruses (9) (10) (11) . Moreover, it has been shown that RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material not only between the same or similar viruses but also between distinctly different viruses (12) . Sometimes it also permits crossovers between viral and host RNA (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Taking into account the structure of viral genomic molecules and the location of crossover sites, three basic types of RNA recombination were distinguished: homologous, aberrant homologous and non-homologous (3, 4, 18) . The former two occur between two identical or similar RNAs (or between molecules displaying local homology), while the latter involves two different molecules. Most of the collected data suggest that RNA recombinants are formed according to a copy choice model (4, 18) . A viral replication complex starts nascent RNA strand synthesis on one template, called RNA donor and then switches to another template, called RNA acceptor. Accordingly, two main factors are thought to affect RNA recombination: the structure of recombining molecules and the ability of the viral replicase to switch templates."

"Capacity of Public Health Surveillance to Comply with Revised International Health Regulations, USA Author affi liations: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","Public health surveillance is essential for detecting and responding to infectious diseases and necessary for compliance with the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. To assess reporting capacities and compliance with IHR of all 50 states and Washington, DC, we sent a questionnaire to respective epidemiologists; 47 of 51 responded. Overall reporting capacity was high. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported being able to transmit notifi cations about unknown or unexpected events to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) daily. Additionally, 80% of respondents reported use of a risk assessment tool to determine whether CDC should be notifi ed of possible public health emergencies. These fi ndings suggest that most states have systems in place to ensure compliance with IHR. However, full state-level compliance will require additional efforts.","T he 2005 revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) were a major global policy achievement to ensure international recognition and notifi cation of unusual public health events. These regulations are an international legal instrument that binds 194 countries (World Health Organization [WHO] member states). The goal of IHR 2005 is to help the international community prevent or respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten the global population. As seen with the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, diseases have the potential to spread quickly around the globe through international travel and trade (1) . Member states are required to report certain diseases and public health events to WHO. Furthermore, the rights and obligations of member states are defi ned to establish procedures that WHO must follow to uphold global public health security (2) ."
Sialic acid tissue distribution and influenza virus tropism,"Avian influenza A viruses exhibit a strong preference for using a2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor. Until recently, the presumed lack of this receptor in human airways was believed to constitute an efficient barrier to avian influenza A virus infection of humans. Recent zoonotic outbreaks of avian influenza A virus have triggered researchers to analyse tissue distribution of sialic acid in further detail. Here, we review and extend the current knowledge about sialic acid distribution in human tissues, and discuss viruses with ocular tropism and their preference for a2,3linked sialic acid.","Influenza viruses, members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, are enveloped viruses with segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA packaged in virions as ribonucleoproteins. Influenza viruses are further classified into three genera, A, B and C, on the basis of the antigenic diversity of virion proteins such as the matrix protein (M1) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). Further classification is based on the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins protruding from the viral envelope of influenza A and B viruses. Human influenza viruses mainly cause acute respiratory disease with high incidence and mortality, usually as epidemics but sometimes as worldwide pandemics. To date, 16 different influenza A virus HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine different NA subtypes (N1-N9) have been identified in wild waterfowl, which are the major reservoir of all influenza A viruses. All mammalian influenza viruses are believed to originate from avian influenza A viruses, and only three subtypes of influenza A virus, H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2, have adapted to humans since 1918. 1 The causative viruses of the 1957 Asian (H2N2) and 1968 Hong Kong (H3N2) pandemics were found to be reassortants of human and avian influenza A viruses, 2,3 whereas the 1918 Spanish (H1N1) influenza A virus was likely to be entirely of avian origin but adapted to humans. 4 When H1N1 reappeared in 1977, H3N2 did not disappear but continued to circulate; therefore, currently, together with their H1N2 reassortant, three subtypes of influenza A virus are associated with epidemics. The ongoing zoonotic outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza A virus have raised concerns that the situation may develop into a pandemic comparable in magnitude with the Spanish influenza virus pandemic."
Mechanisms of viral entry: sneaking in the front door,"Recent developments in methods to study virus internalisation are providing clearer insights into mechanisms used by viruses to enter host cells. The use of dominant negative constructs, specific inhibitory drugs and RNAi to selectively prevent entry through particular pathways has provided evidence for the clathrin-mediated entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well as the caveolar entry of Simian Virus 40. Moreover, the ability to image and track fluorescent-labelled virus particles in real-time has begun to challenge the classical plasma membrane entry mechanisms described for poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus. This review will cover both well-documented entry mechanisms as well as more recent discoveries in the entry pathways of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. This will include viruses which enter the cytosol directly at the plasma membrane and those which enter via endocytosis and traversal of internal membrane barrier(s). Recent developments in imaging and inhibition of entry pathways have provided insights into the ill-defined entry mechanism of HCV, bringing it to the forefront of viral entry research. Finally, as high-affinity receptors often define viral internalisation pathways, and tropism in vivo, host membrane proteins to which viral particles specifically bind will be discussed throughout.","Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and entry into the host cell is a critical step in the viral life cycle. Cellular membranes present a barrier between the viral particle and intracellular site(s) of replication in the cytosol or nucleus. While enveloped viruses are bound by a lipid bilayer, nonenveloped viruses are surrounded by a proteinaceous capsid. Both enveloped viruses and non-enveloped viruses have evolved complex and often poorly defined mechanisms to enter cells. Identification of host cell receptors and their trafficking pathways provide tools to study viral entry. Although this generally involves the endocytic processes of the host cell, the exact entry mechanisms of many medically important viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) , have yet to be fully elucidated."
Fatal respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus infection in a child with severe combined immunodeficiency,"Coronaviruses have been demonstrated to contribute substantially to respiratory tract infections among the child population. Though infected children commonly present mild upper airway symptoms, in high-risk patients with underlying conditions, particularly in immunocompromised children these pathogens may lead to severe lung infection and extrapulmonary disorders. In this paper, we provide the first report of the case of a 15-month-old child with severe combined immunodeficiency and coronavirus HKU1-related pneumonia with fatal respiratory distress syndrome.","Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of the most severe primary immunodeficiencies, characterized by the absence of functional T lymphocytes resulting in profound impairment of the cellular and humoral adaptive immunity. Depending on the genetic defect, B lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells may be present or absent and this feature constitutes the basis for the classical division into T-B + SCID and T-B)SCID, with further subdivisions into NK+ and NK) disorders. 1 Respiratory tract infection is a common manifestation in children in question and may be present within the neonatal period or in early infancy. Opportunistic pathogens may lead to rapidly progressive, fatal interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by hyperinflation resulting from small airway obstruction or to persistent bronchiolitic presentation. Apart from pyogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas spp, Burkholderia spp, as well as Mycobacteria and fungi, in particular Pneumocystis jiroveci, respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and other viruses -cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with severe pneumonia in SCID children. 2 Human coronaviruses (HCoV) HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 and related new strains HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, identified after the epidemic outbreak of severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, are likely to be common respiratory viruses in otherwise healthy children and were not implicated in severe lung infections in immunocompromised patients thus far. 3 In this report we present the case of a child with delayed-onset SCID and fatal respiratory coronavirus infection."
Characteristics of respiratory viral infections during influenza season in Canadian Hutterite Communities,Objectives: To determined the pathogen-specific incidence of respiratory virus infection in Hutterite communities occurring over the 2008-2009 influenza season and assess temporal characteristics of respiratory illness related to infection.,"Viral respiratory infections, particularly in young children and the elderly 1 , can lead to substantial morbidity, such as increased rates of lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalization. 2, 3 Relatively few prospective, communitybased studies to define etiologic agents for respiratory infection have been reported. [1] [2] [3] Moreover, existing studies are limited in that most are not prospective communitybased studies 1,4 and did not use highly sensitive diagnostic testing such as RT-PCR. 2 Data are particularly sparse on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses other than influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and parainfluenza, 5, 6 and most of these studies are based on culture, antigen testing or serology that are less sensitive and specific relative to molecular assays."
A facile inhibitor screening of SARS coronavirus N protein using nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide,"Hundreds of million people worldwide have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the rate of global death from SARS has remarkably increased. Hence, the development of efficient drug treatments for the biological effects of SARS is highly needed. We have previously shown that quantum dots (QDs)-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide is sensitive to the specific recognition of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein. In this study, we found that a designed biochip could analyze inhibitors of the SARS-CoV N protein using nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease that began in Guandong, China in November 2002. It has caused serious infections in many nations, such as Asia, Europe and Canada. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality of patients afflicted with SARS is 15% on average and 50% or higher in patients aged 65 years and over. 7 SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped and positively single-stranded RNA virus with a typical genome size of 29.7 kb. It encodes RNA-directed RNA polymerase and structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. [8] [9] [10] [11] The N protein is a 422 amino acids alkaline protein with a short lysine-rich region suggested as the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA. 12 The SARS-CoV N protein is a major pathological determinant in the host and might cause host cell apoptosis, upregulate the proinflammatory cytokine production, and block innate immune responses. Moreover, the N protein of the SARS-CoV is an important antigen for both the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases. 13 Since SARS broke out in 2003, researchers have made great efforts to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] In addition, due to its essential role in SARS replication, the SARS-CoV N protein is mainly regarded as a prime target for anti-SARS therapy. For this reason, the SARS-CoV N protein is an attractive and crucial target for anti-SARS therapeutic drug discovery."
,"We investigated the clinical manifestations and course of all probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in the Vietnam outbreak. Probable SARS cases were defined by using the revised World Health Organization criteria. We systematically reviewed medical records and undertook descriptive statistical analyses. All 62 patients were hospitalized. On admission, the most prominent symptoms were malaise (82.3%) and fever (79.0%). Cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath were present in approximately one quarter of the patients; 79.0% had lymphopenia; 40.3% had thrombocytopenia; 19.4% had leukopenia; and 75.8% showed changes on chest radiograph. Fever developed on the first day of illness onset, and both respiratory symptoms and radiographic changes occurred on day 4. On average, maximal radiographic changes were observed on day 10, and fevers subsided by day 13. Symptoms on admission were nonspecific, although fever, malaise, and lymphopenia were common. The complications of SARS included invasive intubation and ventilation (11.3%) and death (9.7%).","tries had reported 8,098 probable cases of SARS and 774 deaths (2) ."
Spike Protein Fusion Peptide and Feline Coronavirus Virulence,"Coronaviruses are well known for their potential to change their host or tissue tropism, resulting in unpredictable new diseases and changes in pathogenicity; severe acute respiratory syndrome and feline coronaviruses, respectively, are the most recognized examples. Feline coronaviruses occur as 2 pathotypes: nonvirulent feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs), which replicate in intestinal epithelium cells, and lethal feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs), which replicate in macrophages. Evidence indicates that FIPV originates from FECV by mutation, but consistent distinguishing differences have not been established. We sequenced the full genome of 11 viruses of each pathotype and then focused on the single most distinctive site by additionally sequencing hundreds of viruses in that region. As a result, we identifi ed 2 alternative amino acid differences in the putative fusion peptide of the spike protein that together distinguish FIPV from FECV in >95% of cases. By these and perhaps other mutations, the virus apparently acquires its macrophage tropism and spreads systemically.","C oronaviruses (subfamily Coronavirinae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses that infect mammals and birds. They are quite common and cause infections in humans and a wide variety of animals; infection typically results in respiratory or enteric disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged suddenly in 2002 and caused severe acute respiratory disease in humans, is the most notorious coronavirus. SARS-CoV spread rapidly around the globe, infecting thousands and killing ≈800 persons. The virus presumably originated from bats and was transmitted to humans either directly or by using civets or raccoon dogs as intermediate hosts (1, 2) ."
Managing Febrile Respiratory Illnesses during a Hypothetical SARS Outbreak,"Since the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) contained in July 2003, new cases have periodically reemerged in Asia. This situation has placed hospitals and health officials worldwide on heightened alert. In a future outbreak, rapidly and accurately distinguishing SARS from other common febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) could be difficult. We constructed a decision-analysis model to identify the most efficient strategies for managing undifferentiated FRIs within a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City during the season of respiratory infections. If establishing reliable epidemiologic links were not possible, societal costs would exceed $2.0 billion per month. SARS testing with existing polymerase chain reaction assays would have harmful public health and economic consequences if SARS made up <0.1% of circulating FRIs. Increasing influenza vaccination rates among the general population before the onset of respiratory season would save both money and lives.","O n July 5, 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that human chains of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had ended. Since then, new cases of SARS have resurfaced in Asia, including several in the absence of laboratory exposures. This reemergence of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has sparked international concern and has prompted heightened surveillance by hospitals and health officials worldwide. Such concerns have been amplified by fears that a future SARS outbreak could coincide with respiratory infection season, when influenza infections and other febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) develop in large segments of the population."
"4th Annual ELSO-SWAC Conference Proceedings Qatar ECMO program: Past, present, and future","The clarion call for setting up a Qatar adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program came during the MERS-CoV outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula region. 1 This carried a high mortality rate in those presenting with severe respiratory failure, and recent data from the ""CESAR Trial"" showed that treatment in a severe respiratory failure center with ECMO capabilities improved severe respiratory failure (SRF) patient survival. 2 Owing to the regional novelty of the program, potential partners of external well-established ECMO programs were sought. The model of care hinged on medical versus surgical ECMO delivery. The balance tipped in favor of a medical model in view of the prevailing nature of the pandemic outbreak at the time. There is plenty of evidence demonstrating that the intensivist-led ECMO cannulation model is safe. 3 The commissioning body also favored the notion of a severe respiratory failure outreach and retrieval service, delivered round-the-clock with the provision of on-site cannulation for ECMO and transportation thereafter. 4,5 In early 2013, an ECMO partnership with a UK-based academic healthcare system was established with the view to train and initially mirror the UK-based ECMO program with subsequent tailoring and localization to fit the local need in Qatar. Team members were chosen locally, who were physicians, nurses, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, nutritionists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and critical care paramedics. 6 These underwent ECMO (VV modality) simulation and hands-on training in London as well as cadaveric cannulation training in Berlin, Germany. After extensive training abroad, the team members returned to Qatar where further training through simulation was carried out. 7 This was supervised and signed off by the UK-based ECMO center. In April 2014, the first case qualifying for ECMO due to severe respiratory failure was treated at the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) ECMO center. Through the rest of 2014, the center was treating","one patient per month. The survival rate was 100%. The first ECMO retrieval occurred in October 2014. This was carried with no recorded incidents. The year 2015 saw ECMO team size expansion and consolidation through in-house simulation courses and the HMC ECMO center joining ELSO. By the end of 2015, the center had treated 25 patients with a recorded survival rate of 70%. The year 2016 witnessed the introduction of VA ECMO modality, and the first aeromedical ECMO transfer occurred in June that year. Towards the end of 2016, the center began an ECMO fellowship program and registered its participation in multicenter ECMO trials. By the end of 2016, the center had carried out 50 runs of ECMO, with 10 patients dying while on ECMO (20% mortality). The ECMO patient survival to ICU discharge was 70% and to hospital survival was 68%. The future direction of the HMC ECMO program is to play a role of an adult regional center of excellence with not only land, 8 but also aeromedical transport capability, and to consolidate on ECMO education and training, through simulation courses, for both static and transport modalities. 7 Other future directions are, through local partnership, build on pediatric and cardiac ECMO, to introduce neonatal ECMO programs."
,A recent report suggested that 2 novel bunyaviruses discovered in insects in Côte d'Ivoire caused lethal disease in swine in South Korea. We conducted cell culture studies and tested serum from pigs exposed to mosquitoes in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana and found no evidence for infection in pigs.,"O rthobunyaviruses and phleboviruses are transmitted to animals and humans by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes, sandflies, and ticks (1, 2) . Infection can cause systemic disease, including encephalitis or hemorrhagic fevers. Members of both genera of viruses encode a nonstructural (NS) protein that suppresses the antiviral interferon response of the vertebrate host (3, 4) . We recently discovered 2 novel prototypic bunyaviruses in mosquitoes in Côte d'Ivoire (5, 6) . Named Gouléako virus (GOLV) and Herbert virus (HEBV), the viruses tentatively define 2 novel bunyavirus-family genera that are in a sister relationship to the genera Phlebovirus and Orthobunyavirus, respectively. Neither virus encodes NS proteins, nor do the viruses infect vertebrate cells or cause disease in mice that have been intracerebrally inoculated with the viruses (5-7). Replication of both viruses is blocked at temperatures above 31°C, suggesting that the viruses are unlikely to infect mammals (8) ."
Interaction of short modiWed peptides deriving from glycoprotein gp36 of feline immunodeWciency virus with phospholipid membranes,"A tryptophan-rich octapeptide, C8 (Ac-Trp-Glu-Asp-Trp-Val-Gly-Trp-Ile-NH 2 ), modelled on the membrane-proximal external region of the feline immuno-deWciency virus (FIV) gp36 glycoprotein ectodomain, exhibits potent antiviral activity against FIV. A mechanism has been proposed by which the peptide, being positioned on the surface of the cell membrane, inhibits its fusion with the virus. In the present work, peptide-lipid interactions of C8 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes are investigated using electron spin resonance spectroscopy of spin-labelled lipids. Three other peptides, obtained from modiWcations of C8, have also been investigated, in an attempt to clarify the essential molecular features of the interactions involving the tryptophan residues. The results show that C8 adsorbs strongly on the bilayer surface. Membrane binding requires not only the presence of the Trp residues in the sequence, but also their common orientation on one side of the peptide that is engendered by the WX 2 WX 2 W motif. Membrane interaction correlates closely with peptide antiviral activity, indicating that the membrane is essential in stabilizing the peptide conformation that will be able to inhibit viral infection.","Both the human immunodeWciency virus (HIV) and the feline analogue (FIV) eVect cell entry via a mechanism that involves a surface glycoprotein (Pancino et al. 1995; Serres 2000; Frey et al. 2001 ). These glycoproteins, named gp41 and gp36, respectively, exhibit a common structural architecture consisting of a transmembrane (TM) region and membrane-proximal segment (pre-TM) that is directly involved in the virus-target cell fusion. Furthermore, both proteins present an unusual clustering of tryptophan residues in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the ectodomain of the TM region (Giannecchini et al. 2004; Suarez et al. 2000; Salzwedel et al. 1999) . The presence of the MPER domain has been shown to be crucial, through a still unidentiWed mechanism, in the infection pathway (Barbato et al. 2003) ."
Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations of Preparedness Strategies and Interventions against Influenza Pandemics,"Background: Although public health guidelines have implications for resource allocation, these issues were not explicitly considered in previous WHO pandemic preparedness and response guidance. In order to ensure a thorough and informed revision of this guidance following the H1N1 2009 pandemic, a systematic review of published and unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics was conducted.","When a new subtype of influenza A virus which is infectious to humans gains human-to-human transmissibility efficiently enough to cause community level outbreaks, this virus is said to have pandemic potential. If this new subtype spreads globally causing disease and deaths, it becomes pandemic. Since the 16th century, influenza pandemics have occurred at intervals ranging between 10-50 years, creating varying levels of impact on societies. [1] In March 2009, a new subtype of influenza A H1N1 virus was identified in Mexico and the United States. It spread to all continents in less than nine weeks becoming the first pandemic of the 21st century. Children, young adults, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses were disproportionately affected and constituted the majority of the hospitalization cases. The estimated case fatality rate was 0.15-0.25%, with most deaths in middleaged adults with underlying diseases. [2] Although concrete evidence on the macroeconomic consequences of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have not yet been revealed, previous studies estimated the potential reduction of labor productivity and consumption demand, with results showing an approximately 2-5% decrease in annual gross product. [3, 4] The World Health Organization (WHO) published pandemic preparedness and response guidance in 1999 with two revisions: the first in 2005 and the second in 2009. [1, 2] These documents summarize the recommended WHO and national actions against pandemic influenza according to recognized pandemic phases. For some recommendations, evidence is limited to observations or epidemiological models. In some cases, inferences are drawn from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome. With a view to incorporating important experience and evidence acquired during the H1N1 2009 pandemic, the WHO will revise its pandemic preparedness guidelines. Including cost effectiveness evidence in the revision process will strengthen the guidance by providing a framework to prioritize the allocation of limited resources in impending, high risk times."
Poly(amidoamine) Dendrimer Nanocarriers and Their Aerosol Formulations for siRNA Delivery to the Lung Epithelium,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapies have great promise in the treatment of a number of prevalent pulmonary disorders including lung cancer, asthma and cystic fibrosis. However, progress in this area has been hindered due to the lack of carriers that can efficiently deliver siRNA to lung epithelial cells, and also due to challenges in developing oral inhalation (OI) formulations for the regional administration of siRNA and their carriers to the lungs. In this work we report the ability of generation four, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (G4NH2)− siRNA complexes (dendriplexes) to silence the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene on A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells stably expressing eGFP. We also report the formulation of the dendriplexes and their aerosol characteristics in propellant-based portable OI devices. The size and gene silencing ability of the dendriplexes was seen not to be a strong function of the N/P ratio. Silencing efficiencies of up to 40% are reported. Stable dispersions of the dendriplexes encapsulated in mannitol and also in a biodegradable and water-soluble co-oligomer were prepared in hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based pressurized metereddose inhalers (pMDIs). Their aerosol characteristics were very favorable, and conducive to deep lung deposition, with respirable fractions of up to 77%. Importantly, siRNA formulated as dendriplexes in pMDIs was shown to keep its integrity after the particle preparation processes, and also after long-term exposures to HFA. The relevance of this study stems from the fact that this is the first work to report the formulation of inhalable siRNA with aerosol properties suitable to deep lung deposition using pMDIs devices that are the least expensive and most widely used portable inhalers. This study is relevant because, also for the first time, it shows that siRNA−G4NH2 dendriplexes can efficiently target lung alveolar epithelial A549 cells and silence genes even after siRNA has been exposed to the propellant environment.","RNA interference (RNAi) promotes silencing of gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner. 1, 2 The delivery of exogenous double-stranded small interfering RNA (ds-siRNA, typically consisting of 20−27 base pairs), 3 which targets the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) located in the cell cytoplasm, is considered a very promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of a broad range of diseases. 4, 5 RNAi-based therapies have also shown great potential in the treatment of pulmonary disorders including lung cancer, 6 cystic fibrosis, 7 asthma, 8 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 8 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 9 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viral infection. 10 However, further progress on siRNA-based technologies that target lung ailments has been hindered by the lack of adequate carriers capable of overcoming the extra and intracellular barriers present in the lung tissue, and challenges in formulating siRNA and their carriers in portable oral inhalation (OI) devices for the local delivery of siRNA to the lungs. 4, 11, 12 Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are highly monodispersed, hyperbranched polymers that contain easily functionalizable surface groups, and thus represent promising structures for the construction of effective drug carriers and gene transfer vehicles. 13, 14 Amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers have their surface groups (primary amines) protonated at physiological conditions. 15 They can thus efficiently bind to nucleic acids, forming nanoscale complexes termed dendriplexes 16 that may offer opportunities to improve targeting of siRNA to the cell cytosol. Even though many publications have addressed the transfection of cells using dendrimer−DNA complexes, 17 few reports have discussed the gene silencing (with siRNA 3, 18 or antisense oligonucleotide 19 ) with PAMAM dendrimers in cells that are models of the lung alveolar epithelium."
Rhinovirus C and Respiratory Exacerbations in Children with Cystic Fibrosis,"To investigate a possible role for human rhinovirus C in respiratory exacerbations of children with cystic fi brosis, we conducted microbiologic testing on respiratory specimens from 103 such patients in São Paulo, Brazil, during 2006 -2007 .

A Gene Encoding Sialic-Acid-Specific 9-O-Acetylesterase Found in Human Adult Testis,"Using differential display RT-PCR, we identified a gene of 2750 bp from human adult testis, named H-Lse, which encoded a putative protein of 523 amino acids and molecular weight of 58 kd with structural characteristics similar to that of mouse lysosome sialicacid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. Northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues with high expression in the testis, prostate, and colon. In situ hybridization results showed that while H-Lse was not detected in embryonic testis, positive signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in adult testis of human. The subcellular localization of H-Lse was visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the amino terminus of H-Lse, showing compartmentalization of H-Lse in large dense-core vesicles, presumably lysosomes, in the cytoplasm. The developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific expression of H-Lse suggests its possible involvement in the development of the testis and/or differentiation of germ cells.","Sialic acids are a diverse family of acidic nine-carbon sugars that are frequently found as terminal units of oligosaccharide chains on different glycoconjugates in higher invertebrates and vertebrates [1, 2] . As a part of determinants in many glycoproteins [3, 4] , sialic acids play an important role in intercellular and/or intermolecular recognition [5] . The 9-O-acetylation and de-Oacetylation are the most common modifications of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates, which can alter its size, hydrophobicity, net charge, and antigenicity [2, 6, 7] . These modifications can regulate a variety of biological phenomena, including endogenous lectin recognition, tumor antigenicity, virus binding, and complement activation [8, 9] ."
"Respiratory viral infections in institutions from late stage of the first and second waves of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009, Ontario, Canada","We report the impact of respiratory viruses on various outbreak settings by using surveillance data from the late first and second wave periods of the 2009 pandemic.

For the purpose of this study, we considered the period from April 20 to August 31, 2009, as wave I and the period from September 1 to November 30, 2009, as wave II, although wave II activity continued until January 2010. 4 "
Medical Students and Pandemic Infl uenza,"To assess knowledge of pandemic infl uenza, we administered a questionnaire to all medical students at the University of Alberta; 354 (69%) of 510 students responded. Data from questionnaires such as this could help determine the role of medical students during a public health emergency.","S cientists believe we may be on the verge of the next great pandemic. Health Canada predicts that 4.5-10.6 million Canadians will become clinically ill and 11,000-58,000 will die in such an event (1) . The current strain of infl uenza A (H5N1), which has been circulating in Southeast Asia among birds, with limited spread to humans, has fueled this concern (2,3). An infl uenza pandemic would cause a shortage of healthcare professionals due to illness and an increased demand for their services (1) . Consequently, Canada and other countries have begun developing plans to deal with the anticipated health crisis (1) , and medical students could play an important role."
,"Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the northeastern portion of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Bovine TB in deer and cattle has created immense fi nancial consequences for the livestock industry and hunting public. Surveillance identifi ed coyotes (Canis latrans) as potential bio-accumulators of Mycobacterium bovis, a fi nding that generated interest in their potential to serve as sentinels for monitoring disease risk. We sampled 175 coyotes in the bovine TB-endemic area. Fifty-eight tested positive, and infection prevalence by county ranged from 19% to 52% (statistical mean 33%, SE 0.07). By contrast, prevalence in deer (n = 3,817) was lower (i.e., 1.49%; Mann-Whitney U 4,4 = 14, p<0.001). By focusing on coyotes rather than deer, we sampled 97% fewer individuals and increased the likelihood of detecting M. bovis by 40%. As a result of reduced sampling intensity, sentinel coyote surveys have the potential to be practical indicators of M. bovis presence in wildlife and livestock.","T he emergence and reemergence of zoonotic diseases are becoming increasingly important issues for numerous reasons, including deforestation and habitat fragmentation, increased globalization of travel and trade, urbanization, and bioterrorism concerns. Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infl uenza, transmis-sible spongiform encephalopathies, Rift Valley fever, West Nile disease, anthrax, and Escherichia coli O157 infections recently have resulted in major public health and economic concerns, as well as public anxiety. Over 60% of the 1,415 known human pathogens and 75% of the 175 emerging pathogens are zoonotic (1) . Many emerging diseases have spilled over from wildlife directly (e.g., West Nile virus infection, hantavirus infection, and Lyme disease) or indirectly through domestic or peridomestic species (e.g., avian infl uenza, SARS, and Nipah virus infections, plague) (2) . Early detection of new disease outbreaks in domestic and wild animals is an essential prerequisite of disease control and eradication. Development of methods for early detection of diseases in free-ranging wildlife is problematic."
Increased Host Species Diversity and Decreased Prevalence of Sin Nombre Virus Notice to Readers and Contributing Authors,"Emerging outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are affecting humans at an alarming rate. Until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood, disease emergence will continue. For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release. The results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence.","D uring the past 60 years, the number of emerging pathogens affecting humans has substantially increased (1) . Of these emerging infectious diseases, 62% are zoonotic (2) , meaning they are naturally hosted by, and persist in, wildlife but also affect human populations. The ecological factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence are likely complex and are poorly understood. Most often, because of limited time, resources, and the exigencies of the situation, outbreak investigations of emerging diseases seek only to discover the pathogen responsible for the disease in humans. But ecological studies are of critical importance to long-term containment of zoonotic disease emergence; they are the only way to ascertain the wildlife source of the disease, the dynamics of the host-pathogen relationship, and the ecological factors associated with an outbreak. Knowledge of all these factors is needed to proactively protect the public from zoonotic diseases; without this knowledge, new diseases will continue to emerge. The worldwide distribution of these largely zoonotic diseases suggests a globally distributed mechanism for their emergence."
Access to,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the highly contagious diseases of domestic animals. Effective control of this disease needs sensitive, specific, and quick diagnostic tools at each tier of control strategy. In this paper we have outlined various diagnostic approaches from old to new generation in a nutshell. Presently FMD diagnosis is being carried out using techniques such as Virus Isolation (VI), Sandwich-ELISA (S-ELISA), Liquid-Phase Blocking ELISA (LPBE), Multiplex-PCR (m-PCR), and indirect ELISA (DIVA), and real time-PCR can be used for detection of antibody against nonstructural proteins. Nucleotide sequencing for serotyping, microarray as well as recombinant antigen-based detection, biosensor, phage display, and nucleic-acid-based diagnostic are on the way for rapid and specific detection of FMDV. Various pen side tests, namely, lateral flow, RT-LAMP, Immunostrip tests, and so forth. are also developed for detection of the virus in field condition.","Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease affecting artiodactylae, mostly cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and many species of wild ungulates [1] . FMD affects extensive areas worldwide and is included in the list of diseases notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (http://www.oie.int/eng/en index.htm). It is recognized as a significant epidemic disease threatening the cattle industry since the sixteenth century and till date it is a major global animal health problem. The history of FMD may be traced to era of Hieronymus Fracastorius, a monk who described a disease outbreak in 1546 A.D. that occurred in cattle near Verona, Italy [2] . Almost 400 years later, in 1897, Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch demonstrated that a filterable agent is responsible for FMD [3] . This was the first demonstration that a disease of animal was caused by a filterable agent and ushered in the era of virology."
Evaluation of the Antiviral Potential of Halogenated Dihydrorugosaflavonoids and Molecular Modeling with nsP3 Protein of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV),"Antiviral therapy is crucial for the circumvention of viral epidemics. The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a−f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol −1 , respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a−f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be <100 μM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.","The cases of chikungunya viral fever are burgeoning every year. Infections are not only limited to Asia and Africa; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported from Central and South America. 1, 2 Concerning the data obtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April 2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and 966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there is considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which escalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of chikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and various parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from ""Makonde"", meaning ""to become twisted"". It denotes the ""curved"" appearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans, the symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain, vomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia."
"SARS Risk Perceptions in Healthcare Workers, Japan","In coping with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infection control measures are a key aspect of protecting healthcare workers. We conducted a survey concerning perception of risk and countermeasures for SARS in 7 tertiary hospitals in Japan from July through September 2003, immediately after the SARS epidemic in neighboring countries. Based on 7,282 respondents out of 9,978 questionnaires administered, we found the perception of risk to be relatively high and the perception of countermeasures at the institutional level to be relatively low. Knowledge of preventive measures, concept of (opinions regarding) institutional measures, and perception of risk differed substantially among the 3 job categories, notably between physicians and nurses. The concept of institutional measures was the most important predictor of individual perception of risk. In view of the potential for future epidemics, planning and implementing institutional measures should be given a high priority.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in 30 countries with a total of 8,096 probable cases and 774 deaths as of July 31, 2003. A large proportion of these SARS outbreaks occurred in hospitals, and 21% of probable SARS cases involved healthcare workers (1) . Protecting healthcare workers is essential from the standpoints of both public and occupational health. Experience in hospitals has suggested that appropriate infection control measures, including use of personal protective equipment, personal hygiene, and environmental measures, such as area isolation, protect healthcare workers from SARS (2, 3) . During the SARS epidemic, hospitals in affected areas emphasized training and issued guidelines on infection control and use of personal protec-tive equipment (4) (5) (6) . To prepare for future potential outbreaks of SARS and other emerging infectious diseases, implementing appropriate infection control measures in healthcare settings and assessing the efficacy of those measures in the postepidemic period are necessary."
Correcting errors in synthetic DNA through consensus shuffling,"Although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes, these suffer from the presence of 1-3 random errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population. The DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full-length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population. We show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv ) clones from $60 to .90% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5to 4.3-fold to final values of $1 error per 3500 bp. In addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of GFPuv clones where all members were non-functional, to a population where 82% of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long DNA sequences.","Methods for the automated chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides (1, 2) and their assembly into long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences by PCR (3, 4) and LCR (5) have enabled the chemical synthesis of genes and even entire viral genomes (6, 7) . These technological advances have helped spur the formation of the new field of synthetic biology (8) , which aims at defining the functional units of living organisms through the modular engineering of synthetic organisms. In addition, the demand for fully synthetic gene length DNA fragments of defined sequence has dramatically increased in recent years for use in applications such as codon optimization (9), construction of DNA vaccines (10) , de novo synthesis of novel biopolymers (11) , or simply to gain access to known DNA sequences when original templates are unavailable. The future demand for long synthetic DNA is likely to dramatically increase when it becomes cheaper/faster to synthesize a desired sequence than to obtain it by other means."
SARS coronavirus papain-like protease inhibits the type I interferon signaling pathway through interaction with the STING-TRAF3- TBK1 complex,"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) develops an antagonistic mechanism by which to evade the antiviral activities of interferon (IFN). Previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway, which would normally elicit a robust IFN response, but the mechanism(s) used by SARS PLpro to inhibit activation of the IRF3 pathway is not fully known. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how SARS PLpro efficiently inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway. We found that expression of the membrane-anchored PLpro domain (PLpro-TM) from SARS-CoV inhibits STING/ TBK1/IKKε-mediated activation of type I IFNs and disrupts the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, which are activated by STING and TBK1. Meanwhile, we showed that PLpro-TM physically interacts with TRAF3, TBK1, IKKε, STING, and IRF3, the key components that assemble the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex for activation of IFN expression. However, the interaction between the components in STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex is disrupted by PLpro-TM. Furthermore, SARS PLpro-TM reduces the levels of ubiquitinated forms of RIG-I, STING, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 in the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex. These results collectively point to a new mechanism used by SARS-CoV through which PLpro negatively regulates IRF3 activation by interaction with STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex, yielding a SARS-CoV countermeasure against host innate immunity.","The innate immune system represents the first line of defense and initiates counteractive responses that protect the host from viral infection through evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (Kawai and Akira, 2007) . PRRs include the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic sensors, such as retinoic acidinducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which sense RNA viruses (Kawai and Akira, 2007) . RIG-I specifically detects the intracellular double-stranded viral RNA bearing 5′ triphosphate and panhandle structures to activate antiviral signaling (Hornung et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006) . Once a host is invaded by a virus, PRRs transmit signals to the downstream kinases that activate transcription factors, including IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and ATF-2/c-jun, with the help of different adaptor molecules (MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/Cardif for RIG-I, TRIF for TLR3, and MyD88 for TLR7/8/9) to activate IFN production (Barral et al., 2009; Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009; Chen and Jiang, 2013) ."
,"a patient from United Arab Emirates who had severe respiratory infection was transferred to a hospital in Germany, 11 days after symptom onset. Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was suspected on March 21 and confirmed on March 23; the patient, who had contact with an ill camel shortly before symptom onset, died on March 26. A contact investigation was initiated to identify possible person-to-person transmission and assess infection control measures. Of 83 identified contacts, 81 were available for follow-up. Ten contacts experienced mild symptoms, but test results for respiratory and serum samples were negative for MERS-CoV. Serologic testing was done for 53 (75%) of 71 nonsymptomatic contacts; all results were negative. Among contacts, the use of FFP2/FFP3 face masks during aerosol exposure was more frequent after MERS-CoV infection was suspected than before. Infection control measures may have prevented nosocomial transmission of the virus.",76% also had >1 underlying chronic condition (4). The median age of case-patients was 50 years (range 14 months to 94 years). All cases were directly or indirectly related to countries in the Middle East or on the Arabian Peninsula.
Pro/con clinical debate: Steroids are a key component in the treatment of SARS,"105 ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; ICU = intensive care unit; IL = interleukin; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome. Available online http://ccforum.com/content/8/2/105 Unfortunately, in the winter of 2004 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerges in the world once again, and health care workers in your institution begin to develop the illness. Patients with SARS start to develop critical illness and you are asked to become involved in their care. You have read that during the first outbreak of SARS steroids were a commonly employed therapy. Despite this you worry about the adverse effects of steroid therapy, especially in critically ill patients.","SARS is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by infection with SARS coronavirus. The early phase of the disease appears to be due to the virus itself whereas the later phase is thought to be due to an inflammatory response. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirates has shown that the viral load peaks at about 10 days from symptom onset [1] , and serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-16 and tumour necrosis factor-α are most markedly raised 8-14 days from disease onset [2] . In addition, the histological changes in the lungs of patients who died from SARS suggest cytokine dysregulation [3] . Thus, the available data suggest that the clinical manifestations of SARS in the second week of illness are predominantly due to an excessive immune response to viral infection rather than to infection itself. Because admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) occurs 8-9 days after symptom onset and the median duration of ICU stay is 8.5-14.5 days [4] [5] [6] , it is likely that most critically ill patients are in this immunological phase. Therefore, a logical approach is to modify the immune response with antiinflammatory agents such as corticosteroids."
A new unconventional HLA-A2-restricted epitope from HBV core protein elicits antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes,"However, most of identified CTL epitopes are derived from HBV of genotypes A and D, and few have been defined in virus of genotypes B and C which are more prevalent in Asia. As HBV core protein (HBc) is the most conservative and immunogenic component, in this study we used an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool covering HBc to screen and identify specific CTL epitopes. An unconventional HLA-A2-restricted epitope HBc141-149 was discovered and structurally characterized by crystallization analysis. The immunogenicity and anti-HBV activity were further determined in HBV and HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Finally, we show that mutations in HBc141-149 epitope are associated with viral parameters and disease progression in HBV infected patients. Our data therefore provide insights into the structure characteristics of this unconventional epitope binding to MHC-I molecules, as well as epitope specific CTL activity that orchestrate T cell response and immune evasion in HBV infected patients.","Around 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Chronic HBV infection is a major cause of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Lavanchy, 2005; Neuveut et al., 2010) . HBV-specific CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTL)-mediated immune response is multi-specific, polyclonal, and vigorous during acute hepatitis B (AHB), which plays a vital role in viral control and viral clearance, as well as disease pathogenesis (Yukihiro, 2012; Westover and Hughes, 2007; Tan et al., 2008) .

"Antibody-Mediated ""Universal"" Osteoclast Targeting Platform using Calcitonin as a Model Drug","Purpose To generate and characterize a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and to develop an antiresorptive strategy using this mAb as an osteoclast-targeting platform that selectively targets osteoclast cells whilst delivering an attached (i.e. chemically conjugated) active drug cargo. Methods Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL. To test the efficacy of the conjugate in vitro, osteoclasts were generated from precursor RAW 264.7 cells by dosing with the cytokines macrophagecolony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and RANK Ligand (RANKL) and TRAP activity assay, Resorption Pit Assay, TRAP staining were performed. Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by in vitro intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells.","Osteoclasts are the cells uniquely responsible for dissolving both the organic and inorganic components of bone during development and are part of the bone remodeling cycle throughout life. These cells originate from hematopoietic precursors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage that are present both in the bone marrow and peripheral circulation, and their numbers and/or activity are frequently increased in a wide range of clinical disorders that are associated with excessive bone loss and which affect millions of people (1) ."
Has the Virus of Multiple Sclerosis Been Isolated?,"There have been many attempts to isolate infectious agents from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and many viruses have been incriminated at one time or another over the past few decades. However, in every case further research has disproved the original claim. Thus, we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of three patients with MS and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The patients yielding the isolates from their CSF possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood, in contrast to several other virus-free patients with chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases studied at the same time. The virus could not be isolated from 27 patients who were not suffering from chronic disease of the CNS. The agent has not yet been adequately Address reprint requests to: Dr.","characterized, but it deserves further attention because it seems to be a hitherto unknown virus, difficult to isolate and difficult to work with in the laboratory. Its isolation from the four patients mentioned above (and subsequently in several other MS patients) warrants further investigation of its potential role in MS and other progressive diseases of the CNS."
Applying a Linear Amplification Strategy to Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Uniform DNA Library Amplification,"Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification method with broad applications as a point-of-care test and in molecular biology techniques. Currently, most of the applications are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted. Thus, to amplify the sizevariable DNA library uniformly, we introduced a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library, we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of different DNA molecules.","Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) was first reported in 2006 and has rapidly become an alternative method to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various applications. 1 Typically, RPA requires a recombinase, singlestranded DNA-binding protein and a polymerase 1 to amplify nucleic acids. The mechanism of RPA is similar to that of PCR. First, the recombinase and primer form a complex and attach to the target site. Then, the polymerase recognizes the primer and extends through the template DNA. During extension, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins attach to the opposite strand to stabilize the RPA reaction intermediate. RPA has two advantages over PCRreaction temperature and reaction time. RPA usually proceeds between 37 and 42°C under isothermal conditions, which is advantageous for instrument-free field diagnosis and prevention of heat-induced DNA mutations. The reaction time for RPA is typically 15 2 or 20−40 min based on the manufacturer's protocol, which is shorter than most PCR reactions. Because of these advantages, RPA is used for detection and diagnosis of specific bacteria 2−4 and viruses. 5−8 Moreover, RPA can be conducted on solidphase materials, 9−11 including lateral flow dipstick, 10,12−14 which permits the technique to be used in point-of-care tests."
Public Response to Community Mitigation Measures for Pandemic Infl uenza,"We report the results of a national survey conducted to help public health offi cials understand the public's response to community mitigation interventions for a severe outbreak of pandemic infl uenza. Survey results suggest that if community mitigation measures are instituted, most respondents would comply with recommendations but would be challenged to do so if their income or job were severely compromised. The results also indicate that community mitigation measures could cause problems for persons with lower incomes and for racial and ethnic minorities. Twentyfour percent of respondents said that they would not have anyone available to take care of them if they became sick with pandemic infl uenza. Given these results, planning and public engagement will be needed to encourage the public to be prepared.","S cientists and policymakers are concerned about the emergence of an infl uenza pandemic for which we will have neither a strain-specifi c vaccine nor suffi cient antiviral medications at the onset of the outbreak. In February 2007, the Community Strategy for Pandemic Infl uenza Mitigation was issued; it describes the early, targeted, and layered use of nonpharmaceutical interventions, coupled with specifi c uses of antiviral infl uenza medications, to reduce transmission of pandemic infl uenza and mitigate the disease (1) ."
Common and unique features of viral RNA-dependent polymerases,"Eukaryotes and bacteria can be infected with a wide variety of RNA viruses. On average, these pathogens share little sequence similarity and use different replication and transcription strategies. Nevertheless, the members of nearly all RNA virus families depend on the activity of a virally encoded RNA-dependent polymerase for the condensation of nucleotide triphosphates. This review provides an overview of our current understanding of the viral RNAdependent polymerase structure and the biochemistry and biophysics that is involved in replicating and transcribing the genetic material of RNA viruses.","Infections with RNA viruses place a constant burden on our healthcare systems and economy [1, 2] . Over the past century, this has been particularly true for infections with the Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Influenza A virus (IAV), Rotavirus (RotaV), West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus (DV), Measles virus (MV), and the Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . But also emergent RNA viruses can have considerable consequences, such as the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [7] and, more recently, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8] and the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) [9] . One way to limit the impact of RNA viruses and retroviruses is to prevent their replication, and a thorough understanding of the replication and transcription of these pathogens is, therefore, essential."
Attempted early detection of influenza A (H1N1) pandemic with surveillance data of influenza-like illness and unexplained pneumonia,"Background To collect disease information and provide data for early detection of epidemics, two surveillance systems were established for influenza-like illness (ILI) and unexplained pneumonia (UP) in Wuxi, People's Republic of China.","Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a severe infectious disease accounting for between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths worldwide every year. Millions of people died in the influenza pandemic of 1918, one of the worst epidemic disasters in recorded human history. 1 The life style of modern society, including overcrowded cities and rapid global transportation, has resulted in dissemination of influenza and generation of novel virus strains. In the past year, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a level-6 alert for the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the highest level of disease outbreak, because of the sustained spread of this new virus on a global scale. 2 The world was fortunate not to have experienced another devastating influenza epidemic, because the fatality rate of the new virus strain was similar to seasonal influenza virus. 3 However, there remains an inevitability of a new influenza pandemic, which could be highly infectious and as deadly as the 1918 influenza pandemic. Thus, it is necessary, although challenging to detect the onset of a new influenza epidemic, to allow the government to make timely and proper interventions to reduce the social and economic impact from influenza epidemics. The influenza surveillance system long has been playing an essential role in collecting disease information and providing evidence for prevention and control strategies and measures. Two surveillance systems were established in Wuxi for influenza-like illness (ILI) and unexplained pneumonia (UP) after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The ILI system was implemented for influenza surveillance, and the UP system was designed to track lower respiratory illness with pneumonia symptoms. Although the disease surveillance systems appeared decades later than in developed countries, their performance is by no means inferior to define the distribution of circulating strains in the community and detect disease aberration. Here we described and compared the accumulated ILI data from 2004 to 2009 and UP data from 2007 to 2009. To further evaluate the effectiveness of these surveillance systems in early warning of influenza epidemics, we monitored ILI data between 2004 and 2008 by both a control chart method and the Serfling method and tested goodness of fit using influenza A (H1N1) data of 2009."
Rapid identification of novel antigens of Salmonella Enteritidis by microarray-based immunoscreening,"We report on an approach to rapidly screen thousands of Salmonella Enteritidis proteins with the goal of identifying novel immunodominant proteins. We used a microarray-based system that warrants high throughput and easy handling. Seven immunogenic candidates were selected after screening. Comparative analyses by ELISA and microarrays manifested their immunodominant character. The large repetitive protein (SEN4030) that plays a role as a putative adhesin in initial cell surface interaction and is highly specific to Salmonella is considered to be the most suitable protein for a diagnostic approach. The results further demonstrate that the strategy applied herein is convenient for specifically identifying immunogenic proteins of pathogenic microorganisms. Consequently, it enables a sound assessment of promising candidates for diagnostic applications and vaccine development. Moreover, the elucidation of immunogenic proteins may assist in unveiling unknown virulence-associated factors, thus furthering the understanding of the underlying pathogenicity of Salmonella in general, and of S. Enteritidis, one of the most frequently detected serovars of this pathogen, in particular.","Salmonella are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe, motile and rod-shaped bacteria comprised of three species, S. enterica, S. bongori and S. subterranean. However, many different serovars have been described for S. enterica including the major contributors to salmonella infections in humans, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium, S. Paratyphi, and S. Choleraesuis. While S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi cause typhoid fever, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium lead to gastrointestinal infections termed salmonellosis [1] . In the European Union alone, approximately 100.000 human cases of salmonellosis are reported annually, with S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium the most frequently detected serotypes (EFSA, 2013). These non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) cause a localized infection manifesting as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The infection dose is approximately 10 5 bacteria and the disease is mainly self-limiting with mild symptoms [2] . However, in immunocompromised people and young children the severity of the disease may be more pronounced including typhoid-like infections potentially leading to systemic infections and sepsis [3] . While several in vivo animal infection models have been used to study the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium [4] [5] [6] , S. Enteritidis has been insufficiently studied. Additionally, evidence suggests that S. Enteritidis requires genes missing in S. Typhimurium [7] ."
Community Epidemiology Framework for Classifying Disease Threats Framework for Classifying Disease Threats Emerging Infectious Diseases • www International Symposium on Emerging Zoonoses Medical and Veterinary Partnerships To Address Global Challenges,"Recent evidence suggests that most parasites can infect multiple host species and that these are primarily responsible for emerging infectious disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife. However, the ecologic and evolutionary factors that constrain or facilitate such emergences are poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework based on the pathogen's between-and within-species transmission rates to describe possible configurations of a multihost-pathogen community that may lead to disease emergence. We establish 3 dynamic thresholds separating 4 classes of disease outcomes, spillover, apparent multihost, true multihost, and potential emerging infectious disease; describe possible disease emergence scenarios; outline the population dynamics of each case; and clarify existing terminology. We highlight the utility of this framework with examples of disease threats in human and wildlife populations, showing how it allows us to understand which ecologic factors affect disease emergence and predict the impact of host shifts in a range of disease systems.","M odels of host-pathogen dynamics have typically assumed a single-host population infected by a single pathogen. However, most pathogens can infect several host species; >60% of human pathogens, >68% of wild primate parasites, and >90% of domesticated animal pathogens infect multiple host species (1) (2) (3) . An interest in multihost pathogens is particularly timely, given that many of the most threatening current pathogens (e.g., HIV, West Nile virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus) are believed to have crossed species barriers to infect humans, domesticated animals, or wildlife populations (1, (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, we do not know the host and pathogen characteristics that determine such host shifts and the likely characteristics of future emerging infectious diseases. To address this issue, 2 theoretical approaches have been adopted. The first, using dynamic models, focuses on the host's perspective and ascertains how a shared pathogen affects the dynamics of 2 host populations (9) (10) (11) (12) . The second approach takes the pathogen's point of view and considers how combined host densities affect pathogen persistence within the community (13) (14) (15) . However, as the number of studies grows, so does the terminology. Terms such as multihost pathogens, dead-end hosts, reservoir hosts, host shifts, and spillovers are frequently used, but often different phrases are used to describe the same phenomenon, and possibly more concerning, the same terminology may be used to describe strictly different phenomena."
MicroRNA-based strategy to mitigate the risk of gain-of-function influenza studies HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Recent gain-of-function studies in influenza A virus H5N1 strains revealed that as few as three amino-acid changes in the hemagglutinin protein confer the capacity for viral transmission between ferrets 1, 2 . As transmission between ferrets is considered a surrogate indicator of transmissibility between humans, these studies raised concerns about the risks of gain-of-function influenza A virus research. Here we present an approach to strengthen the biosafety of gain-offunction influenza experiments. We exploit species-specific endogenous small RNAs to restrict influenza A virus tropism. In particular, we found that the microRNA miR-192 was expressed in primary human respiratory tract epithelial cells as well as mouse lungs but absent from the ferret respiratory tract. Incorporation of miR-192 target sites into influenza A virus did not prevent influenza replication and transmissibility in ferrets, but did attenuate influenza pathogenicity in mice. This molecular biocontainment approach should be applicable beyond influenza A virus to minimize the risk of experiments involving other pathogenic viruses.","The seasonal pathogen influenza A virus has the potential to cause catastrophic pandemics. Owing to the segmented nature and replication dynamics of its RNA genome, influenza A virus can undergo gene reassortment and/or accumulate mutations that permit its persistence and evolution in nature as well as its adaptation to new hosts 3 . For example, influenza A virus circulates in birds as a pathogen of the digestive and respiratory tracts but, on occasion, gains the capacity to jump species and establish respiratory infections in mammals 3 . Although many strains of IAV circulate in migratory bird species at any particular time, the H5N1 strain has caused several hundred human deaths since 1997, and public health authorities are concerned that it may evolve to become as deadly as the 1918 H1N1 4 . The recent emergence of H7N9 infections in humans in China is causing similar concerns 5 ."
,"To understand different aspects of community responses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 population-based, random telephone surveys were conducted in June 2003 and January 2004 in Hong Kong. More than 70% of respondents would avoid visiting hospitals or mainland China to avoid contracting SARS. Most respondents believed that SARS could be transmitted through droplets, fomites, sewage, and animals. More than 90% believed that public health measures were efficacious means of prevention; 40.4% believed that SARS would resurge in Hong Kong; and ≈70% would then wear masks in public places. High percentages of respondents felt helpless, horrified, and apprehensive because of SARS. Approximately 16% showed signs of posttraumatic symptoms, and ≈40% perceived increased stress in family or work settings. The general public in Hong Kong has been very vigilant about SARS but needs to be more psychologically prepared to face a resurgence of the epidemic.","T he severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected ≈30 countries, resulting in 8,422 cases and 916 deaths globally (1) . Approximately 20.8% (1,755) of the cases and 32.8% (300) of the deaths occurred in Hong Kong. The World Health Organization issued a travel advisory warning against visiting Hong Kong from April 2 to May 23, 2003 (2) . School classes were suspended from March to May 2003 (3) . More than 90% of Hong Kong residents frequently wore face masks in public places from March through May 2003, and 33.6% worried that they or their family members would contract the disease (4) . A number of hypotheses have been generated about different modes of transmission of SARS (5) (6) (7) . However, responses to many of these issues have not yet been formulated. From December 16, 2003, through April 30, 2004 , another 14 new SARS cases were reported in 4 areas in China (8) (9) (10) . Public health measures played an important role in the control of the spread of SARS in the community (11, 12) . Whether SARS will reappear in some parts of the world is not known."

Predictors of symptoms of posttraumatic stress in Chinese university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic,"The university environment poses a high risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, as it is a mass gathering place for youth. This study aimed to evaluate the predictors of stress symptoms among Chinese university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.","The novel H1N1 Influenza outbreak in April 2009 was unprecedented in several respects including the new virus, the season of origin (spring, not late fall), and the cohort at risk for infection and death (children and young adults, not infants and the elderly) [1] [2] [3] [4] . The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus is currently the dominant influenza strain in most parts of the world [5] [6] [7] [8] .

Relationship of SARS-CoV to other pathogenic RNA viruses explored by tetranucleotide usage profiling,"The exact origin of the cause of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is still an open question. The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a newly identified infectious disease, has imperilled the health of human population in more than 30 nations. It has claimed over 812 lives and infected more than 8442 (9.61% death rate) by July 2, 2003 [1] since its outbreak in November 2002 in the province of GuangDong, People's Republic of China. By May 15, 2003 , the primary etiological agent for SARS was found to fulfil Koch's postulate through experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) [2] .

Short Report: A Prospective Evaluation of Real-Time PCR Assays for the Detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. for Early Diagnosis of Rickettsial Infections during the Acute Phase of Undifferentiated Febrile Illness,"One hundred and eighty febrile patients were analyzed in a prospective evaluation of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for early diagnosis of rickettsial infections. By paired serology, 3.9% (7 of 180) and 6.1% (11 of 180) of patients were confirmed to have acute scrub or murine typhus, respectively. The PCR assays for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. had high specificity (99.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.8-100] and 100% [95% CI: 97.8-100], respectively). The PCR results were also compared with immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on acute sera. For O. tsutsugamushi, PCR sensitivity was twice that of acute specimen IgM IFA (28.6% versus 14.3%; McNemar's P = 0.3). For Rickettsia spp., PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM IFA (36.4% versus 9.1%; P = 0.08), although this was not statistically significant. Whole blood and buffy coat, but not serum, were acceptable specimens for these PCRs. Further evaluation of these assays in a larger prospective study is warranted.","Scrub and murine typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia typhi, respectively, are important acute febrile illnesses in Thailand. 1, 2 Clinical diagnosis is difficult because early symptoms are similar to other common infections such as dengue, leptospirosis, and malaria. 3 Laboratory confirmation is also difficult, conventionally requiring either culture of the infectious agent in cell monolayers at biosafety level-3, 4 or paired serology (indirect immunofluorescence assay [IFA]) for the detection of rising antibody titers. 5 "

Molecular imaging represents a group of integrated and complementary methods that evaluate the biological information resolved in time and space in vivo, at high resolution and by using with specific probes, contrast agents or MR methods with a view not only to understand cell biology but also to provide early diagnosis and support emerging therapies. The use of imaging probes based on different tracers with advanced high-resolution equipment allows viewing complex molecular and cellular structures. Implementation and evaluation of multimodality molecular imaging technology producing multiparametric and multivariable techniques is reinforced. Recent developments in CT technology (increased number of detector rows, shorter turnaround times and radiation dose modulation) and PET technology (more efficient scintillation crystals, 3D and 4D detection technology, TOF and iterative reconstruction algorithms) have been spectacular. PET-MR produces images with excellent tissue contrast, dynamic and functional information. The simultaneous acquisition of PET and MR images allows temporary correction of dynamic PET studies. Positron-emitting radionuclides for PET images, created in a cyclotron (18 F, 11C, 15O, 64Cu, 124I, 13N) or in a generator (68Ga), will be described. In this talk, the principal radiotracers and multimodality (PET-CT and PET-MR) devices will be summarised by showing their possible contribution to the early diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis and treatment monitoring of biological processes and disease-related cell. The main indications for multimodality PET in the field of oncology, neurology and cardiology will be commented. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the multimodality approach to MI based on PET-CT-MRI. 2. To learn about the different radiotracers that can be used with multimodality equipment. 3. To be informed about future developments that may potentially be used with these techniques. 14:00 -15:30 Room B Interactive Teaching Session E³ 220 Acute abdominal inflammatory disorders A-004 14:00 A.

In parallel with this, the rapid pace of biologic advances has made this the age of molecular medicine. Thanks to the emerging field of molecular imaging, the radiology community has the opportunity to help lead a revolution in modern medicine towards optimisd diagnosis and therapy of individual patients. Molecular imaging is the in vivo characteristion and measurement of biological processes that occur at the cellular and molecular level at a macroscopic level of resolution. This is in contrast to the current conventional, anatomically based radiology. The most widely used molecular imaging modalities include optical (fluorescence, bioluminescence); radionuclide (PET, SPECT); ultrasound; and MRI (spectroscopy, diffusion-weighed imaging). The interaction of several disciplines, including molecular cell biology and chemistry, has demonstrated the advantages of multi-modality, multi-disciplinary approach to molecular imaging. There are three currently used imaging strategies to noninvasively monitor and measure molecular events. They have been broadly defined as ""direct"", ""biomarker"" and ""indirect"" imaging. Although most of these imaging techniques are in the preclinical or early clinical phases, radiology will benefit greatly from these methods in the effort to detect and diagnose these diseases, to target therapies and to monitor results at the molecular level. Molecular imaging is the key technology by which to accomplish these goals. Imaging practitioners should think of themselves primarily as biologists whose task is to image what happens functionally and structurally at the molecular level. Learning Objectives:"
DNA Vaccines: Developing New Strategies against Cancer,"Due to their rapid and widespread development, DNA vaccines have entered into a variety of human clinical trials for vaccines against various diseases including cancer. Evidence that DNA vaccines are well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile proved to be of advantage as many clinical trials combines the first phase with the second, saving both time and money. It is clear from the results obtained in clinical trials that such DNA vaccines require much improvement in antigen expression and delivery methods to make them sufficiently effective in the clinic. Similarly, it is clear that additional strategies are required to activate effective immunity against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Engineering vaccine design for manipulating antigen presentation and processing pathways is one of the most important aspects that can be easily handled in the DNA vaccine technology. Several approaches have been investigated including DNA vaccine engineering, co-delivery of immunomodulatory molecules, safe routes of administration, prime-boost regimen and strategies to break the immunosuppressive networks mechanisms adopted by malignant cells to prevent immune cell function. Combined or single strategies to enhance the efficacy and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines are applied in completed and ongoing clinical trials, where the safety and tolerability of the DNA platform are substantiated. In this review on DNA vaccines, salient aspects on this topic going from basic research to the clinic are evaluated. Some representative DNA cancer vaccine studies are also discussed.","Spontaneous tumour regression has followed bacterial, fungal, viral, and protozoal infections.

Primate-to-Human Retroviral Transmission in Asia Primate-to-Human Retroviral Transmission in Asia Emerging Infectious Diseases • www Search past issues,"We describe the first reported transmission to a human of simian foamy virus (SFV) from a free-ranging population of nonhuman primates in Asia. The transmission of an exogenous retrovirus, SFV, from macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to a human at a monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia, was investigated with molecular and serologic techniques. Antibodies to SFV were detected by Western blotting of serum from 1 of 82 humans tested. SFV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the blood of the same person. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products confirmed the virus's close phylogenetic relationship to SFV isolated from macaques at the same temple. This study raises concerns that persons who work at or live around monkey temples are at risk for infection with SFV.","R ecent epidemics such as HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have changed the way we view emerging infectious diseases; these epidemics show that animal reservoirs are important sources of new infectious threats to humans. Contact between humans and animals is a crucial rate-limiting step in this process, although data describing the variables that influence animal-tohuman transmission are relatively scarce. Nonhuman primates, by virtue of their genetic, physiologic, and sometimes social similarities to humans, are particularly likely sources of infectious agents that pose a threat to humans (1, 2) . Data on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV dramatize this point; scientists now theorize that SIVs were transmitted from primates to humans on several occasions (3, 4) . As a result, concern is increasing that other infectious agents enzootic in primate populations may endanger humans (5) ."
A cascade reaction network mimicking the basic functional steps of acquired immune response,"Biological systems use complex 'information processing cores' composed of molecular networks to coordinate their external environment and internal states. An example of this is the acquired, or adaptive, immune system (AIS), which is composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components. Here we report the step-by-step construction of a prototype mimic of the AIS which we call Adaptive Immune Response Simulator (AIRS). DNA and enzymes are used as simple artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system which responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of reactions can function in a manner which is superficially similar to the most basic responses of the vertebrate acquired immune system, including reaction sequences that mimic both humoral and cellular responses. As such, AIRS provides guidelines for the design and engineering of artificial reaction networks and molecular devices.","Introduction antibodies and immunological memory, but also cell-mediated responses, including the key steps of antigen presentation, antigen binding, co-stimulation and destruction of the foreign body (phagocytosis). More broadly, a network of specialized cells, tissues and organs work together to recognize, respond and remember specific antigens or pathogens. Functionally, each step in the sequence of humoral and cellular immune response involves the activation and deployment of B and T lymphocytes via highly complex signaling pathways. A fully implemented artificial AIS has not been well studied, possibly resulting from the difficulty of controlling programmability and transferring the high-level biological codes into simple artificial modules and physical implementations. In addition, the formation of robust molecular structures and precise control of their temporal dynamics may be other difficulties. However, in the present work, we have hypothesized the feasibility of designing a network of reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA and enzyme as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the activation and deployment of acquired immune response at its most fundamental level."
Extracting geographic locations from the literature for virus phylogeography using supervised and distant supervision methods,"The field of phylogeography allows researchers to model the spread and evolution of viral genetic sequences. Phylogeography plays a major role in infectious disease surveillance, viral epidemiology and vaccine design. When conducting viral phylogeographic studies, researchers require the location of the infected host of the virus, which is often present in public databases such as GenBank. However, the geographic metadata in most GenBank records is not precise enough for many phylogeographic studies; therefore, researchers often need to search the articles linked to the records for more information, which can be a tedious process. Here, we describe two approaches for automatically detecting geographic location mentions in articles pertaining to virus-related GenBank records: a supervised sequence labeling approach with innovative features and a distant-supervision approach with novel noisereduction methods. Evaluated on a manually annotated gold standard, our supervised sequence labeling and distant supervision approaches attained F-scores of 0.81 and 0.66, respectively.","Phylogeography, an emerging discipline in public health, allows researchers to model the evolution and migration patterns of viruses, and can be an especially useful tool for studying rapidly evolving viruses like RNA viruses [1] . Given that RNA viruses such as influenza, Ebola, and hepatitis C account for approximately a third of emerging and re-emerging infections, phylogeography is growing increasingly popular among public health researchers. It allows researchers to estimate the origin and drivers of infectious diseases, and has recently been applied to study outbreaks of Ebola [2] , avian influenza [3] , and Zika virus [4] , among others."
Ducks: The ''Trojan Horses'' of H5N1 influenza,"Wild ducks are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry and mammals, including humans. Of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of influenza A viruses, only the H5 and H7 subtypes cause highly pathogenic (HP) influenza in the natural hosts. Several duck species are naturally resistant to HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. These duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs. While the HP Asian H5N1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the ''Trojan horses'' of H5N1 in their surreptitious spread of virus. An important unresolved issue is whether the HP H5N1 viruses are maintained in the wild duck population of the world. Here, we review the ecology and pathobiology of ducks infected with influenza A viruses and ducks' role in the maintenance and spread of HP H5N1 viruses. We also identify the key questions about the role of ducks that must be resolved in order to understand the emergence and control of pandemic influenza. It is generally accepted that wild duck species can spread HP H5N1 viruses, but there is insufficient evidence to show that ducks maintain these viruses and transfer them from one generation to the next.","Avian influenza is caused by type A viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The influenza A viruses infect primarily free-living aquatic birds, and they are classified by their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins. All 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been isolated from aquatic birds; wild ducks are the main reservoir. The viruses cause asymptomatic or low pathogenic infection in these natural hosts. 1 However, certain strains of influenza A virus have crossed the host range barrier and infected other species, including humans. These viruses are the source of the influenza pandemics that emerge at irregular intervals. 1, 2 The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern because they can become highly pathogenic (HP), causing systemic illness and death in both avian and mammalian species, including humans. 2 The H5N1 virus that emerged in Asia in 1996 is unique among the HP avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in that it has continued to circulate in avian species for more than a decade and has spread to more than 60 countries in Eurasia (http://www.who.int/csr/ disease/avian_influenza/en/). While the H5N1 HPAI viruses are 100% lethal to chickens and gallinaceous poultry, they often cause asymptomatic infection in some species of domestic and wild ducks. These ''silent spreaders'' of H5N1 HPAI viruses are therefore referred to as ''Trojan horses''. [3] [4] [5] Clearly, ducks play a complex and vital role in the biology and the overall natural history of influenza, including H5N1 HPAI viruses."
Microbiological study of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) and the usefulness of analytical and clinical parameters in its identification (VIRAE study),"Purpose: Respiratory infection is the most common cause for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. Patients and methods: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. Results: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. Conclusion: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with the World Health Organization estimating its rise from being the fifth to the third leading cause of death by 2030. 1 The overall prevalence of COPD in Spain is estimated to be 10.2%. 2 COPD is a slow, progressive disease, with patients experiencing episodes of acute deterioration known as exacerbations, 3 which increase in frequency and severity with disease progression."
Coronaviridae and SARS-associated Coronavirus Strain HSR1,"During the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV). We have isolated a SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) strain by injecting Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia; the patient traveled from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003. Ultrastructural analysis of infected Vero cells showed the virions within cell vesicles and around the cell membrane. The full-length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the Hong-Kong Hotel M isolate. By using both real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay and an infectivity plaque assay, we determined that approximately 360 viral genomes were required to generate a PFU. In addition, heparin (100 mg/mL) inhibited infection of Vero cells by 50%. Overall, the molecular and biologic characteristics of the strain HSR1 provide evidence that SARS-CoV forms a fourth genetic coronavirus group with distinct genomic and biologic features.","A n outbreak of atypical pneumonia, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was identified in the Guangdong Province of People's Republic of China at the end of 2002 and spread to other Asian countries and Canada (1, 2) from February through March 2003. Individual cases (all in persons infected in Asia) were diagnosed in Europe during the same period (3) . A novel human coronavirus (SARS-associated coronavirus [SARS-CoV]) has been isolated from the oropharyngeal specimens of patients with SARS (4, 5) . Experimental infection of macaques has confirmed that the SARS-CoV is the cause of SARS (6, 7) ."
Saving Human Lives: What Complexity Science and Information Systems can Contribute,"We discuss models and data of crowd disasters, crime, terrorism, war and disease spreading to show that conventional recipes, such as deterrence strategies, are often not effective and sufficient to contain them. Many common approaches do not provide a good picture of the actual system behavior, because they neglect feedback loops, instabilities and cascade effects. The complex and often counter-intuitive behavior of social systems and their macro-level collective dynamics can be better understood by means of complexity science. We highlight that a suitable system design and management can help to stop undesirable cascade effects and to enable favorable kinds of self-organization in the system. In such a way, complexity science can help to save human lives.","number of serious issues still plaguing society despite better-than-ever science, measurement opportunities, information systems, and technology."
Prior infection of pigs with a recent human H3N2 influenza virus confers minimal cross-protection against a European swine H3N2 virus,"Background H3N2 influenza viruses circulating in humans and European pigs originate from the pandemic A/Hong Kong/68 virus. Because of slower antigenic drift in swine, the antigenic divergence between swine and human viruses has been increasing. It remains unknown to what extent this results in a reduced cross-protection between recent human and swine H3N2 influenza viruses.","The antigenic and genetic characteristics of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) vary in different continents and regions of the world, but most if not all H3N2 SIVs contain hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from early or more recent human H3N2 viruses. 1 In Europe, H3N2 SIVs are derived from descendants of the 1968 ""Hong Kong"" pandemic virus, but they have evolved further through genetic reassortment with the endemic avian-like H1N1 SIV in the mid-1980s. This has resulted in H3N2 SIVs with human-like HA and NA genes and avian-like internal genes. 2, 3 In North America, H3N2 viruses did not become established in the pig population until 1998. These viruses are ""triple"" reassortants with the HA, NA, and PB1 genes of human H3N2 viruses from the mid-1990s and the remaining genes of classical swine and avian origin. 4 Multiple H3N2 SIV lineages have been found in Asia, and all have HA and NA genes derived from human H3N2 viruses from various time periods. [5] [6] [7] Because of slower antigenic drift in the H3 HA in swine than in humans, 5, 8 human-lineage H3N2 viruses in swine over time become increasingly divergent from contemporary human H3N2 viruses. As an example, European H3N2 SIVs from 1983 to 1999 showed a six times slower rate of antigenic drift than their human counterparts. 8 Consequently, European H3N2 SIVs from recent years still show some degree of serological cross-reactivity with human viruses from the 1970s to 1980s, but not with human viruses isolated after 1990. 9, 10 Swine influenza viruses usually do not infect humans, but sporadic dead-end zoonotic infections have been reported with most SIV subtypes or lineages. [11] [12] [13] Such infections are generally mild and clinically indistinguishable from infections with human influenza viruses. Most cases of swine influenza occur in people with direct or indirect exposure to swine, frequently children, or young adults. The European H3N2 SIV has been isolated from a 1-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy in the Netherlands in 1993. 14 A closely related virus was also isolated from a 10-month-old girl in Hong Kong in 1999. 15 In North America, nine cases of human infection with triple reassortant H3N2 SIV have been reported from 2005 to 2010. 12, 16, 17 A variant of the original triple reassortant H3N2 SIVs, which contains the matrix gene of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus, has been detected in 13 humans in the United States from July 2011 to April 2012, 18 and in 306 cases in 10 US states from July to September 2012, mainly in children visiting county or state fairs. 19 The increasing numbers of human cases may be in part due to heightened awareness and surveillance. No H3N2 SIV has so far shown the capacity to spread efficiently between humans."
Detection and characterization of horizontal transfers in prokaryotes using genomic signature,"Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up $6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among $12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.","It is now widely admitted that actual genomes have a common ancestor (LUCA, Last Universal Common Ancestor). Their current diversity results from events that have modified genomes during evolution. While some of these events happen at the nucleotide level (point mutation, indel of few nucleotides), others [strand inversion, duplications, repetitions, transpositions and horizontal transfers (HTs)] may concern significant parts of the genome. It has been postulated that HTs (exchange of genetic material between two different species) were very frequent during the first stages of evolution and are essentially subsisting nowadays in prokaryotes (1) (2) (3) (4) . As a consequence, the detection of HTs appears crucial to the understanding of the evolutionary processes and to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of exchange rate between species (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) ."
Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Diarrhea: Still an Issue in the Era of Antiretroviral Therapy,"Over half of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) experience diarrhea that contributes negatively to quality of life and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Opportunistic infectious agents that cause diarrhea in patients with HIV span the array of protozoa, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. With global use of ART, the incidence of diarrhea because of opportunistic infections has decreased; however, the incidence of noninfectious diarrhea has increased. The etiology of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV is multifactorial and includes ART-associated diarrhea and gastrointestinal damage related to HIV infection (i.e., HIV enteropathy). A basic algorithm for the diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with HIV includes physical examination, a review of medical history, assessment of HIV viral load and CD4? T cell count, stool microbiologic assessment, and endoscopic evaluation, if needed. For patients with negative diagnostic results, the diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea may be considered. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of noninfectious diarrhea are primarily supportive; however, the use of many unapproved agents is based on unstudied and anecdotal information. In addition, these agents can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events (AEs), such as drug-drug interactions with ART regimens, abuse liability, and additional gastrointestinal AEs. Currently, crofelemer, an antisecretory agent, is the only therapy approved in the USA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV on ART.","Advances in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have transformed this disease into a chronic illness [1] . As a result, individuals with HIV have a longer life expectancy [2] . When HIV is treated early and aggressively, life expectancy approaches that of uninfected individuals [3, 4] . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the annual incidence of HIV has remained stable during the past 10 years [2] . In 2010, the prevalence of HIV in individuals aged over 13 years was estimated to be about 1,148,200 [5] . Although this number illustrates a dramatic increase in the prevalence of HIV since 1996, it is largely due to the decreased mortality rate associated with the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) [2] ."

Characterization of Variability in Toxicokinetics and Toxicodynamics of Tetrachloroethylene Using the Collaborative Cross Mouse Population,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of interindividual variability is a challenging step in risk assessment. For most environmental pollutants, including perchloroethylene (PERC), experimental data are lacking, resulting in default assumptions being used to account for variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively examined the relationship between PERC toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level to test whether individuals with increased oxidative metabolism are be more sensitive to hepatotoxicity following PERC exposure. METHODS: Male mice from 45 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) were orally administered a single dose of PERC (1,000 mg/kg) or vehicle (Alkamuls-EL620) and euthanized at various time points (n = 1=strain=time). Concentration-time profiles were generated for PERC and its primary oxidative metabolite trichloroacetate (TCA) in multiple tissues. Toxicodynamic phenotyping was also performed. RESULTS: Significant variability among strains was observed in toxicokinetics of PERC and TCA in every tissue examined. Based on area under the curve (AUC), the range of liver TCA levels spanned nearly an order of magnitude ( ∼ 8-fold). Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1 did not correlate with TCA levels. Toxicodynamic phenotyping revealed an effect of PERC on bodyweight loss, induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARa)-regulated genes, and dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Clustering was observed among a) liver levels of PERC, TCA, and triglycerides; b) TCA levels in liver and kidney; and c) TCA levels in serum, brain, fat, and lung. CONCLUSIONS: Using the CC mouse population model, we have demonstrated a complex and highly variable relationship between PERC and TCA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level. https://doi.","Interindividual variability in susceptibility to toxicity has been observed or assumed to exist for all environmental chemicals and drugs; however, little empirical data are available to quantify such differences (Zeise et al. 2013) . Traditional in vivo toxicity testing relies on the use of a single strain of rodent (typically an inbred or hybrid strain), with multiple identical animals being used at each time point or in each dose group; thus, extrapolation from these data to a diverse human population is difficult and necessitates the use of default assumptions. In the past decade, the utility of a mouse population-based approaches to in vivo toxicity testing has been demonstrated for a number of toxic agents and the appreciation of genetics as an important dimension in science and practice of investigative pharmacology and toxicology is increasing (Rusyn et al. 2010) . Importantly, genetically heterogeneous mouse models have been combined with the limited data for interindividual differences in chemical toxicity from human studies to characterize the extent of the variability , discover genetic determinants (Harrill et al. 2009 ), and understand the molecular underpinnings of toxicity (French et al. 2015) ."
Circovirus in Tissues of Dogs with Vasculitis and Hemorrhage,"We characterized the complete genome of a novel dog circovirus (DogCV) from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, vasculitis, and granulomatous lymphadenitis. DogCV was detected by PCR in fecal samples from 19/168 (11.3%) dogs with diarrhea and 14/204 (6.9%) healthy dogs and in blood from 19/409 (3.3%) of dogs with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, fever of unknown origin, or past tick bite. Co-infection with other canine pathogens was detected for 13/19 (68%) DogCV-positive dogs with diarrhea. DogCV capsid proteins from different dogs varied by up to 8%. In situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy detected DogCV in the lymph nodes and spleens of 4 dogs with vascular compromise and histiocytic inflammation. The detection of a circovirus in tissues of dogs expands the known tropism of these viruses to a second mammalian host. Our results indicate that circovirus, alone or in co-infection with other pathogens, might contribute to illness and death in dogs.","C ircoviruses are nonenveloped, spherical viruses with a single-stranded circular DNA genome of ≈2 kb; they group as a genus within the family Circoviridae, together with the proposed genus Cyclovirus and the phylogenetically more distinct genus Gyrovirus (1) . Most of the known species in the genus Circovirus infect birds and cause signs including malformations and necrosis of the integument, lymphoid depletion, and immunosuppression (2) ."
Drug Target Delivery Systems for In Vivo Use of Nucleic Acid Drugs,"The notorious biotechnological advance of the last few decades has allowed the development of experimental methods for understanding molecular mechanisms of genes and new therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy is maturing into a viable, practical method with the potential to cure a variety of human illnesses. Some nucleic-acid-based drugs are now available for controlling the progression of genetic diseases by inhibiting gene expression or the activity of their gene products. New therapeutic strategies employ a wide range of molecular tools such as bacterial plasmids containing transgenic inserts, RNA interference and aptamers. A nucleic-acid based constitution confers a lower immunogenic potential and as result of the high stringency selection of large molecular variety, these drugs have high affi nity and selectivity for their targets. However, nucleic acids have poor biostability thus requiring chemical modifi cations and delivery systems to maintain their activity and ease their cellular internalization. This review discusses some of the mechanisms of action and the application of therapies based on nucleic acids such as aptamers and RNA interference as well as platforms for cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides and their trade-offs.","The discovery of the DNA molecule was one of the most important achievements in the understanding of the fundamental basis of life and now its untapped therapeutic potential is being revealed. Therapies based on nucleic acids (NAs) including plasmids containing transgenes used in gene therapy, antisense and antigene oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, DNA and RNA aptamers and small interfering RNAs, have been developed over the past couple of decades (Crooke, 1998; Stull and Szoka, 1995; Patil et al. 2005; Ulrich et al. 2006) . Although most NA-based drugs are in the early stages of clinical trials, this molecule class has emerged during recent years as promising drug candidates able to act in a large range of diseases including AIDS, cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disorders (Stull and Szoka, 1995; Patil et al. 2005; Ulrich et al. 2006) . The sequencing of the human genome and the transcriptome and proteome projects are providing additional platforms for the advancement of NAbased therapies by supplying new targets for the design, screening and selection of drugs. One of the most signifi cant advantages of NA-based drugs over conventional pharmaceutical drugs is its high selectivity towards its molecular targets resulting in very specifi c physiological action. These drugs can be used to investigate the genetic disease condition or used in prophylactic measures, thereby preventing disease progression and/or complications in its early stages. For instance, gene therapy usually involves the correction of a malfunctioning gene by the introduction and expression of its correct copy, thus resulting in a corrected protein product. Similarly, NA-based drugs involved in gene ablation turn off only selected genes, guaranteeing specifi c control of the disease state. Thus, at least theoretically, the use of NA-based therapies can result in null or minimal collateral effects when compared to conventional, often less specifi c, pharmaceutical drugs."
P1 The conditioning of medical gases with hot water humidifiers P2 Use of a bougie during percutaneous tracheostomy,"During invasive mechanical ventilation due to the dryness of medical gases is necessary to provide an adequate level of conditioning. The hot water humidifiers (HWH) heat the water, thus allowing the water vapor to heat and humidify the medical gases. In the common HWH there is a contact between the medical gases and the sterile water, thus increasing the risk of patient's colonization and infection. Recently to avoid the condensation in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, new heated ventilator circuits have been developed. In this in vitro study we evaluated the efficiency (absolute/relative humidity) of three HWH: (1) a common HWH without a heated ventilator circuit (MR 730, Fisher&Paykel, New Zeland), (2) the same HWH with a heated ventilator circuit (Mallinckrodt Dar, Italy) and (3) a new HWH (DAR HC 2000, Mallinkckrodt Dar, Italy) with a heated ventilator circuit in which the water vapor reaches the medical gases through a gorotex membrane, avoiding any direct contact between the water and gases. At a temperature of 35°C and 37°C the HWH and heated tube were evaluated.","A bougie was used during 46. This technique does not use bronchoscopic control. A bougie is passed through the tracheal tube (TT) into the trachea. The TT is withdrawn until the cuff is above the vocal cords. With the cuff fully inflated, the TT is advanced (using the bougie as a guide) until the cuff impacts on the vocal cords. A gas- Table 1 Complications (type) Number"
Is the risk of multiple sclerosis related to the 'biography' of the immune system?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) with onset in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the infectious background of this disease but the immune reactions against infectious agents in such children have only recently been investigated. These and other epidemiological studies strongly implicate involvement of one or more infectious agents in the aetiology of MS, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the prime candidate. Rather than being the actual cause of MS, it is more probable that these agents are involved in the development of immunoregulatory pathways. These pathways, if disturbed by hygiene-related factors including an altered sequence of infections, may generate and maintain a deficit within the immunological network that facilitates, to particular early events in the development of MS, preceding the onset of MS disease by years or a decade. A framework that can serve as a guide for further epidemiological, immunologic and molecular biologic investigations is formulated. This approach may shed light on the complex natural history of MS and may lead to rational preventive and therapeutic strategies. It is possible that, in the future, MS could be prevented by vaccination against EBV in early childhood; the framework is of relevance to the design of an appropriate type of vaccine.","The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is certainly complex and heterogeneous in nature [1] , involving an interplay between innate and environmental factors [2] [3] [4] and genetic factors, notably the polymorphism of HLA [5] . The epidemiology of this disease strongly indicates that it has emerged as a major neurological disorder in industrially developed nations over the last 150 years and is likely to be affected by hygiene-related factors [3, 6] ."
The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is a discriminator of macrophage function in the inflamed lung Europe PMC Funders Group Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts,"Much of the biology surrounding macrophage functional specificity has arisen through examining inflammation-induced polarising signals, but this also occurs in homeostasis, requiring tissuespecific environmental triggers that influence macrophage phenotype and function. The TAM receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl and MerTK) mediates the noninflammatory removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes through the bridging phosphatidylserinebinding molecules Gas6 or Protein S. We show that one such TAM receptor (Axl) is exclusively expressed on mouse airway macrophages, but not interstitial macrophages and other lung leukocytes, under homeostatic conditions and is constitutively ligated to Gas6. Axl expression is potently induced by GM-CSF expressed in the healthy and inflamed airway, and by type I interferon or TLR3 stimulation on human and mouse macrophages, indicating potential involvement of Axl in apoptotic cell removal under inflammatory conditions. Indeed, an absence of Axl does not cause sterile inflammation in health, but leads to exaggerated lung inflammatory disease upon influenza infection. These data imply that Axl allows specific identification of airway macrophages, and that its expression is critical for macrophage functional compartmentalisation in the airspaces or lung interstitium. We propose that this may be a critical feature to prevent excessive inflammation due to secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells that have not been cleared by efferocytosis.","Tyro3, Axl and MerTK form the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase family and bind Protein S and growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) proteins (Gas6 affinity for Axl>Tyro3>MerTK) whose N-terminal Gla domains bridge TAM receptors to phophatidylserine (PtdSer) on the surface of apoptotic cells, whereas the C-terminal sex hormone-binding globulin-like (SHGB) domain binds and activates the TAM receptor. [1] [2] [3] TAM receptors are broadly expressed by cells of the vascular, nervous, reproductive and immune systems, with mature immune cell populations predominantly expressing Axl and/or MerTK, but not Tyro3. 2 There is some evidence of differential expression of TAM receptors on immune cells in health, 4 and dynamic regulation of Axl and MerTK expression on macrophages by pro-and antiinflammatory factors has recently been characterized. 5 In the innate immune system, TAM receptors inhibit inflammation during apoptotic cell efferocytosis via a negative feedback loop involving activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 that inhibit cytokine and toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways. [6] [7] [8] An absence of TAM receptors results in impaired apoptotic cell clearance, the generation of antibodies to selfcellular antigens 7, 9 and heightened responses to endotoxin 9, 10 and inflammatory cytokines. 11 Given a critical role of TAM receptors in suppressing immune responses, it is not surprising that defects in the TAM receptor system have been identified in patients with autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 7, 12 However, while inhibition of innate inflammation is essential to prevent autoimmunity during apoptotic cell clearance, prolonged engagement of TAM receptors may cause a state of unresponsiveness in antigen presenting cells required to clear pathogenic microorganisms. It is noteworthy that elevated Gas6 plasma levels are observed in patients with severe sepsis 13 and MerTK is elevated on monocytes from patients with septic shock compared to trauma patients and healthy controls, and is linked to an adverse outcome. 14 The mucosal immune system of the lung requires a fine balance between the ability to mount adequate responses to pathogens entering the respiratory tract, and the control of inflammatory processes that might arise from accumulation of large quantities of structural and infiltrating immune cells that undergo apoptosis. 15 Despite this critical regulatory role of efferocytosis in the lung mucosa, little is known about TAM receptors or their ligands in the healthy or inflamed lung. Moreover, in light of recent evidence of an oncogenic function of TAM receptors and initial attempts to block TAM receptor signaling in cancer patients, 16 it is of great interest to understand how manipulation of TAM receptor signaling could affect susceptibility to lung infections. We now show that, unlike the reported dominance of MerTK on murine primary macrophages 4 and the human macrophage cell line U937, 6, 17 Axl was specifically and constitutively expressed on airway, but not interstitial lung macrophages. Inhalation of influenza virus or stimulation of macrophages in vitro with viral PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or type I interferon specifically upregulated Axl. Finally, we show that Axl −/− mice were unable to resolve influenza-induced inflammation causing an accumulation of apoptotic cells and necrotic cell debris. This study provides clear evidence for a constitutive and critical role for the TAM receptor Axl in lung immune homeostasis and in resolution of viral inflammatory lung disease."
Human Bocavirus Infections in Hospitalized Children and Adults,"Studies have reported human bocavirus (HBoV) in children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs), but only occasionally in adults. We searched for HBoV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from adults with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or pneumonia, from children hospitalized for acute RTIs, and from asymptomatic children during the winter of 2002-2003 in Canada. HBoV was detected in NPAs of 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults, 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children, and 43 (43%) of 100 asymptomatic children undergoing elective surgery. Another virus was detected in 22 (71%) of the 31 HBoV-positive NPAs from symptomatic children. Two clades of HBoV were identifi ed. The pathogenic role of HBoV in RTIs is uncertain because it was frequently detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and was commonly found with other viruses in symptomatic children.","H uman bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly described human virus closely related to bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus. It is currently classifi ed in the genus Bocavirus within the family Parvoviridae. This virus was fi rst identifi ed in respiratory tract specimens from Swedish children with lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (1) . Nucleic acid amplifi cation has detected HBoV in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory disease, with incidence rates ranging from 3% to 19% . However, the pathogenic role of HBoV is uncertain because other viruses have been frequently detected in HBoV-positive children with lower RTIs (range 37%-90%) (2, 3, 7, (9) (10) (11) (20) (21) (22) . The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and clinical manifestations of HBoV infections in children and adults with respiratory tract symptoms, including a control group of children without symptoms."
Open and Closed Structures Reveal Allostery and Pliability in the HIV-1 Envelope Spike,"For many enveloped viruses, binding to a receptor(s) on a host cell acts as a first step in a series of events culminating in fusion with the host cell membrane and transfer of genetic material for replication [for review see 1,2 ]. The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is responsible for receptor binding and fusion. While Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in five variable regions (V1-V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that contribute roughly half the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/ CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral fitness. Soluble SOSIP Env trimers are structural and Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.","antigenic mimics of the pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env 3, 4 , targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development [for review see [5] [6] [7] [8] ]. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of subtype B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at resolutions of ~3.7 Å and ~3.6 Å, respectively, and compare them to cryoEM reconstructions of ligand-free B41 SOSIP Env trimers or in complex with either CD4 or CD4bs antibody PGV04, at ~5.6 Å, ~5.2 Å and ~7.4 Å, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description and understanding of the CD4/17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the receptor-binding induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both CD4 and b12 induce large, previously uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 subunits, and the fusion peptide becomes more buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures provide key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from HIV-1 as well as new templates for inhibitor design."
Impact of viral infections in children with community- acquired pneumonia: results of a study of 17 respiratory viruses,Background Little is known about the prevalence of viral infections in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).,"Despite the development of effective antimicrobial therapy, management guidelines, and effective vaccines, communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) remains one of the major causes of morbidity in children living in developed countries, and one of the main causes of mortality in those living in the developing world.

Original StudieS Epidemiology and Virology of Acute Respiratory Infections During the First Year of Life A Birth Cohort Study in Vietnam,"Background: Understanding viral etiology and age-specific incidence of acute respiratory infections in infants can help identify risk groups and inform vaccine delivery, but community-based data is lacking from tropical settings. Methods: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic-and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban-rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants ≥6 months of age than <6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. Conclusions: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting. Public health strategies to reduce infant ARI incidence and hospitalization rates are needed.","A cute respiratory infections (ARI) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children globally, and in particular in low-income countries. An estimated 1.9 million children die from ARI worldwide annually, 70% of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. 1 Studies to define the incidence, age-distribution and etiology of respiratory infections in children can help to identify risk groups and to understand the potential impact of current and future vaccines. Although there exists a large hospital-based literature, [2] [3] [4] [5] including studies from Vietnam, 6, 7 there are limited data on the epidemiology and etiology of ARI from community-based studies, particularly in low income settings. [8] [9] [10] [11] Population-based studies of respiratory syncytial virus infection 9, 12 and influenza 13 have demonstrated a substantial burden of disease, including severe disease, in an outpatient setting that would be missed by hospital-based studies. Longitudinal community-based cohort studies have the benefit of capturing this full clinical spectrum, as well as permitting estimates of incidence, detection of repeated infections and identification of risk factors for infection and disease. However, many previous studies have been limited because they were hospital-based, cross-sectional, small in size, did not include year-round case detection, or focused only on the detection of a specific pathogen."
Human Challenge Pilot Study with Cyclospora cayetanensis,"We describe a pilot study that attempted to infect human volunteers with Cyclospora cayetanensis. Seven healthy volunteers ingested an inoculum of Cyclospora oocysts (approximately 200-49,000 oocysts). The volunteers did not experience symptoms of gastroenteritis, and no oocysts were detected in any stool samples during the 16 weeks volunteers were monitored.","highest oocyst counts were purified and concentrated by sucrose and cesium chloride gradients (1) . See the Table for additional inoculum treatment conditions. Each candidate inoculum was tested for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., Mycobacterium spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, enteroviruses, Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Herpesvirus, Cytomegalovirus, Coronavirus, Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus, Adenovirus, HIV, Clostridium difficile toxin, enterotoxin, and intestinal parasites (data not shown). Serum specimens from the donors of Cyclospora-positive stools were tested for serum markers of HIV, HAV, Hepatitis B virus, and Taenia solium. If serum from a Cyclospora-positive stool donor tested positive for any of the above, oocysts from that person were not used. Candidate inocula in which none of these pathogens or toxins were found were used in the human challenge study. This safety-testing protocol was reviewed and approved by both the University of North Carolina School of Medicine IRB and the CDC IRB. Cell culture infectivity assays and animal models were not available to determine the infectivity or viability of the oocysts. Attempts were made to assess the viability of the inoculum by observing sporozoite motility after excystation of the oocysts by different methods. However, these methods did not yield a sufficient number of motile sporozoites to measure viability."

To overcome this limitation, humanized mouse models are developed based on immunodeficient characteristics of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or recombination activating gene (Rag) null mice, which can accept xenografts. Peripheral constitution of human immunity in SCID or Rag null mice has been achieved by transplantation of mature human immune cells, foetal human thymus, bone marrow, liver tissues, lymph nodes or a combination of these, although efficiency needs to be improved. These mouse models with constituted human immunity (defined as humanized mice in the present text) have been widely used to investigate the basic principles of human immunobiology as well as complex pathomechanisms and potential therapies of human diseases. Here, elements of an ideal humanized mouse model are highlighted including genetic and non-genetic modification of recipient mice, transplantation strategies and proposals to improve engraftments. The applications of the humanized mice to study the development and response of human immune cells, human autoimmune diseases, virus infections, transplantation biology and tumour biology are reviewed as well.","The study of human immunobiology in vivo is limited by technical and ethical constraints. Animal models with humanized immune systems would significantly advance our understanding on human immunobiology and immune-related diseases such as autoimmune diseases, virus infections, as well as tumour and graft rejections. Immunodeficient mice with constituted human immunity have been developed to overcome these constraints and are now important research tools for the in vivo study of human haematolymphopoiesis and immune responses.

ONLINE REPORT,"The World Health Organization R&D Blueprint aims to accelerate the availability of medical technologies during epidemics by focusing on a list of prioritized emerging diseases for which medical countermeasures are insufficient or nonexistent. The prioritization process has 3 components: a Delphi process to narrow down a list of potential priority diseases, a multicriteria decision analysis to rank the short list of diseases, and a final Delphi round to arrive at a final list of 10 diseases. A group of international experts applied this process in January 2017, resulting in a list of 10 priority diseases. The robustness of the list was tested by performing a sensitivity analysis. The new process corrected major shortcomings in the pre-R&D Blueprint approach to disease prioritization and increased confidence in the results.","R ecent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus disease illustrate that emerging infectious diseases will continue to cause major public health emergencies. Further work is needed to strengthen defenses with medical countermeasures (MCMs) and other protective interventions. Building on recent experiences and at the request of the World Health Assembly in May 2015 (1), the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the R&D Blueprint for action to prevent epidemics. This global strategy and preparedness plan is designed to ensure that targeted research and development (R&D) will strengthen emergency response by accelerating availability of biomedical technologies to populations and patients during epidemics (2). The R&D Blueprint focuses on severe emerging diseases that pose a major risk for causing a public health emergency and for which MCMs or substantial R&D initiatives and pipelines are insufficient or nonexistent (3) ."
Origin of Long-Term Storage Stability and Nitric Oxide Release Behavior of CarboSil Polymer Doped with S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-D-penicillamine,"The prolonged and localized delivery of nitric oxide (NO), a potent antithrombotic and antimicrobial agent, has many potential biomedical applications. In this work, the origin of the longterm storage stability and sustained NO release mechanism of Snitroso-N-acetyl-D-penicillamine (SNAP)-doped CarboSil 20 80A polymer, a biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane, is explored. Long-term (22 days) localized NO release is achieved by utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber as topcoats, which can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching from the SNAP-doped CarboSil films, as measured by LC−MS. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAPdoped CarboSil films demonstrate that a polymer−crystal composite is formed during the solvent evaporation process when SNAP exceeds its solubility in CarboSil (ca. 3.4−4.0 wt %). Further, when exceeding this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer. The proposed mechanism of sustained NO release in SNAP-doped CarboSil is that the solubilized SNAP in the polymer matrix decomposes and releases NO, primarily in the water-rich regions near the polymer/solution interface, and the dissolved SNAP in the bulk polymeric phase becomes unsaturated, resulting in the dissolution of crystalline SNAP within the bulk of the polymer. This is a very slow process that ultimately leads to NO release at the physiological flux levels for >3 weeks. The increased stability of SNAP within CarboSil is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the SNAP molecules that crystallize. This crystallization also plays a key role in maintaining RSNO stability within the CarboSil polymer for >8 months at 37°C (88.5% remains). Further, intravascular catheters fabricated with this new material are demonstrated to significantly decrease the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections) (in vitro) over a 7 day period, with 5 log units reduction of viable cell count on catheter surfaces. It is also shown that the NO release catheters can greatly reduce thrombus formation on the catheter surfaces during 7 h implantation in rabbit veins, when compared to the control catheters fabricated without SNAP. These results suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil system is a very attractive new composite material for creating long-term NO release medical devices with increased stability and biocompatibility.","Blood-contacting biomedical devices ranging from simple catheters to complex extracorporeal life support systems 1 are central for everyday medical care. For example, the use of intravascular catheters, which enables direct vascular access, is crucial for patient diagnosis and treatment. However, despite substantial efforts to better understand blood/surface interactions, complications like pulmonary embolism, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis are still associated with the use of indwelling blood-contacting medical devices. 2 In a clinical setting, a systemic anticoagulation agent, such as heparin, is often given to patients in order to reduce the risk of surface-induced thrombus formation. 3 However, heparin treatment should be conducted with extreme care, as an inadvertent overdose of heparin can lead to hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. 4 Although heparin preferentially binds to antithrombin (ATIII), preventing fibrin formation and hindering the development of the hemostatic plug, platelet activation and reduced platelet count is inevitable when foreign surfaces are in contact with blood for a prolonged period. Moreover, biofilm-associated infections are a significant cause of morbidity and death. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most prevalent cause of the high incidence of nosocomial bloodstream infections, specifically, biofilm-associated infections on indwelled biomedical devices. 5, 6 S. aureus biofilms form embedded matrixes which resist both antimicrobials and host defense, thus leading to chronic infections. 7 Therefore, new approaches to reduce the possibilities of these complications and to create truly nonthrombogenic and antimicrobial prosthetic surfaces are still needed within the medical community. 2 Nitric oxide (NO), the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, is a gaseous signaling molecule that has been extensively studied over the past two decades for its role in inhibiting platelet activation and adhesion, preventing bacterial growth, reducing smooth cell proliferation, regulating complex biological processes, etc. 8−31 The ubiquity and apparent chemical simplicity of NO have made it a promising therapeutic agent. The production of NO can be accomplished through either enzymatic or nonenzymatic pathways. 11, 32 Nitric oxide either can be synthesized enzymatically by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that catalyze the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline or can be formed nonenzymatically from the reduction of nitrite 11 or nitrosothiols. The flux of NO released from a healthy endothelium lining, which constitutes the inner walls of all blood vessels, has been estimated to be between 0.5 and 4.0 × 10 −10 mol cm −2 min −1 . 3,10,33,34 Therefore, a potential approach to increase the hemocompatibility of bloodcontacting devices is to develop polymeric materials or coatings with sustained NO release at this physiological flux level. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that surfaces capable of releasing NO at these levels can significantly reduce thrombus formation on the surface of implantable chemical sensors, 35 intravascular catheters, 14, 15 as well as extracorporeal circuits (ECC). 3, 10, 33 Since NO is highly reactive under physiological conditions and has a very short half-life in vivo, 10,36 a wide range of NO donors, such as S-nitrosothiols (RSNO) and N-diazeniumdiolates (NONOate), have been used to prepare NO releasing polymeric matrixes. Such NO donors have been incorporated into various polymers, including polyethylene glycol, 37 Pluronic F127 hydrogel, 12 polyurethanes, 38 poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), 9 xerogel, 39 and poly(vinyl chloride), 23 and these materials can provide continuous and localized NO delivery to specific sites of interest. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), Snitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb), and other endogenous RSNOs are considered NO donors in vivo. However, in recent years, researchers have studied synthetic RSNOs, such as S-nitroso-Nacetylpenicillamine (SNAP). 9,10,18 SNAP is a synthetic tertiary RSNO, and it is more stable than most endogenous primary RSNOs due to the steric hindrance of the sulfur atom. 40, 41 SNAP, like other RSNOs, can decompose and release NO via thermal decomposition, metal ion catalysis (e.g., Cu + ), and photolysis when the light energy corresponds with the SNAP absorption bands at 340 nm and/or 590 nm (see eq 1 for overall reaction). 10,42"
Two resource distribution strategies for dynamic mitigation of influenza pandemics,"submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Abstract: As recently pointed out by the Institute of Medicine, the existing pandemic containment and mitigation models lack the dynamic decision support capabilities. We present two simulation-based optimization models for developing dynamic predictive resource distribution strategies for cross-regional pandemic outbreaks. In both models, the underlying simulation mimics the disease and population dynamics of the affected regions. The quantitybased optimization model generates a progressive allocation of limited quantities of mitigation resources, including vaccines, antiviral, administration capacities, and social distancing enforcement resources. The budget-based optimization model strives instead allocating a total resource budget. Both models seek to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. The models incorporate measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample outbreak in Florida, with over four million inhabitants. The quantity-based model was found to be inferior to the budget-based model, which was advantageous in its ability to balance the varying relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources. The models are intended to assist public health policy makers in developing effective distribution policies for mitigation of influenza pandemics.","Influenza pandemics have historically ensued enormous societal calamities amplified by staggering economic forfeitures. In the U.S. alone, the Spanish flu (1918, serotype H1N1), the Asian flu (1957, H2N2), and the Hong Kong flu (1968, H3N2) resulted in the death toll of more than 500,000, 70,000 and 34,000 cases, respectively. 1 More recently, a series of scattered outbreaks of the avian-to-human transmittable H5N1 virus has been mapping its way through Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, the Near East, and Europe. 2 As of March 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 287 deaths in 486 cases, worldwide. 3 At the same time, in Spring 2009, a milder human-to-human transmissible H1N1 virus subtype resurfaced and propagated to an ongoing global outbreak; as of March 2010, 213 countries have been affected with a total number of infections and mortalities of 419,289 and 16,455, respectively. 4 Today, most experts have an ominous expectation that the next pandemic will be triggered by an emerging highly pathogenic virus, to which there is little or no pre-existing immunity in humans. 5 The ability to contain and mitigate influenza pandemics depends on available emergency response infrastructure and resources, and at present, challenges abound."
Detection of multiple respiratory pathogens during primary respiratory infection: nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate using real-time polymerase chain reaction,"In this study, we present the multiple detection of respiratory viruses in infants during primary respiratory illness, investigate the sensitivity of nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, and assess whether patient characteristics and viral load played a role in the sensitivity. Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants. Rhinovirus (n=67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n=39) were the most frequently detected. Co-infection occurred in 48% (n=45) of the infants. The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs. 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs. 97%). The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT)","value (p<0.001). The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score ≥11). It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the nasal swab can be used, though the sensitivity is lower than the aspirate, in particular, for the detection of mild cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection."
Defense Threat Reduction Agency,"The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was contained largely through traditional public health interventions, such as finding and isolating case-patients, quarantining close contacts, and enhanced infection control. The independent effectiveness of measures to ""increase social distance"" and wearing masks in public places requires further evaluation. Limited data exist on the effectiveness of providing health information to travelers. Entry screening of travelers through health declarations or thermal scanning at international borders had little documented effect on detecting SARS cases; exit screening appeared slightly more effective. The value of border screening in deterring travel by ill persons and in building public confidence remains unquantified. Interventions to control global epidemics should be based on expert advice from the World Health Organization and national authorities. In the case of SARS, interventions at a country's borders should not detract from efforts to identify and isolate infected persons within the country, monitor or quarantine their contacts, and strengthen infection control in healthcare settings.","The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was contained largely through traditional public health interventions, such as finding and isolating case-patients, quarantining close contacts, and enhanced infection control.

Peptide Mimicrying Between SARS Coronavirus Spike Protein and Human Proteins Reacts with SARS Patient Serum,"Molecular mimicry, defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or proteins, is a general strategy used by pathogens to infect host cells. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new human respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV plays an important role in the virus entry into a cell. In this study, eleven synthetic peptides from the S protein were selected based on its sequence homology with human proteins. Two of the peptides D07 (residues 927-937) and D08 (residues 942-951) were recognized by the sera of SARS patients. Murine hyperimmune sera against these peptides bound to proteins of human lung epithelial cells A549. Another peptide D10 (residues 490-502) stimulated A549 to proliferate and secrete IL-8. The present results suggest that the selected S protein regions, which share sequence homology with human proteins, may play important roles in SARS-CoV infection.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease, which was first reported in China in 2002 and was rapidly spreading all over the world in 2003 [1, 2] . The disease was transmitted by droplets and close contact. Patients develop persistent fever, dry cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest, and lymphopenia once infected. Despite treatment, about 10-15% of the patients would die due to the acute respiratory distress [3] [4] [5] [6] . A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was isolated from SARS patients [7] [8] [9] . SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an envelop. The genome of SARS-CoV is around 29,727 nucleotides in length. The sequence was annotatedin silico [10] . Comparative genomic studies using the in silico annotated proteins have suggested that SARS virus belongs to a new group of coronavirus."
,"We compared the prevalence of 8 polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor and mannose-binding lectin genes among 105 children and young adults with fatal infl uenza with US population estimates and determined in subanalyses whether these polymorphisms were associated with sudden death and bacterial co-infection among persons with fatal infl uenza. No differences were observed in genotype prevalence or minor allele frequencies between persons with fatal infl uenza and the reference sample. Fatal cases with low-producing MBL2 genotypes had a 7-fold increased risk for invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) co-infection compared with fatal cases with highand intermediate-producing MBL2 genotypes (odds ratio 7.1, 95% confi dence interval 1.6-32.1). Limited analysis of 2 genes important to the innate immune response found no association between genetic variants and fatal infl uenza infection. Among children and young adults who died of infl uenza, low-producing MBL2 genotypes may have increased risk for MRSA co-infection.","I t is unknown why some apparently healthy persons become severely ill after infl uenza infection while others infected by the same strain remain asymptomatic or become only mildly ill. The presence of neutralizing antibody to a specifi c infl uenza strain is protective, and certain chronic medical conditions increase the risk for severe outcomes of infl uenza infections, but the risk factors for infl uenzaassociated deaths among previously healthy persons remain largely unknown (1) ."
Bat cells from Pteropus alecto are susceptible to influenza A virus infection and reassortment,"Waterfowl are primary hosts for influenza A viruses (IAVs); however, there is sporadic infection of swine and other species that pose a risk of zoonotic spread. Yellow-shouldered bats were shown to be hosts of an IAV, thereby constituting a potential novel reservoir. We show that Pteropus alecto kidney cells (PaKi) are susceptible to infection and sustain replication of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). Importantly, we show that co-infection of PaKi cells results in novel reassortants. Please cite this paper as: Dlugolenski et al. (2013) Bat cells from Pteropus alecto are susceptible to influenza A virus infection and reassortment. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(6), 900-903.","Numerous species are susceptible to infection with influenza A viruses (IAV) including wild and domesticated avian species, horses, dogs, ferrets, swine, whales, and seals. 1 IAVs often cause asymptomatic infections, particularly in wildfowl and shorebirds, 1 and additional species are known to serve as intermediate hosts, which may provide a niche in the evolution and ecology of IAVs. Bats are a species of interest contributing to approximately 25% of all known mammalian species, and bats have emerged as a primary reservoir for a variety of zoonotic diseases spanning numerous virus families including the Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Filoviridae. [2] [3] [4] Bats of the genus Pteropus (flying foxes) were first identified as a reservoir of Hendra virus. 5, 6 Bats have also been identified as reservoirs for other zoonotic diseases such as SARS-COV and Ebola virus. Previously, in the 1970s, influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins were isolated from the lungs and trachea of Nyctalus noctula bats. 7 Recently, a new lineage of IAV was identified from genetic material isolated from rectal swabs of bats indigenous to Guatemala, revealing novel HA and NA subtypes. 8 To date, efforts to isolate and grow this newly identified virus have been unsuccessful. However, the identification of bats as a potential reservoir for IAV is important to understand particularly as related to hostpathogen interactions that include replication, transmission, and adaptation."
,"Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.","Despite major progress toward understanding infectious agents and controlling their spread, new and evolving infectious diseases -as well as old diseases in new contextscontinue to pose threats to humans worldwide. In 1992, the Institute of Medicine published an influential report calling attention to the emergence and re-emergence of human pathogens as a consequence of such factors as evolutionary changes in infectious agents and their human and non-human hosts; alterations in host behaviors and travel; and naturally occurring and man-made shifts in ecology, geography, and environment [1] . During the following decade, renewed concern about microbial threats to health spurred new investments in scientific research and public health infrastructure. In 2003 the Institute of Medicine published a report entitled Microbial Threats to Health, which highlighted the need for a global approach to preparedness [2] . That same year, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic acutely challenged the response capacity of scientists and public health officials across the globe [3, 4] . Advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technology played a pivotal role in identifying the novel coronavirus associated with SARS and in facilitating the development of assays for diagnosis and control [5] ."

"New Hepatitis E Virus Genotype in Camels, the Middle East","In a molecular epidemiology study of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in dromedaries in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, HEV was detected in fecal samples from 3 camels. Complete genome sequencing of 2 strains showed >20% overall nucleotide difference to known HEVs. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed a previously unrecognized HEV genotype.","As part of a molecular epidemiology study, 203 fecal samples from 203 adult dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) were submitted to the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over a 7-month period (January-July 2013). RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed, as described, to detect other positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (5, 6) . Screening for HEV was performed by PCR amplification of a 284-bp fragment of open reading frame (ORF) 2 in HEV; specific primers used were 5′-TTTATTCTC-GTCCAGTCGTTTC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGTGGAG-GACCCATATGT-3′, designed from sequence information from our metagenomic study (P.C.Y. Woo et al., unpub. data) . PCR was performed according to previously described conditions (7); annealing temperature were set at 50°C. DNA sequencing and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR were also performed as described (8) . Using strategies we have reported for other positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses, we performed complete-genome sequencing on 2 HEV-positive samples (5, 6) . Comparative genomic analysis was performed as described (9) . Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MrBayes5D version 3.1.2 (www.fifthdimension.jp/ products/mrbayes5d/) by using an optimal substitution model with 1 million Markov chain Monte Carlo generations; sampling was conducted every 100 generations with a burn-in of 25,000.

,"Subsequently, we determined in a blinded setting the presence of LGV in a selected group of patients (clinical spectrum and epidemiology described elsewhere [8] ) according to C. trachomatis-positive rectal swab (Chlamydia 2SP Collection & Transport Kit [Quelab] by commercially available PCR (COBAS AMPLICOR, Hoffman-La Roche Ltd). By using the 2 reference standard techniques to type C. trachomatis serovars (PCR-based RFLP of the omp1 gene or sequencing the variable segment 2 [VS-2] of the omp1 gene) (9,10) with DNA isolated from rectal swab specimens (standard isopropanol DNA isolation method), we identified 28 of 125 men as LGV-positive. These 28 samples were also positive in both the TaqMan and Rotorgene assays. We also identified 2 additional LGV infections, which were initially typed and then retested as single-strain infections with serovars E and D by both PCRbased RFLP analysis and VS-2 sequencing. This discrepancy is most likely due to a double infection, which will, in most cases, result in the preferential amplification of 1 strain in the omp1 PCR and PCR-based sequencing methods; in the TaqMan and Rotorgene assays, only LGV strains can be amplified. Whether this outbreak is partially technically driven must be assessed in the future by retrospectively investigating the presence of these LGV infections in men who have sex with men and the presence of the L2b strain in the past, since at present only LGV infections from 2003 to 2005 have been investigated.","To the Editor: Less than a year after the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1), 3 independent laboratories reported protection from SARS-CoV challenge in animal models using a DNA vaccine or recombinant forms of the modified vaccinia Ankara or a parainfluenza virus, encoding the spike gene (2) (3) (4) . Their protective efficacies are encouraging because they provide proof that a SARS-CoV vaccine is feasible. However, vaccines based on those technologies are not licensed for human use, and recommendation and licensing will likely take many years. We have developed an inactivated virus vaccine that induces neutralizing antibodies and protects against SARS-CoV challenge."
Human bocavirus infections among children less than two years old in Iran during fall and winter 2012-2013,Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly discovered parvovirus. It has been detected primarily in children with acute respiratory tract infections. This study was conducted to clarify the frequency and genotype circulation pattern of HBoV in Iran. Materials and Methods: Conventional PCR was performed on throat swabs of patients less than two years of age with respiratory illnesses during fall and winter 2012-2013. Results: HBoV virus DNA was detected in 15 of 140 samples (10.7 %). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on 5 samples showed that all were HBoV1.

Evolutionary Bioinformatics colorphylo: A color code to Accurately Display Taxonomic Classifications,"Color may be very useful to visualise complex data. As far as taxonomy is concerned, color may help observing various species' characteristics in correlation with classification. However, choosing the number of subclasses to display is often a complex task: on the one hand, assigning a limited number of colors to taxa of interest hides the structure imbedded in the subtrees of the taxonomy; on the other hand, differentiating a high number of taxa by giving them specific colors, without considering the underlying taxonomy, may lead to unreadable results since relationships between displayed taxa would not be supported by the color code. In the present paper, an automatic color coding scheme is proposed to visualise the levels of taxonomic relationships displayed as overlay on any kind of data plot. To achieve this goal, a dimensionality reduction method allows displaying taxonomic ""distances"" onto a Euclidean two-dimensional space. The resulting map is projected onto a 2D color space (the Hue, Saturation, Brightness colorimetric space with brightness set to 1). Proximity in the taxonomic classification corresponds to proximity on the map and is therefore materialised by color proximity. As a result, each species is related to a color code showing its position in the taxonomic tree. The so called ColorPhylo displays taxonomic relationships intuitively and can be combined with any biological result. A Matlab version of ColorPhylo is available at http://sy.lespi.free.fr/ColorPhylo-homepage.html. Meanwhile, an ad-hoc distance in case of taxonomy with unknown edge lengths is proposed.","Many datasets are ""naturally"" structured as hierarchical classifications. In particular, the Darwin's evolution theory ensures that the relationships between species can be expressed within a tree (named ""phylogenic tree""/""taxonomic tree""). However, the exploration of large trees (and graphs) is not easy. 1 Visualising taxonomy together with other pieces of information (obtained from various biological analyses for example) is often extremely instructive; some examples can be found in. [2] [3] [4] In those cases, a level of granularity of the tree is usually chosen and a color is assigned to each subclass thus defined. 4 Several drawbacks can be easily identified. The granularity level is obviously subject to arbitrariness. Moreover, proximity relationships between subclasses are ignored as well as their subdivisions."
British Columbia Ministry of Health,"Objective To characterize the first-wave epidemiologic features of influenza-like illness (ILI) associated with the novel pandemic A ⁄ H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] virus.

Because A(H1N1)pdm09 had recently emerged in mid-April as a novel virus and in order to characterize its transmission, clinical profile, risk factors, and impact, an outbreak investigation was organized by public health authorities through household telephone survey between May 15 and June 5, 2009 . Initial findings from this investigation have previously been published. 1 Of note, this outbreak investigation provided first detection of an association between prior 2008-2009 trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) receipt and A(H1N1)pdm09 risk that was subsequently confirmed in at least four other studies conducted during the summer, 2009 in Canada. 2 In this paper, we report additional epidemiologic features of influenza-like illness (ILI) experience during this outbreak including characteristics such as medical care, risk factors, and duration of illness both on-and off-reserve. As a further main objective, we evaluate transmission patterns such as the household secondary attack rate (SAR) and serial interval (SI: interval between the index and secondary case), both of which are relevant in planning for and responding to novel influenza virus emergence."
Cell Culture and Electron Microscopy for Identifying Viruses in Diseases of Unknown Cause,"During outbreaks of infectious diseases or in cases of severely ill patients, it is imperative to identify the causative agent. This report describes several events in which virus isolation and identification by electron microscopy were critical to initial recognition of the etiologic agent, which was further analyzed by additional laboratory diagnostic assays. Examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Nipah, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, West Nile, Cache Valley, and Heartland viruses. These cases illustrate the importance of the techniques of cell culture and electron microscopy in pathogen identification and recognition of emerging diseases.","T hin section and negative stain electron microscopy (EM) examination of viruses grown in cultured cells have been instrumental in determining an etiologic agent in numerous disease outbreaks caused by previously unknown viruses. Many examples have been reported. In 1976, EM of cell culture isolates identified the causative virus of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Zaire as a member of the family Filoviridae, now known as Zaire ebolavirus (1) (2) (3) . Reston ebolavirus was another previously unrecognized virus that was detected by cell culture and EM in 1989; it was isolated from cynomolgus monkeys imported into the United States from the Philippines (4) . In Australia in 1994, during an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease in horses and influenza-like illness in humans, a previously unknown virus, Hendra virus, was isolated in culture and recognized as a member of the family Paramyxoviridae by EM (5, 6) . An outbreak of an unidentified rash illness in humans, associated with sick prairie dogs, occurred in the upper midwestern United States in 2003, and EM detected a poxvirus from a cell culture isolate, which was later characterized as monkeypox virus (7, 8) . Recently, the etiologic agent of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in China was isolated and identified by EM as a member of the family Bunyaviridae (9) ."

Enhanced Hygiene Measures and Norovirus Transmission during an Outbreak,"Control of norovirus outbreaks relies on enhanced hygiene measures, such as handwashing, surface cleaning, using disposable paper towels, and using separate toilets for sick and well persons. However, little is known about their effectiveness in limiting further spread of norovirus infections. We analyzed norovirus outbreaks in 7 camps at an international scouting jamboree in the Netherlands during 2004. Implementation of hygiene measures coincided with an 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%-86.6%) reduction in reproduction number. This reduction was unexpectedly large but still below the reduction needed to contain a norovirus outbreak. Even more stringent control measures are required to break the chain of transmission of norovirus.","G astroenteritis is one of the most common causes of illness (1) . Recent fi ndings indicate norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis (2, 3) . Of all gastroenteritis outbreaks reported in the Netherlands during 2002, 54% were caused by norovirus (4) . Norovirus is predominantly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, either indirectly through contaminated food or surfaces or directly from person to person (5) . It can be transmitted through small infectious droplets (aerosols) after a vomiting episode (6, 7) and can survive for a very long time in the environment (5, 8) . Most norovirus outbreaks are seen in settings where clusters of vulnerable, susceptible persons live closely together, such as nursing homes, hospitals, and daycare centers (4) , and in settings in which turnover of susceptible persons is high, such as hotels and cruise ships (9, 10) ."
Pseudoscience in medicine: cautionary recommendations,"Certain real life applications of scientific and social science ideas that knowingly reject accumulated empirical biomedical evidence have been termed 'pseudoscience,' or empirical rejectionism. An uncritical acceptance of empiricism, or even of evidence-based medicine, however, can also be problematic. Objectives: With reference to a specific type of medical denialism associated with moral failure, justified by dissident AIDS and anti-vaccine scientific publications, this paper seeks to make the argument that this type of denialism meets certain longstanding definitions for classification as pseudoscience. Methods: This paper uses a conceptual framework to make certain arguments and to juxtapose arguments for evidence-based approaches to medicine against literature that highlights certain limitations of an unquestioning approach to empiricism. Results: Discussions of certain real life examples are used to derive the important insight that, under certain conditions, moral failure can result in the violation both Type I and Type II scientific error types, with catastrophic consequences. Conclusion: It is argued that the validity of all theory should not be assumed before sufficient empirical evidence has accumulated to support its validity across contexts. However, caution is required, to avoid the consequences of an unquestioning approach to empiricism.","Certain emergent problems with potentially catastrophic consequences require medical responses in a matter of hours, or days. Examples of these include outbreaks of Zika 1 , Ebola 2 , Lassa 3 , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) 4 , swine flu/H1N1 5 , or rapidly increasing global antibiotic resistance 6 . To meet these challenges, healthcare professionals require up to date scientific knowledge. It is not enough that this knowledge is up to date. It also needs to be scientifically rigorous. A reliance on empirical evidence and rigor, however, should not be confounded with a dogmatic faith in empiricism itself, which can also be problematic [7] [8] [9] . In light of this tension, between a need for a pragmatic approach to evidence-based medicine (EBM), and the dangers of an uncritical acceptance of EBM, amidst uncertainties asso-ciated with its shortcomings, this paper seeks to provide a discussion of these issues, and to derive cautionary recommendations for those exposed to these same issues. In doing so,dissident examples of AIDS 10, 11 and vaccine denialism [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] are employed as an interpretive schema, or lens, through which to view events that link dissident perspectives in scientific publication to harmful outcomes. Such an approach offers a useful heuristic in order to highlight a certain type of harmful use of science, which, according to established literature 19 , has previously been categorised as 'pseudoscience.' These examples are taken to represent pseudoscience in medicine, which is defined here as scientific denialism associated with moral failure, justifying itself in terms of dissident scientific publication in order to advance agendas with the potential to do medical harm to human populations. According to Kuhn 20 , [with the exception of extraordinary problems] the ""three classes of problems-determination of significant fact, matching of facts with theory, and articulation of theory-exhaust, I think, the literature of normal science, both empirical and theoretical (p. 34) ."" Medical pseudoscience, as discussed here, falls outside of Kuhn's classes of problem."
Identification of a Peptide for Systemic Brain Delivery of a Morpholino Oligonucleotide in Mouse Models of Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides are emerging treatments for neuromuscular diseases, with several splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) currently undergoing clinical trials such as for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the development of systemically delivered antisense therapeutics has been hampered by poor tissue penetration and cellular uptake, including crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach targets in the central nervous system (CNS). For SMA application, we have investigated the ability of various BBB-crossing peptides for CNS delivery of a splice-switching phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) targeting survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7 inclusion. We identified a branched derivative of the well-known ApoE (141-150) peptide, which as a PMO conjugate was capable of exon inclusion in the CNS following systemic administration, leading to an increase in the level of full-length SMN2 transcript. Treatment of newborn SMA mice with this peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugate resulted in a significant increase in the average lifespan and gains in weight, muscle strength, and righting reflexes. Systemic treatment of adult SMA mice with this newly identified P-PMO also resulted in small but significant increases in the levels of SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) exon inclusion in the CNS and peripheral tissues. This work provides proof of principle for the ability to select new peptide paradigms to enhance CNS delivery and activity of a PMO SSO through use of a peptide-based delivery platform for the treatment of SMA potentially extending to other neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.","S pinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease and a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. It is characterized by the loss of lower motor neurons, which results in progressive atrophy of voluntary muscle groups leading to paralysis and eventually premature death [1] . It is caused by the deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene in more than 95% of SMA patients [2] . Humans have a second nearly identical copy of this gene, SMN2 [2] . The majority (*90%) of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 due to a translationally silent C-to-T transition +6 nucleotides within exon 7 [2] [3] [4] . Skipping of exon 7 during pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing leads to the production of a truncated and only marginally functional SMN protein product [5] . The 10% of SMN2 transcripts that contain exon 7 and which produce full-length functional SMN protein cannot adequately compensate for the loss of SMN1 unless high copy numbers of SMN2 are present, in which case the severity of the disease is reduced [6, 7] . Therefore, the focus of most current therapeutic strategies is to increase the expression of SMN protein by induction of exon 7 inclusion in SMN2."
Minireview Nanoparticles for transcutaneous vaccination,"The living epidermis and dermis are rich in antigen presenting cells (APCs). Their activation can elicit a strong humoral and cellular immune response as well as mucosal immunity. Therefore, the skin is a very attractive site for vaccination, and an intradermal application of antigen may be much more effective than a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. However, the stratum corneum (SC) is a most effective barrier against the invasion of topically applied vaccines. Products which have reached the stage of clinical testing, avoid this problem by injecting the nano-vaccine intradermally or by employing a barrier disrupting method and applying the vaccine to a relatively large skin area. Needle-free vaccination is desirable from a number of aspects: ease of application, improved patient acceptance and less risk of infection among them. Nanocarriers can be designed in a way that they can overcome the SC. Also incorporation into nanocarriers protects instable antigen from degradation, improves uptake and processing by APCs, and facilitates endosomal escape and nuclear delivery of DNA vaccines. In addition, sustained release systems may build a depot in the tissue gradually releasing antigen which may avoid booster doses. Therefore, nanoformulations of vaccines for transcutaneous immunization are currently a very dynamic field of research. Among the huge variety of nanocarrier systems that are investigated hopes lie on ultra-flexible liposomes, superfine rigid nanoparticles and nanocarriers, which are taken up by hair follicles. The potential and pitfalls associated with these three classes of carriers will be discussed.","Infections are responsible for approximately one-third of all deaths occurring each year in the world (World Health Organization, 2008) . Many of these are due to the lack efficient prophylaxis and treatment owing to the unavailability of vaccines and antibiotics or due to the development of drug resistances. In addition, infectious agents are also directly involved in the pathogenesis of many malignant and chronic diseases (Apple et al., 1994; Inman, 2006; Antonelli et al., 2009; Ferreri et al., 2009; Sagaert et al., 2010) . Furthermore, infections are often the final cause of death in patients affected by other primary afflictions (e.g. trauma, cardiovascular or respiratory syndromes). Thus, it is of upmost importance to develop strategies for preventing and treating infectious diseases. In this context, vaccines are the most costefficient tool to prevent infections. Moreover, their therapeutic application for both infectious and non-infectious diseases, including cancer, chronic auto-immune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, is attracting general interest (Weiner and Selkoe, 2002; Zur Hausen, 2002; Meyer-Olson and Witte, 2011) ."
MEDICAL REVIEWS Coronaviruses',"The coronaviruses are a group of RNA-containing agents which have been associated with respiratory illnesses in man and with a number of other conditions in laboratory and domestic animals. The name for the group was adopted to describe the characteristic fringe of crown-like projections seen around the viruses in electron microscopy; these projections are rounded, rather than sharp or pointed, as is the case with the myxoviruses. Like the myxoviruses, the coronaviruses contain essential lipid and are 80-160 nm in diameter (18). While the animal strains are readily isolated in several different systems, recovery of the human strains has posed major problems. A number of these strains have been isolated only in organ culture of the human respiratory tract. This factor has rendered difficult determination of the relationship between isolates and complicated efforts at understanding the role of these viruses in human respiratory illness. Therefore, much of the information on the epidemiology of the agents has come from serologic studies.","The coronaviruses are a group of RNA-containing agents which have been associated with respiratory illnesses in man and with a number of other conditions in laboratory and domestic animals.

Spatiotemporal Interplay of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Respiratory Mucosal Cells Drives Viral Dissemination in Rhesus Macaques HHS Public Access,"Innate immune responses play a critical role in the control of early virus replication and dissemination. It remains unknown, however, how SARS-CoV evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection. Here, we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by T cells, MAC387 + and CD163 + monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway. Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells (LCs) and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes (LNs) within 2 days. In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days. Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days.

The global transmission of SARS-CoV is dependent on the capacity of this virus to efficiently cross from one host to the next by traversing the respiratory mucosa and overcoming host defenses to establish an infection, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. It is surprising that our knowledge of the immune events in the upper respiratory mucosa, in particular during acute respiratory infection, remains rather limited. Although the SARS epidemic was successfully contained by July 2003, there is serious concern regarding a recurrence of severe CoV-mediated disease. In particular, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently been identified as the etiological agent of a severe respiratory illness in patients from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and the United Kingdom 2, 3 . Unraveling how upper airway mucosal exposure of SARS-CoV results in the establishment of infection and subsequent systemic virus dissemination is critical to understand its pathogenesis and to identify key steps for the future prevention of related disease."

Host and viral traits predict zoonotic spillover from mammals HHS Public Access,"The majority of human emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic, with viruses originating in wild mammals of particular concern (e.g. HIV, Ebola, SARS) 1-3 . Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs 4 . However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries 5-7 . Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian hostvirus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range -which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people. Viral zoonoses are a serious threat to public health and global security, and have caused the majority of recent pandemics in people 4 , yet our understanding of the factors driving viral diversity in mammals, viral host range, and cross-species transmission to humans remain nascent.

We use these data to test hypotheses on the determinants of viral richness and viral sharing with humans. We fit three inter-related models to elucidate specific components of the process of zoonotic spillover (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). First, we identify factors that influence total viral richness (i.e. 'baseline' number of unique viral species found in a given host, including those which may have the potential to infect humans). Second, we identify and rank the ecological, phylogenetic, and life-history traits that make some species more likely hosts of zoonoses than others. Third, recognizing that not all mammalian viruses will have the biological capacity to infect humans, we identify and rank viral traits that increase their likelihood of being zoonotic."

BMC Infectious Diseases Date of origin of the SARS coronavirus strains,"A new respiratory infectious epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), broke out and spread throughout the world. By now the putative pathogen of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus, a single positive-strand RNA virus. RNA viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation. It is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus as it spreads through the population. Moreover, finding a date for the last common ancestor of SARS coronavirus strains would be useful for understanding the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the SARS pandemic and the rate at which SARS coronavirus diverge.","A new respiratory infectious epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), broke out and spread throughout the world, affecting over 8,000 individuals in 32 countries [1, 2] . In response to this outbreak, a global network of international collaborating laboratories was immediately sponsored and established by World Health Organization (WHO) to facilitate the identification of the causative agent of SARS. By now the putative pathogen of SARS has been identified, by experimental proof and by Koch's postulates, as a new coronavirus, a single positivestrand RNA virus [3] [4] [5] ]. The whole genome of SARS coronavirus was first sequenced by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Canada on 23, April 2003 [6] , and subsequently a total of 16 SARS coronavirus strains isolated from Hanoi, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were sequenced within short time [7, 8] . Phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic studies based on these genomic sequences indicate that the SARS coronavirus is distinct from any of the previously characterized coronaviruses. Epidemiological investigations further indicate the SARS coronavirus strains may be divided into two different genotypes [9] ."
HIV-1 Frameshift RNA-Targeted Triazoles Inhibit Propagation of Replication-Competent and Multi-Drug-Resistant HIV in Human Cells,"The HIV-1 frameshift-stimulating (FSS) RNA, a regulatory RNA of critical importance in the virus' life cycle, has been posited as a novel target for anti-HIV drug development. We report the synthesis and evaluation of triazole-containing compounds able to bind the FSS with high affinity and selectivity. Readily accessible synthetically, these compounds are less toxic than previously reported olefin congeners. We show for the first time that FSS-targeting compounds have antiviral activity against replication-competent HIV in human cells, including a highly cytopathic, multidrug-resistant strain. These results support the viability of the HIV-1 FSS RNA as a therapeutic target and more generally highlight opportunities for synthetic molecule-mediated interference with protein recoding in a wide range of organisms.","T here is a rapidly expanding recognition that RNA is of high significance as a therapeutic target. 1, 2 In addition to the importance of coding regions of mRNA, noncoding RNA sequences (including miRNA, lncRNA, and others) and structured, regulatory regions of RNA found within coding sequences have been demonstrated to have critical roles in human health and disease. Recent work has revealed the utility of RNA-targeted compounds in the treatment of splicing diseases, 3−8 and as candidate antibiotics via modulation of bacterial riboswitch activity. 9 Finally, RNAs of potential therapeutic significance have also been identified in pathogenic agents, including viruses such as HIV, SARS, and HTLV. 10 One RNA sequence that is particularly attractive both as a model system for fundamental studies of RNA-targeted compound design and as a potential drug target is a highly stable RNA hairpin that serves as a regulatory element in the translation of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1. 11, 12 Specifically, the mRNA encoding these proteins carries a stop codon at the end of the gag gene. In a significant majority of cases (90−95%), the ribosome reads to the end of the gag reading frame, reaches this stop codon, and produces only Gag, a polyprotein that is further processed to yield HIV-1 structural proteins. However, in approximately 5−10% of all gag-pol mRNA translation events, interaction of the ribosome with a particular stemloop within the gag-pol transcript (the HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Stemloop, or HIV-1 FSS RNA) causes it to slip back one nucleotide on an upstream U-rich ""slippery sequence"" (Figure 1 ). When the ribosome resumes the process 25 The slippery sequence is indicated in red, and the frameshift-stimulating stemloop (FSS) employed in these studies is highlighted with a yellow box. of translation, it does so in a new reading frame (a −1 ribosomal frameshift 13 ). As such, it no longer recognizes the gag stop codon and instead continues to process the mRNA until full-length Gag-Pol is produced. Pol consists of vital enzymes of HIV-1 including HIV protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. It is absolutely required for the production of infectious virons. Although a detailed mechanism of frameshifting remains elusive, the high conservation of the FSS RNA sequence in HIV-1 isolates 14 combined with experimental work demonstrating changes in frameshifting frequency as a function of mutations to this RNA 15, 16 suggest that its presence and structure are critical. Alterations in the Gag:Gag-Pol ratio in either direction have been found to substantially reduce the infectivity of product virions. Thus, compounds able to bind this RNA and influence frameshifting have been posited as a new class of anti-HIV agents. 11, 12 To address the general problem of identifying selective binders for biomedically relevant RNA targets, we have developed a discovery protocol based on initial rapid identification of hit molecules using Resin-Bound Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (RBDCC) 17, 18 followed by an iterative medicinal chemistry approach to affinity maturation. As part of this process, it is necessary to convert the disulfide moiety used as a ""mutatable"" group in RBDCC to a nonreducible functional group suitable for further studies in a biological context. Thus far, we have focused on the use of olefins as disulfide isosteres (or, more appropriately, ""bioisosteres"" 19 since the geometry is by no means identical). This strategy has resulted in compounds with relevant activity in vitro and in vivo, including compounds targeting the HIV-1 FSS. 20−22 Our prior efforts toward enhancing the affinity and selectivity of HIV-1 FSS-targeted compounds via directed analog synthesis culminated in the recent disclosure of a series of N-methyl amides with exceptionally high affinity to and selectivity for the FSS RNA. 22 Compound 2, for example ( Figure 2 ), was found to have a dissociation constant (K D ) for the FSS RNA of 13.0 ± 5.0 nM via surface plasmon resonance, approximately 5-fold tighter binding than 1. Compound 2 was also found to inhibit HIV infectivity in a pseudotyped (singlecycle) HIV assay. We have also successfully employed this approach to address a sequence of relevance to triplet repeatmediated splicing disease (Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1, DM1), 23 yielding compounds with activity in a DM1 mouse model. 24 While the affinities and activities of RNA-binding compounds we have synthesized to date incorporating an olefin bioisostere have been encouraging, we sought an alternative disulfide replacement that would permit simpler and more readily scalable synthesis. To that end, the 1,4-triazole substructure seemed particularly attractive, given the highly robust metal-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition conditions that have been developed for its synthesis. 26, 27 Despite the immense body of literature on the use of triazoles in chemistry, including in peptidomimetics, 28, 29 and in RNA-binding compounds, 30−32 there are relatively few examples of this substructure serving as a bioisosteric replacement for a disulfide. In addition to its first reported use in 2004, 33 Suga and colleagues successfully employed intramolecular triazole formation as a disulfide replacement in the context of bicyclic peptides, 34 and a ruthenium-catalyzed cyclization strategy has been described by the Kolmar group for the synthesis of 1,5-disubstituted triazole analogs of cyclic disulfide-containing trypsin inhibitors. 35 In the latter case, inhibitory activity of the triazole peptidomimetic was found to be similar to that of the parent disulfide. Subtle differences between the native disulfide and isosteric triazole have also been reported to have a negative effect on biological activity, however, causing unfolding of insulin glargine analogs. 36 The structural similarities of 1,4-disubsituted triazoles, disubstituted olefins, and disulfides are readily apparent from DFT calculations ( Figure 2) ; however, differences are also obvious. With its calculated local minimum 86.6°torsional angle, consistent with the well-established reference value of 90°for L-cystine, 37 the disulfide bond torsional landscape is quite different from either the olefin or triazole. The distance between flanking alpha carbons is most similar for the trans olefin (5.77 Å vs 5.74 Å for the disulfide). This distance is slightly shorter for the cis olefin (5.32 Å), and over an Ångstrom longer for the triazole (6.94 Å). Electrostatic potential surfaces are also quite different for the three substructures, with the triazole presenting the most overall negatively charged surface. Nonetheless, pendant functionality is capable of being positioned in a similar orientation, and thus we anticipated that the 1,4-triazole would be a suitable disulfide and olefin substitute in HIV-1 FSS binding compounds."

However, this method does not enable the identification of intracellular organisms, and most causes of fever remain unknown. In 2008, we initiated a study of the etiologies of fevers of unknown origin in Africa, particularly in Senegal.

"Citation: Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2011) 1, e27; Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2012) 1, e27","Antisense oligonucleotides and short interfering RNAs (siR-NAs) are nucleic acids-targeting reagents for gene expression modulation that are being developed as drugs for many applications. A number of useful synthetic nucleic acids analogues have been introduced recently to greatly improve their properties for use as therapeutics. However, their full effectiveness in cells and in vivo has often only been realized through development of suitable nonviral delivery systems. Among these, a range of natural and synthetic peptides have been found useful for enhancing cellular uptake and/or cell targeting of oligonucleotide analogues and siRNA. Such peptides are synthetically conjugated, used as noncovalent complexes, or used in combination with polymer, liposomal or exosome formulation techniques. This review begins by describing the modes of action of antisense reagents and siRNA and goes on to focus on recent advances in their peptide-mediated cell and in vivo delivery and how peptide use has influenced drug development. The review discusses the challenges associated with understanding the physiological and toxicological aspects of peptide-mediated delivery. Developments towards clinical use are also highlighted, with particular emphasis on peptide conjugates of oligonucleotide analogues used for treatment of neuromuscular diseases.","Antisense oligonucleotides are used widely to interfere with biological processes in cells and are being developed in some cases as drugs. 1, 2 There are numerous types of oligonucleotide analogue of varying chemistries, as well as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and they encompass a range of intracellular targets and modes of action. Common to all oligonucleotide types is the need to be delivered into cells and tissues efficiently in order to carry out their targeting functions. Some types are able to enter certain cell classes in vivo (such as hepatocytes or kidney cells) reasonably efficiently in naked form (e.g., those containing both phosphorothioate (PS) linkages and certain sugar modifications), 3 but bio-availability at the right cellular location may still be limited by poor cell trafficking and endosomal entrapment. In other cell types, cell targeting and entry is found to be poor for many naked oligonucleotide types, or their ability to reach the desired tissue is limited. Accordingly, there have been massive efforts to search for new delivery systems that may enhance tissue penetration, improve cell targeting and cell entry, as well as enhance intracellular bioavailability at the desired biological target. The most prevalent delivery systems for oligonucleotides and siRNA are cationic liposomes and other nanoparticle delivery systems, based initially on cell culture studies and later translated into sophisticated multicomponent in vivo vectors. 4, 5 Among the simpler methods that have been utilized to enhance cell delivery of oligonucleotides and siRNA are cationic peptide vectors, often referred to as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) or peptide transduction domains (PTDs). The first CPP was introduced in 1994 6 and since then there has been a continuous stream of new peptide delivery vectors where increased delivery and better pharmacological properties are claimed and a variety of applications demonstrated. 7 The cellular entry and intracellular trafficking mechanisms behind peptide-mediated transduction are still not fully elucidated but are reviewed thoroughly elsewhere. [8] [9] [10] [11] In addition to CPPs, there are peptides designed to target to specific cells or tissues (homing peptides). 12 This review concentrates on recent progress (since 2007) in all of the various peptidemediated strategies for delivery of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA into cells in culture and also in in vivo applications, and points to prospects for clinical development."
Locked nucleic acid (LNA) mediated improvements in siRNA stability and functionality,"Therapeutic application of the recently discovered small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing phenomenon will be dependent on improvements in molecule bio-stability, specificity and delivery. To address these issues, we have systematically modified siRNA with the synthetic RNA-like high affinity nucleotide analogue, Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA). Here, we show that incorporation of LNA substantially enhances serum half-life of siRNA's, which is a key requirement for therapeutic use. Moreover, we provide evidence that LNA is compatible with the intracellular siRNA machinery and can be used to reduce undesired, sequence-related off-target effects. LNA-modified siRNAs targeting the emerging disease SARS, show improved efficiency over unmodified siRNA on certain RNA motifs. The results from this study emphasize LNA's promise in converting siRNA from a functional genomics technology to a therapeutic platform.",Double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules have drawn much attention since it was unambiguously shown that they mediate potent gene knock-down in a variety of mammalian cells (1) . This work followed the discovery of the phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans (2) and the demonstration of siRNAs as possible mediators of gene regulation in other eukaryotes (3) (4) (5) .
The Influence of Social-Cognitive Factors on Personal Hygiene Practices to Protect Against Influenzas: Using Modelling to Compare Avian A/H5N1 and 2009 Pandemic A/H1N1 Influenzas in Hong Kong,"Background Understanding population responses to influenza helps optimize public health interventions. Relevant theoretical frameworks remain nascent. Purpose To model associations between trust in information, perceived hygiene effectiveness, knowledge about the causes of influenza, perceived susceptibility and worry, and personal hygiene practices (PHPs) associated with influenza.","Novel respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza A/ H5N1 and most recently pandemic influenza A/H1N1 represent serious public health threats. For influenzas, antivirals enable treatment of infected individuals and chemoprophylaxis of exposed individuals throughout the first wave until vaccines are developed. Non-pharmaceutical interventions may also delay local transmission and mitigate the impact of local epidemics [1] . Although A/H5N1 is predominantly a disease of domestic fowl [2, 3] and rarely occurs among humans, its very high mortality rate and high potential for mutation to readily transmit between humans remain of great concern. In contrast, A/H1N1 is highly contagious among humans but has in most cases a relatively benign clinical profile and low mortality rate [4] ."
Lectins: production and practical applications,"Lectins are proteins found in a diversity of organisms. They possess the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes with known carbohydrate specificity since they have at least one non-catalytic domain that binds reversibly to specific monosaccharides or oligosaccharides. This articles aims to review the production and practical applications of lectins. Lectins are isolated from their natural sources by chromatographic procedures or produced by recombinant DNA technology. The yields of animal lectins are usually low compared with the yields of plant lectins such as legume lectins. Lectins manifest a diversity of activities including antitumor, immunomo dulatory, antifungal, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory, and anti-insect activities, which may find practical applications. A small number of lectins demonstrate antibacterial and anti-nematode activities.","""Lectin"" comes from the Latin word ""legere"", which means ""to select"", by William Boyd in 1954. Lectins have the ability to bind carbohydrates. Nowadays, proteins that can agglutinate red blood cells with known sugar specificity are referred to as ""lectins"". The name ""hemagglutinins"" is used when the sugar specificity is unknown."
World Health Organization Methodology to Prioritize Emerging Infectious Diseases in Need of Research and Development,"All three components of the prioritization process make use of a common set of criteria and sub-criteria. The criteria represent top level factors which might impact the relevance of a disease to the R&D Blueprint, such as the human transmissibility of the disease, or the societal impact. The sub-criteria then explore different facets of each of these areas, for example",considering different types of countermeasures or their suitability for use in different resource settings.
"Oseltamivir-Resistant Infl uenza Viruses A (H1N1) during 2007-2009 Infl uenza Seasons, Japan the Working Group for Infl uenza Virus Surveillance in Japan 1","To monitor oseltamivir-resistant infl uenza viruses A (H1N1) (ORVs) with H275Y in neuraminidase (NA) in Japan during 2 infl uenza seasons, we analyzed 3,216 clinical samples by NA sequencing and/or NA inhibition assay. The total frequency of ORVs was 2.6% (45/1,734) during the 2007-08 season and 99.7% (1,477/1,482) during the 2008-09 season, indicating a marked increase in ORVs in Japan during 1 infl uenza season. The NA gene of ORVs in the 2007-08 season fell into 2 distinct lineages by D354G substitution, whereas that of ORVs in the 2008-09 season fell into 1 lineage. NA inhibition assay and M2 sequencing showed that almost all the ORVs were sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine. The hemagglutination inhibition test showed that ORVs were antigenetically similar to the 2008-09 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2007. Our data indicate that the current vaccine or zanamivir and amantadine are effective against recent ORVs, but continuous surveillance remains necessary.","I nfl uenza A and B viruses are major pathogens that represent a threat to public health with subsequent economic losses worldwide (1) . Vaccination is the primary method for prevention; antiviral drugs are used mainly for prophylaxis and therapy. Currently, 2 classes of drugs, matrix 2 (M2) blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are available, but M2 blockers such as amantadine and rimantadine are not commonly used because of the rapid generation of resistance and lack of effi cacy against infl uenza B virus (2) (3) (4) . The NAIs zanamivir and oseltamivir are widely used because of effects against infl uenza A and B viruses and a low frequency of resistance. NAI virus surveillance studies by several groups have demonstrated that <1% of viruses tested show naturally occurring resistance to oseltamivir as of 2007 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) , indicating limited human-to-human transmission of these viruses."
A novel two-pronged strategy to suppress host protein synthesis by SARS coronavirus Nsp1 protein,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp1 protein suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host translation, in infected cells. We present evidence that nsp1 uses a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation/gene expression. Nsp1 bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit and inactivated the translational activity of the 40S subunits. Furthermore, the nsp1-40S ribosome complex induced the modification of the 5'-region of capped mRNA template and rendered the template RNA translationally incompetent. Nsp1 also induced RNA cleavage in templates carrying the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus, but not in those carrying IRESs from hepatitis C and cricket paralysis viruses, demonstrating that the nsp1-induced RNA modification was template-dependent. We speculate that the mRNAs that underwent the nsp1mediated modification are marked for rapid turnover by the host RNA degradation machinery.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the causative agent of a newly emerged disease, SARS, is an enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of about 29.7 kb.1 Upon infection, the genome expression begins with the translation of gene 1, which constitutes the 5'-end two-thirds of the viral genome, to produce two large precursor polyproteins2,3 that are proteolytically processed by 2 virally encoded proteinases to generate 16 mature proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp162. While Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#terms most of these gene 1 proteins are essential for viral RNA synthesis, some of them appear to have other biological functions. [4] [5] [6] [7] The most N-terminal gene 1 protein, nsp1, has unique biological functions; expressed SCoV nsp1 induces host mRNA degradation and suppresses host translation8. The expressed nsp1 suppresses the host antiviral signaling pathways as well9. Furthermore, nsp1 suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon (IFN) production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and host translation suppression in infected cells10. The nsp1 of a closely related mouse hepatitis virus also suppresses host gene expression and is a viral virulence factor11. These data suggest that the SCoV nsp1-mediated suppression of host genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS. Accordingly, a delineation of the mechanisms of the nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression is considerably important for gaining insight into SCoV pathogenesis at the molecular level. We designed the present study to uncover the mechanism of nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression primarily by using an in vitro system. Our data revealed that nsp1 utilizes a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation/gene expression."
Immunofluorescence Assay for Serologic Diagnosis of SARS,We evaluated an indirect immunofluorescence assay based on virus-infected cells for detecting anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody. All confirmed SARS cases demonstrated seroconversion or fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer; no control was positive. Sensitivity and specificity of this assay were both 100%. Immunofluorescence assay can ascertain the status of SARS-CoV infection.,"We conducted this study at the teaching hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, where a major outbreak of SARS had occurred (9) . Patients admitted with clinical features suggestive of SARS were investigated for SARS-CoV infection by a combination of methods including direct detection of viral RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers COR1/COR2 (10) , virus isolation using African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, and serology. All RT-PCR-positive results were confirmed by repeat testing from the original sample; isolation positive results were confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV RNA from culture supernatant by RT-PCR."
Highly Efficient and Practical N-Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalyzed Chemoselective N 1 /C 3 -Functionalization of Isatins with Green Chemistry Principles,"Ecofriendly N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis can control the N 1 -functionalization (aza-Michael addition) and C 3 -functionalization (Morita−Baylis− Hillman reaction, MBH) of isatins in the absence of (1) a protecting group, (2) a stoichiometric reagent, and (3) heat energy. The challengeable N 1 -functionalization of N-unsubstituted isatins into N-substituted (NS) isatins was realized through 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,8diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene catalysts within 10 min with up to 98% isolation yield. The subsequent MBH adducts of assynthesized NS-isatins (N 1 /C 3 -functionalization) was perfectly acquired in 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane catalysis within 30 min with superiority to C 3 /N 1 -functionalization (MBH/aza-Michael). For guiding the application to a versatile druggable isatin library, the NHC catalysis was compared with reported functionalization of isatins in view of green chemistry principles including solvent scoring of ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable, E-factor, atom economy, and so on.","Isatin is not only a privileged core structure of versatile natural products, but also a very useful starting material of indolecontaining biologically active molecules because of the presence of various functionalizable groups ( Figure 1 ). 1−6 Specifically, this potential has been realized in designing useful drug scaffolds for emerging targets (e.g., chymotrypsin-like protease, Nrf2) as well as well-known targets binding to neurotransmitters or their precursors (e.g., MAO, CB2). 7−10 However, when compared with the powerful utility of isatin, it seems that efficiently controlled introduction of functional groups into isatin has not been reported enough. Even though reactive isatins prefer nucleophilic additions at the C 3position, 11−17 the control of N 1 -and C 3 -functionalization has been tried by various synthetic strategies (N-alkylation, 18−21 N-acylation, 22 ,23 N-carbamoylation, 24 N-Mannich reaction, 25, 26 and aza-Michael addition reaction 27−34 ) . Despite reports, efficient chemoselective N 1 -functionalization of isatin is still difficult because of the undesired reactions resulting from the multifunctionality of isatins. The first undesired side reaction in the functionalization of isatins is the decomposition of isatins into isatinates. 35−37 The second undesired reaction is products resulting from the failure of the chemoselectivity (C 3 -vs N 1 -site). Any organic or inorganic base in an optimized method could not show consistent products in diverse isatin derivatives and electrophiles. For example, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)/ tetrabutylammonium bromide of catalytic amount could only be applicable to Schiff imine protection of isatins for aza-Michael product (N 1 -functionalization). 28 In N-unprotected isatins, DABCO is a more efficient base for Morita−Baylis− Hillman (MBH) reaction (C 3 -functionalization) rather than aza-Michael reaction (N 1 -functionalization). 16, 17 Hence, surely C 3 -protecting groups of isatins (e.g. ketal, 18, 21 Schiff imine, 28−31 thioketal 32 ) have been developed. Notably, aza-Michael reaction of Kanger group's isatin Schiff imine are only applicable for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors, 28−30 and ketal/thioketal shows a loss of isatins as well as a high Efactor (low atom economy) through protection/reaction/ deprotection procedures (Supporting Information). 21, 32 Recently, aza-Michael addition of isatins without any C 3protecting group 27, 33, 34 made us to expect efficient direct N 1functionalization to be more considerable in view of green chemistry (E-factor, atom economy, and step economy). Kinetics of the saponification depend on the pH of reactions so that a stoichiometric inorganic base can result in the saponification of the aza-Michael products as well as isatins (Supporting Information). 27, 35 Aza-Michael reaction in imidazolium ionic liquids was applicable only for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors in spite of a high expenditure of the ionic liquid. 33 Remarkably, Pace group's N 1 -functionalization could show a powerful advance, but the recyclable KF−Celite mediation required more than the stoichiometric amount as well as a long time reflux (ca. 12 h) for efficient aza-Michael reaction. 34 In this study, we investigated neither the stoichiometric condition nor the heating energy required for chemoselective N 1 -functionalization of isatins. Therefore, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis was a reasonable method based on (1) the extrapolated reactivity between activated olefins and NHCs from the literature 38−48 and (2) mild condition escaping saponification. 42, 43 The stabilized sp 2hybridized lone-pair electrons of NHCs make C2-carbene highly nucleophilic with the basicity (pK a : 20−28 in tetrahydrofuran (THF)) 51 and its precatalysts have the advantages (readily available, cheap, less toxic than metal catalysts, easy to synthesize, and recyclable) required for green catalysis. 42, 43 NHCs and imidazolium salts, conjugated acids of NHCs, can play powerful roles in Lewis/Brønsted base catalysis, and can facilitate various reactive species (e.g. acyl anions, homoenolates, acylvinyl anions, and enolates) for synthesizing a versatile compound collection. 42−50 Although the concept of NHC-catalyzed Michael addition exists, 38−41 the scope of the nucleophile was limited to primary amines, 38 1,3-dicarbonyls, 39, 40 and thiols 41 but not for amides, especially not for isatins. Herein, we report the efficient NHCorganocatalyzed chemoselective aza-Michael addition of Nunsubstituted (NUS)-isatins for synthesizing N-substituted (NS)-isatins (N 1 -functionalization) in the absence of (1) a protecting group, (2) a stoichiometric reagent, and (3) heating energy. The usefulness of the aza-Michael adducts can be reinforced with the subsequent MBH reaction of assynthesized NS-isatins (N 1 /C 3 -functionalization) and the reverse synthesis (C 3 /N 1 -functionalization) to construct versatile isatins as a drug library."
Systems biology approaches to disease marker discovery,"Our understanding of human disease and potential therapeutics is improving rapidly. In order to take advantage of these developments it is important to be able to identify disease markers. Many new high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies are being implemented to identify candidate disease markers. These technologies include protein microarrays, next-generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms. Such methods are particularly important for elucidating the repertoire of molecular markers in the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of patients with diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections, resulting from the disruption of many biological pathways. These new technologies have identified many potential disease markers. These markers are expected to be valuable to achieve the promise of truly personalized medicine.","Disease markers are of vital importance to clinicians and their patients as early detection, accurate prognosis/diagnosis and monitoring of therapy can lead to increased overall survival and cure rates. As our knowledge of diseases quickly expands, the field of disease marker discovery will play increasingly important roles in the delivery of improved diagnosis and treatment. These markers, such as protein (including autoantibodies, which are antibodies specific to self-antigens [43] ), hormonal markers (such as lack of insulin in Type I diabetic patients [89] ), and genetic/genomic markers (such as BRCA1 mutation in breast cancer patients [52] ), enable clinicians to diagnose the disease while it is still at early stages, to ensure appropriate surgical intervention, efficient drug treat-ment and monitoring, and to predict an individual's risk of developing specific diseases before they experience symptoms. Traditionally, discovery and detection of these disease markers relied on low throughput technologies such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) or 2D-gel plus Edman degradation for protein markers, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for mRNA markers, and restriction enzyme digestion, cloning and Sanger sequencing for DNA markers. Before the dawn of high-throughput technologies these methods played important roles in marker identification and yielded significant discoveries in various diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer [32, 52, 107] , which greatly enhanced the diagnostic efficiency in these diseases."
On computational approaches for size-and-shape distributions from sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation,"Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation has become a very popular technique to study size distributions and interactions of macromolecules. Recently, a method termed two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) for the determination of size-and-shape distributions was described by Demeler and colleagues (Eur Biophys J 2009). It is based on novel ideas conceived for fitting the integral equations of the size-andshape distribution to experimental data, illustrated with an example but provided without proof of the principle of the algorithm. In the present work, we examine the 2DSA algorithm by comparison with the mathematical reference frame and simple well-known numerical concepts for solving Fredholm integral equations, and test the key assumptions underlying the 2DSA method in an example application. While the 2DSA appears computationally excessively wasteful, key elements also appear to be in conflict with mathematical results. This raises doubts about the correctness of the results from 2DSA analysis.","The use of sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV) has significantly expanded in the last decade (Howlett et al. 2006; Scott and Schuck 2006; Cole et al. 2008) , and new computational methods for SV analysis are being actively developed by several groups (Balbo et al. 2005; Philo 2006; Brown et al. 2007 Brown et al. , 2009 Behlke and Ristau 2009; Brookes et al. 2009; Correia and Stafford 2009) . In particular, diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation coefficient distributions calculated from direct boundary modeling of experimental data (Schuck 2000; Schuck et al. 2002) have proven to be very useful tools in many biophysical applications (for a list of references see Schuck 2007) . They can achieve relatively high hydrodynamic resolution of pauci-and polydisperse macromolecular mixtures, exhibit exquisite sensitivity for trace components (Berkowitz 2006; Liu et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2008a, b; Gabrielson et al. 2009 ), and can be related to sedimentation coefficient isotherms and Gilbert-Jenkins theory for the analysis of slowly or rapidly interacting systems (Dam and Schuck 2005; . The extension of sedimentation coefficient distributions to two-dimensional sizeand-shape distributions was introduced (Schuck 2002 ; Brown and Schuck 2006) and applied in numerous studies (Markossian et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2007; Race et al. 2007; Broomell et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Chebotareva et al. 2008; Iseli et al. 2008; Moncrieffe et al. 2008; Paz et al. 2008; Sivakolundu et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Eronina et al. 2009; Mortuza et al. 2009 ). More recently, the Demeler laboratory has described the concept of a novel algorithm (''2DSA'') for determining size-and-shape distributions, as implemented in the software ULTRASCAN (Brookes et al. 2006 , 2009 Demeler et al. 2009 ). In the present work, we critically compare the background of the different algorithms and assess their performance."
Author affi liations: University of North Carolina Health Care Sys-tem,"Despite widespread use of communicable disease surveillance data to inform public health intervention and control measures, the reporting completeness of the notifiable disease surveillance system remains incompletely assessed. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study of reporting completeness with an analysis of 53 diseases reported by 8 health care systems across North Carolina, USA, during 1995USA, during -1997USA, during and 2000USA, during -2006. All patients who were assigned an International Classifi cation of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifi cation, diagnosis code for a state-required reportable communicable disease were matched to surveillance records. We used logistic regression techniques to estimate reporting completeness by disease, year, and health care system. The completeness of reporting varied among the health care systems from 2% to 30% and improved over time. Disease-specifi c reporting completeness proportions ranged from 0% to 82%, but were generally low even for diseases with great public health importance and opportunity for interventions.","S urveillance has been the cornerstone of public health since the US Congress authorized the Public Health Service to collect morbidity data for cholera, smallpox, plague, and yellow fever in 1878. Currently, all states conduct notifi able disease surveillance following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The current list of nationally notifi able communicable diseases has expanded to >60 diseases and includes vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., pertussis, measles), emerging infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus encephalitis), foodborne diseases (e.g., Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. infections), sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., syphilis, HIV), and aerosol and droplet transmitted diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, meningococcal meningitis). Active surveillance programs conducted by CDC in conjunction with certain states include Active Bacterial Core surveillance, FoodNet, and infl uenza-related hospitalization surveillance. Surveillance of epidemiologically important diseases provides critical information to clinicians and public health offi cials for use in measuring disease incidence in communities, recognizing disease outbreaks, assessing prevention and control measure effectiveness, allocating public health resources, and further clarifying the epidemiology of new and emerging pathogens (1) ."
Enhancing Time-Series Detection Algorithms for Automated Biosurveillance,"BioSense is a US national system that uses data from health information systems for automated disease surveillance. We studied 4 time-series algorithm modifi cations designed to improve sensitivity for detecting artifi cially added data. To test these modifi ed algorithms, we used reports of daily syndrome visits from 308 Department of Defense (DoD) facilities and 340 hospital emergency departments (EDs). At a constant alert rate of 1%, sensitivity was improved for both datasets by using a minimum standard deviation (SD) of 1.0, a 14-28 day baseline duration for calculating mean and SD, and an adjustment for total clinic visits as a surrogate denominator. Stratifying baseline days into weekdays versus weekends to account for day-of-week effects increased sensitivity for the DoD data but not for the ED data. These enhanced methods may increase sensitivity without increasing the alert rate and may improve the ability to detect outbreaks by using automated surveillance system data.","S ince the late 1990s, the threats of bioterrorist attacks, the potential for outbreaks of natural disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic infl uenza, and the availability of computerized data have prompted the use of automated disease surveillance systems (1) . Sources of information include clinical data, such as records of hospital emergency department visits, and nonclinical information, such as sales of over-the-counter remedies (2) ."
"Frequency of human bocavirus (HBoV) infection among children with febrile respiratory symptoms in Argentina, Nicaragua and Peru","Background Globally, respiratory infections are the primary cause of illness in developing countries, specifically among children; however, an etiological agent for many of these illnesses is rarely identified.","Globally, respiratory infections are one of the primary causes of illness in developing countries, specifically among children younger than 5 years old. However, the etiology of these acute respiratory infections diagnosed as pneumonia is determined in only 75% of the cases. 1 Of these identified respiratory pathogens, typically determined with molecular techniques, viruses account for approximately 15% of the infections. 2 Nonetheless, by employing molecular diagnostic techniques in hospital-based studies, one can typically identify up to 90% of the viral agents associated with respiratory tract infections. 3 Human bocavirus (HBoV) was originally described by Allander et al. 4 among children with respiratory tract infection in Sweden, 2005. Since then, it has been reported in different countries 3, [5] [6] [7] and in patients of differing ages, although the majority of the infections have been detected in young children. 5, 6 Although our understanding of the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of this novel virus has been enhanced with the increasing information, we are still unable to discern the role of this virus in respiratory infections. [8] [9] [10] Longtin et al. and Garcia-Garcia et al. have also identified the virus among asymptomatic children. 11 The virus has also been identified in fecal samples of Spanish and Brazilian children with diarrheal symptoms. 12 Additionally, it is not uncommon to find the virus in co-infection with other known pathogens. Given these inconclusive and confusing findings, the scientific community remains divided as to whether HBoV is a true respiratory pathogen."
Injection Route and TLR9 Agonist Addition Significantly Impact Heroin Vaccine Efficacy,"Active immunization is an effective means of blocking the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs and holds promise as a treatment for heroin addiction. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of our first-generation vaccine in blocking heroin self-administration in rats, however, many vaccine components can be modified to further improve performance. Herein we examine the effects of varying heroin vaccine injection route and adjuvant formulation. Mice immunized via subcutaneous (sc) injection exhibited inferior anti-heroin titers compared to intraperitoneal (ip) and sc/ip coadministration injection routes. Addition of TLR9 agonist cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG ODN 1826) to the original alum adjuvant elicited superior antibody titers and opioid affinities compared to alum alone. To thoroughly assess vaccine efficacy, full dose−response curves were generated for heroin-induced analgesia in both hot plate and tail immersion tests. Mice treated with CpG ODN 1826 exhibited greatly shifted dose−response curves (10−13-fold vs unvaccinated controls) while non-CpG ODN vaccine groups did not exhibit the same robust effect (2−7fold shift for ip and combo, 2−3-fold shift for sc). Our results suggest that CpG ODN 1826 is a highly potent adjuvant, and injection routes should be considered for development of small molecule−protein conjugate vaccines. Lastly, this study has established a new standard for assessing drugs of abuse vaccines, wherein a full dose−response curve should be performed in an appropriate behavioral task.","Heroin is a highly addictive semisynthetic opioid derived from the diacetylation of morphine. Indeed, heroin abuse is a significant problem that incurs large social and economic costs worldwide. 1, 2 Alarmingly, the number of heroin users in the U.S. has grown by 50% from 2002 to 2010. 3 Furthermore, since 2007 the number of deaths due to heroin overdose has also increased. 4 Due to the severity of heroin addiction, there is a dire need for anti-heroin addiction treatments that are more effective than currently available pharmacological agents (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone). The first report of a working heroin vaccine was disclosed in 1974, 5 however, further research on heroin immunopharmacotherapy has only been conducted in the past decade. 6, 7 Previously, we reported the design of a heroin−KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) immunoconjugate ( Figure 1 ) that showed ample promise in combination with alum adjuvant as a vaccine against heroin addiction. 8 As a testament to the vaccine's efficacy, immunization of heroin-dependent rats prevented relapse to compulsive intake of heroin in self-administration models. 9 Herein, we sought to further improve our vaccine's performance through injection route and adjuvant exploration."
Impairment of germline transmission after blastocyst injection with murine embryonic stem cells cultured with mouse hepatitis virus and mouse minute virus,"The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of murine embryonic stem (mESCs) to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) and mouse minute virus (MMVp) and the effect of these viruses on germline transmission (GLT) and the serological status of recipients and pups. When recipients received 10 blastocysts, each injected with 10 0 TCID 50 MHV-A59, three out of five recipients and four out of 14 pups from three litters became seropositive. When blastocysts were injected with 10 -5 TCID 50 MMVp, all four recipients and 14 pups from four litters remained seronegative. The mESCs replicated MHV-A59 but not MMVp, MHV-A59 being cytolytic for mESCs. Exposure of mESCs to the viruses over four to five passages but not for 6 h affected GLT. Recipients were seropositive for MHV-A59 but not for MMVp when mESCs were cultured with the virus over four or five passages. The data show that GLT is affected by viruscontaminated mESCs.","Transfection of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with the desired gene constructs and injection into blastocysts coupled with transfer to suitable recipients is a standardized method for producing transgenic mice (Gossler et al. 1986 ). However, besides feeder cells and blastocysts, mESCs can harbor murine pathogens (Okumura et al. 1996; Kyuwa et al. 1997) and their introduction into a mouse colony can lead to spread of infections. Due to the exchange of mESCs between laboratories worldwide the risk of transmitting mouse infectious agents may even be higher since mESCs are often not screened for viruses and contamination and infection with viruses cannot be detected on the basis of cell morphology."
"Epidemiology of Imported Infectious Diseases, China, 2005-2016","and analyzed demographic, temporal, and spatial distributions. The number of types of imported infectious diseases reported increased from 2 in 2005 to 11 in 2016. A total of 31,740 cases of infectious disease were imported to mainland China during 2005-2016; most of them were found in Yunnan Province. The cases were imported mainly from Africa and Asia. As a key and effective measure, pretravel education should be strengthened for all migrant workers and tourists in China, and border screening, cross-border international cooperation, and early warning should be further improved.","T he advance of globalization, frequent personnel exchanges, and close international trade cooperation make it possible for infectious diseases from all over the world to be imported into China. The number of persons entering and leaving China has been steadily increasing, from 302 million person-times in 2005 to 570 million person-times in 2016, and the number of visitor arrivals in Yunnan Province has increased from 1. Some infectious diseases have been reemerging, such as epidemic hemorrhagic fever and malaria, which previously had basically been controlled, and wild poliovirus, which had been eliminated in China in 2000. After >10 years without a case of wild poliovirus infection in China, an outbreak of wild poliovirus infection occurred in 2011 in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (2) . A few emerging infectious diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), yellow fever, and Zika virus disease, have also been imported into China."

At that time, my vague notions of public health were only that somehow it helped prevent diseases. As I prepare to retire from the position of Director of Public Health and Health Officer for our nation's most populous county, I reflect on the time that has passed between that day and now.","Persuading others that public health makes a contribution distinct from that of medical services has not always been simple. Fast forward to 1998. After a year of consulting on how to improve governmental public health in Los Angeles County and collaborating with other public health experts to develop many recommendations that were adopted by the county governing body, I accepted the job as county Director of Public Health. Public health was housed within the larger County Department of Health Services and constituted a small portion of its workforce and budget. Public health issues and concerns were often overshadowed by constant crises in health services financing and quality of care. These uniformly took precedence over public health's efforts to hire new staff and to strengthen internal capacity in areas such as chronic disease control, environmental health, and analytics."

,"For pandemic infl uenza planning, realistic estimates of personal protective equipment (PPE) and antiviral medication required for hospital healthcare workers (HCWs) are vital.

Based on World Health Organization defi nitions and guidelines, the mean number of ""close contacts"" of the API patient was 12.3 (range 6-17; 85% HCWs); mean ""exposures"" were 19.3 (range 15-26). Overall, 20-25 PPE sets were required per patient, with variable HCW compliance for wearing these items (93% N95 masks, 77% gowns, 83% gloves, and 73% eye protection). Up to 41% of HCW close contacts would have qualifi ed for postexposure antiviral prophylaxis. These data indicate that many current national stockpiles of PPE and antiviral medication are likely inadequate for a pandemic.",of current stockpiles.

,"finding of the clinical and the environmental isolate (1,2). The existence of MATa in nature is also supported by recent studies designed to established the origin of the serotype AD strains (4, 5) . These studies demonstrated that AD strains were diploid or aneuploid hybrids derived from a fusion of serotype A and D parents and that several of them were harboring a serotype A MATa locus. These hybrid strains have been found fairly often in Europe (9,10).","To the Editor: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease worldwide, and relapsing SARS is a major concern. We encountered a 60-year-old woman who was admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong on March 29, 2003, with a fever of 39°C, chills, cough, malaise, and sore throat for 2 days before admission. She had no history of travel within 2 weeks of admission. She also had no close con-tact with patients who had a diagnosis of suspected or confirmed SARS. Chest radiograph on admission indicated consolidation over the right middle zone. In accordance with the diagnostic criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), this patient's condition was diagnosed as SARS in view of her symptoms, temperature, and chest radiograph findings (1) ."
A Mouse-Adapted SARS-Coronavirus Causes Disease and Mortality in BALB/c Mice,"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease. Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation. They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection. Older (12-to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies. We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus. Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS. The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology. This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals. Citation: Roberts A, Deming D, Paddock CD, Cheng A, Yount B, et al. (2007) A mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus causes disease and mortality in BALB/c mice. PLoS Pathog 3(1): e5.","The occurrence in late 2002 and early 2003 of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southeast China quickly drew international attention as the disease sickened more than 8,000 people and spread to more than 30 countries within six months. Since the identification of the etiological agent, the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2003, development and characterization of animal models for evaluation of prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been of great interest. Although SARS-CoV has not been associated with a subsequent widespread outbreak since 2002-2003, the potential for such an outbreak remains. Identification of a SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) that are indigenous across Southeast Asia suggests that they may represent a natural reservoir from which viruses may be introduced into the human population [1] . The course of infection in animal models is abbreviated compared with the course of SARS in humans; however, many aspects of SARS-CoV-associated disease are reproducible in animal models, including age-dependent susceptibility, re-covery of SARS-CoV from respiratory tissues and secretions, infection of type I and type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, detection of viral genome in blood and extrapulmonary tissues, and pulmonary pathology (including pneumonitis, edema, necrotic debris, and hyaline membrane formation) [2, 3] . Clinical symptoms have been reported in some species, but the findings are not entirely reproducible in outbred species. Variability in clinical symptoms seen in outbred species may result from additional factors, including infection with co-pathogens, stress, existence of sub-species of test animals, and use of different virus strains. This variation can be problematic in studies of pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy unless a large enough number of animals are included in each treatment group [2] . The ideal animal model would demonstrate viral replication in respiratory tissues, histopathologic evidence of respiratory disease, and consistent clinical signs of disease, including mortality. A small animal model in which all of these aspects of virus-associated disease are seen would be desirable because reproducible data can be generated in inbred animals, and larger numbers of animals can be included for statistical analysis of biological outcomes."
Comparative Pathogenesis and Systems Biology for Biodefense Virus Vaccine Development,"Developing vaccines to biothreat agents presents a number of challenges for discovery, preclinical development, and licensure. The need for high containment to work with live agents limits the amount and types of research that can be done using complete pathogens, and small markets reduce potential returns for industry. However, a number of tools, from comparative pathogenesis of viral strains at the molecular level to novel computational approaches, are being used to understand the basis of viral attenuation and characterize protective immune responses. As the amount of basic molecular knowledge grows, we will be able to take advantage of these tools not only to rationally attenuate virus strains for candidate vaccines, but also to assess immunogenicity and safety in silico. This review discusses how a basic understanding of pathogenesis, allied with systems biology and machine learning methods, can impact biodefense vaccinology.","We have traditionally associated the term ""Biodefense"" with military applications. However, since October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent in envelopes through the US Postal Service, our understanding of biodefense has shifted significantly. We now see biodefense as the process to protect both civilian and military populations. It has become clear that many highly pathogenic microorganisms can be considered as either agents of biological warfare or naturally occurring emerging disease threats. In addition, we consider bioterrorism from varying points of view, including public health threats, veterinary threats, and agricultural threats. Taken together, they can be considered to be ""biothreats"". The biodefense field represents a unique challenge for vaccine development as the traditional economic models for vaccine development are based on large populations purchasing a vaccine to protect against common infectious diseases in order that a vaccine pharma can make a profit. The situation in biodefense is very different where the goal is to stockpile vaccines with the hope that they will never be used. Relatively small markets, combined with the difficulties of working with many of these agents-many of which require biosafety level 3 or 4 containment-means that there are currently no vaccines licensed for general use in the United States and most other countries for nearly all of the biothreat agents. There are major hurdles to the development of biodefense vaccines. In addition to the traditional issues of identifying protective immunogens and platforms to deliver the vaccines, there are major difficulties in undertaking efficacy studies as most of the diseases are rare, occur sporadically, or are not found naturally. Accordingly, emphasis is being placed on appropriate animal models to demonstrate efficacy in support of licensure. However, at this time, no vaccine has been approved based on animal efficacy trials only. Nonetheless, a significant amount of data are being accumulated describing the molecular basis of disease, which provides a strong foundation for continuing product development. The current state of biodefense vaccines in clinical development is summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 : Current status of vaccines in clinical trials against priority pathogens and potential biothreat agents. Data for the table come from http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ and other sources as indicated. Many vaccines are in preclinical development, including a number of candidate vaccines for Lassa virus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and Sin Nombre [7, 8] The advent of the 21st century has seen our expertise in molecular biology increase exponentially. With the increasing affordability of high-throughput sequencing, concepts such as reverse vaccinology-using pathogen genome sequences to produce peptides and nucleic acids for vaccine testing-have become more established [11, 12] . As our understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis continues to grow, coupled with large numbers of genome sequences for various pathogens becoming available and novel bioinformatics tools to facilitate their analysis, we are heading towards a position where vaccines can be rationally designed based on our molecular knowledge. This includes selection of an optimum immunogen and delivery system to maximize the host protective immune response rather than empirical approaches that were used for much of the 20th century. The continuing generation of high-throughput datasets characterizing high-priority biodefense and public health pathogens, and their host responses in the postgenomic era, will require novel bioinformatic techniques. These computational approaches will allow a more complete and thorough understanding of infection and pathogenesis, and greatly facilitate rational vaccine design. This review describes some of these methods and how they can be used in the development of novel vaccines against biothreat viruses."
Dynamics of translation by single ribosomes through mRNA secondary structures,"During protein synthesis, the ribosome translates nucleotide triplets in single-stranded mRNA into polypeptide sequences. Strong downstream mRNA secondary (2°) structures, which must be unfolded for translation, can slow or even halt protein synthesis. Here we employ single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine reaction rates for specific steps within the elongation cycle as the Escherichia coli ribosome encounters stem loop or pseudoknot mRNA 2° structures. Downstream stem-loops containing 100% G-C base pairs decrease the rates of both tRNA translocation within the ribosome and deacylated tRNA dissociation from the ribosomal exit (E) site. Downstream stem-loops or pseudoknots containing both G-C and A-U pairs also decrease the rate of tRNA dissociation, but they have little effect on tRNA translocation rate. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, unfolding of mRNA 2° structures is more closely coupled to E-site tRNA dissociation than to tRNA translocation.","Polypeptide elongation by the ribosome proceeds discontinuously 1-3 , with pauses regulating the rhythm of protein synthesis. Translation rates are known to be modulated by mRNA secondary structures downstream of the decoding center. Downstream pseudoknots or stemloops, which have to be unfolded by the ribosome in order to be translated, can slow or even halt protein synthesis. Such pauses have been linked functionally to co-translational protein folding 4 , protein modification, and frame-shifts. Programmed frameshifting 5, 6 , which is often required for viral pathogenicity, is usually associated with 'slippery' oligonucleotide sequences acting in conjunction with pseudoknots 7 . In some cases stem-loops can also induce frameshifting 8, 9 ."
Infectious Diseases of the Upper Respiratory Tract: Implications for Toxicology Studies,"The consequences of adventitious infectious agents upon the interpretation of toxicology studies performed in rats and mice are incompletely understood. Several prevalent murine pathogens cause alterations of the respiratory system that can confuse the assessment of chemically induced airway ixjury. In some instances the pathogenesis ofinfection with these agents has been relatively well studied in the lower respiratory tract. However, there are few well-controlled studies that have examined the upper respiratory region, which result in interpretive problems for toxicologic pathologists. The conduct and interpretation ofboth short-term and chronic rodent bioassays can be compromised by both the clinical and subclinical manifestations of infectious diseases. This paper reviews several important infectious diseases of the upper airway of rats and mice and discusses the potential influence of these conditions on the results of toxicology studies.","The validity and reproducibility of rodent toxicology studies depend, in part, on the interaction of numerous environmental, microbial, and genetic factors. Control of important animal and extrinsic factors forms the basis of laboratory animal science programs in toxicology. Despite numerous advances and sophistication in the field of laboratory animal medicine, adventitious murine microbial agents continue to pose a threat to both shortand long-term studies that use rats and mice."
Factors affecting translation at the programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting site of Cocksfoot mottle virus RNA in vivo,"The ratio between proteins P27 and replicase of Cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV) is regulated via a À1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (À1 PRF). A minimal frameshift signal with a slippery U UUA AAC heptamer and a downstream stem-loop structure was inserted into a dual reporter vector and directed À1 PRF with an efficiency of 14.4 6 1.9% in yeast and 2.4 6 0.7% in bacteria. P27-encoding CfMV sequence flanking the minimal frameshift signal caused $2-fold increase in the À1 PRF efficiencies both in yeast and in bacteria. In addition to the expected fusion proteins, termination products ending putatively at the frameshift site were found in yeast cells. We propose that the amount of premature translation termination from control mRNAs played a role in determining the calculated À1PRF efficiency. Co-expression of CfMV P27 with the dual reporter vector containing the minimal frameshift signal reduced the production of the downstream reporter, whereas replicase co-expression had no pronounced effect. This finding allows us to propose that CfMV protein P27 may influence translation at the frameshift site but the mechanism needs to be elucidated.","The principal mechanism of translation is the accurate decoding of the triplet codon sequences in one reading frame of mRNA. Specific signals built into the mRNA sequences can cause deviations from this rule. Viruses exploit several translational 'recoding' mechanisms, including translational hopping, stop codon readthrough and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [reviewed in (1, 2) ], for regulating the amount of proteins produced from their polyproteins. For positive-stranded RNA viruses, À1 PRF is the prevailing recoding mechanism and an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral proteins. Most viral À1 PRF signals are regulating the production of replication-associated proteins. Depending on the virus, the efficiency of À1 PRF can vary between 1 and 40% (3) , and changes in the efficiency can inhibit virus assembly and replication (4) (5) (6) . Therefore, À1 PRF can be regarded as a potential target for antiviral agents (4, 7) . However, the development of efficient antiviral drugs is still hindered, since little is known about the trans-acting factors and the biophysical parameters affecting the À1 PRF efficiencies. Database searches have identified putative frameshift signals from a substantial number of chromosomally encoded eukaryotic mRNAs (8) . Thus, À1 PRF may also have an impact on the complexity of the proteome of several eukaryotic organisms."
EID podcast Tuberculosis Surveillance and Control in Puerto Rico,"To investigate a cluster of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases in a women-only dormitory in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October 2015, we collected epidemiologic information, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and blood samples from 828 residents during November 2015 and December 2015-January 2016. We found confirmed infection for 19 (8 by reverse transcription PCR and 11 by serologic testing). Infection attack rates varied (2.7%-32.3%) by dormitory building. No deaths occurred. Independent risk factors for infection were direct contact with a confirmed case-patient and sharing a room with a confirmed case-patient; a protective factor was having an air conditioner in the bedroom. For 9 women from whom a second serum sample was collected, antibodies remained detectable at titers >1:20 by pseudoparticle neutralization tests (n = 8) and 90% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (n = 2). In closed high-contact settings, MERS coronavirus was highly infectious and pathogenicity was relatively low.","M iddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV) is a zoonotic virus (1) .

"Recently published papers: pulmonary care, pandemics, and eugenics in surviving sepsis?",CAP = community-acquired pneumonia; CMV = conventional mechanical ventilation; HAP = hospital-acquired pneumonia; HCAP = health-careassociated pneumonia; NIV = non-invasive ventilation; PTC = protected telescoping aspiration; VAP = ventilator-associated pneumonia.,"Health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) refers to a pulmonary infection that develops in individuals recently hospitalised, or undergoing renal replacement therapy or other long-term out-patient care. Over the past few years it has been postulated that this reflects a distinct group of pathogens with consequent implications for therapy and also on outcome. However, no study had looked at the pathogens of both HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and compared them with those of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
Immune responses to rAAV6: the influence of canine parvovirus vaccination and neonatal administration of viral vector,"Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors promote long-term gene transfer in many animal species. Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that is a member of the Parvovirus family. The AAV genome is approximately 5 kb in size and is packaged within an icosahedral capsid that facilitates viral entry into susceptible cells (Schultz and Chamberlain, 2008) . AAV-mediated gene transfer has been successfully demonstrated in numerous large and small animal models of human disease (Arnett et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009) , and recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are thus considered a prime candidate for use in the development of gene replacement strategies. rAAV vectors are limited by their small carrying capacity, but possess several attractive features that are advantageous for use as therapeutic reagents, including a broad range of tissue tropism and lack of pathogenicity (Schultz and Chamberlain, 2008) . Over 12 serotypes and numerous variants of AAV have been identified. Each serotype has demonstrated a unique profile of tissue tropism that can be utilized to develop targeted therapies with enhanced tissue specificity (Zincarelli et al., 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2009) . For example, rAAV2 exhibits a high tropism for liver and has been used to treat hemophilia B via expression of Factor IX (Manno et al., 2006) . rAAV6 has been shown to achieve a high level of transduction in both lung (Halbert et al., 2001 (Halbert et al., , 2007 and striated muscle Gregorevic et al., 2004 Gregorevic et al., , 2006 , and is thus being studied to develop treatments for diseases such as cystic fibrosis (Flotte et al., 2007; Halbert et al., 2007) , α1-antitrypsin deficiency (Halbert et al., 2010) , and the muscular dystrophies (Arnett et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009) ."
Virus Variation Resource -improved response to emergent viral outbreaks,"The Virus Variation Resource is a value-added viral sequence data resource hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The resource is located at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ viruses/variation/ and includes modules for seven viral groups: influenza virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Ebolavirus, MERS coronavirus, Rotavirus A and Zika virus. Each module is supported by pipelines that scan newly released GenBank records, annotate genes and proteins and parse sample descriptors and then map them to controlled vocabulary. These processes in turn support a purpose-built search interface where users can select sequences based on standardized gene, protein and metadata terms. Once sequences are selected, a suite of tools for downloading data, multi-sequence alignment and tree building supports a variety of user directed activities. This manuscript describes a series of features and functionalities recently added to the Virus Variation Resource.","Genome sequences have the potential to define evolutionary relationships, elucidate disease determinants and inform public health policy decisions. The public databases that comprise the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium (INSDC) are an invaluable resource to a variety of genome-related sequence analysis projects (1) . This collaboration between the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute and the DNA Databank of Japan supports free and unrestricted access to stored sequence data that are maintained as part of the scientific record. As nucleotide sequencing efforts extend into the future, the archival INSDC databases will support comparisons between samples collected over generations and provide infrastructure to study the evolution and impact of viruses in real time. Despite this potential, there are fundamental issues with archival databases that can only be resolved through resources that provide enhanced data such as the NCBI Virus Variation Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ viruses/variation/), which is described in this manuscript."
"New Adenovirus in Bats, Germany","We tested 55 deceased vespertilionid bats of 12 species from southern Germany for virus infections. A new adenovirus was isolated from tissue samples of 2 Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats, which represents the only chiropteran virus isolate found in Europe besides lyssavirus (rabies virus). Evidence was found for adenovirus transmission between bats.","S ince the recent discoveries of Ebola virus, Henipavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infections, interest in the role of bats as hosts for pathogens has markedly increased (1) . With the exception of worldwide studies on bat lyssaviruses (2) , most virologic investigations in bats have been limited to a particular zoonotic agent implicated in a geographically localized disease outbreak (3) (4) (5) . In the remaining studies, various medically less important viruses have been discovered in bats in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia (1, 6) . As a result of increasing research efforts regarding bats and infectious diseases in Europe, 2 new virus groups were recently detected, namely beta-and gammaherpesviruses in organ tissue (7) and group I coronaviruses in feces of European vespertilionid bats (8) . However, because all bat species in Europe/Germany are protected by strict regulations, the acquisition of suitable samples for virus isolation is rather challenging in comparison to most other parts of the world."
A Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic affecting animals on domestic livestock farms was reported in South Africa,"The first cases occurred after heavy rainfall, and the virus subsequently spread countrywide. To determine the possible effect of environmental conditions and vaccination on RVF virus transmissibility, we estimated the effective reproduction number (R e ) for the virus over the course of the epidemic by extending the Wallinga and Teunis algorithm with spatial information. Re reached its highest value in mid-February and fell below unity around mid-March, when vaccination coverage was 7.5%-45.7% and vector-suitable environmental conditions were maintained. The epidemic fade-out likely resulted first from the immunization of animals following natural infection or vaccination. The decline in vector-suitable environmental conditions from April onwards and further vaccination helped maintain R e below unity. Increased availability of vaccine use data would enable evaluation of the effect of RVF vaccination campaigns.","by infection with a phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus). The main vectors are specific Aedes and Culex spp. mosquitoes, and primary hosts are sheep, goats, and cattle (1, 2) . RVF epidemics usually occur after heavy rainfalls, which inundate ephemeral wetlands and enable large numbers of Aedes spp. mosquito eggs to hatch; it has been hypothesized that these mosquitoes harbor RFV virus (3) (4) (5) . Virus transmission is sustained in locations with more persistent surface water, which provides suitable breeding conditions for other vectors, such as Culex sp. mosquitoes (6) . RVF epidemics among animal herds cause abortion storms, affecting all stages of pregnancy, and high death rates among neonates. Epidemics among humans often cause influenza-like illness, although severe conditions (e.g., hemorrhagic fever and death) have been reported (1, 2) ."
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Assisted Prediction of Secondary Structure for RNA: Incorporation of Direction-Dependent Chemical Shift Constraints,"Knowledge of RNA structure is necessary to determine structure−function relationships and to facilitate design of potential therapeutics. RNA secondary structure prediction can be improved by applying constraints from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to a dynamic programming algorithm. Imino proton walks from NOESY spectra reveal double-stranded regions. Chemical shifts of protons in GH1, UH3, and UH5 of GU pairs, UH3, UH5, and AH2 of AU pairs, and GH1 of GC pairs were analyzed to identify constraints for the 5′ to 3′ directionality of base pairs in helices. The 5′ to 3′ directionality constraints were incorporated into an NMR-assisted prediction of secondary structure (NAPSS-CS) program. When it was tested on 18 structures, including nine pseudoknots, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were improved relative to those of three unrestrained programs. The prediction accuracy for the pseudoknots improved the most. The program also facilitates assignment of chemical shifts to individual nucleotides, a necessary step for determining three-dimensional structure.","RNA is a central biomolecule involved in many cellular functions, including synthesizing proteins, regulating gene expression, catalyzing reactions, and storing genetic data in many viruses. 1 Therefore, knowledge of RNA structure can lead to the discovery of causes and cures of many diseases. Once sequence is known, the first step in determining RNA structure is defining the secondary structure, i.e., base pairing. This level of structure is used for many applications, including using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine 3D structure, 2−4 designing therapeutics, 5 and providing insights into functional mechanisms 6 and evolution. 7−10 Methods for predicting RNA secondary structure include comparative sequence analysis 7,11−13 and minimization of free energy predicted on the basis of thermodynamic parameters. 14−18 The latter method is ∼70% accurate when predicting secondary structure from a single sequence, 19, 20 but prediction methods that integrate sequence comparison typically give better than 85% average accuracy. 21−26 A pseudoknot is a type of RNA secondary structure in which nucleotides in a loop region pair with nucleotides outside of where the loop was closed. Formally, a pseudoknot occurs if there are two base pairs with indices i paired to j and k paired to l, with positions i < k < j < l. Base pairs forming pseudoknots are the most difficult to predict, and most popular programs do not allow pseudoknots. Pseudoknots, however, have important biological roles. 27−33 The lack of thermodynamic data for pseudoknots compounds the difficulty of accurately predicting them by calculating free energy changes. 34, 35 To improve the accuracy of predicting secondary structure, techniques that employ experimental data have been developed. Chemical mapping constraints 20 and/or restraints 36−38 can be used to identify nucleotides not in Watson−Crick base pairs. NMR constraints identify nucleotides in Watson−Crick and GU pairs. 39 Crystallization of RNA is challenging. 40, 41 Therefore, many RNA 3D structures have been determined by NMR, which also provides insight into dynamics. NMR-Assisted Prediction of Secondary Structure (NAPSS) utilizes NMR-derived constraints in conjunction with a thermodynamic folding algorithm to reduce the potential folding space of an RNA molecule and provide some initial chemical shift assignments. 39 Imino proton 2D NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) is used to identify helices of stacked canonical base pairs. The user enters constraints from sequential imino proton walks into a program that recursively searches for structures containing matching helical walks. For the set of structures in which all constraints are matched, the program refolds unconstrained regions and calculates the folding free energy change of the entire structure. The putative structures are ranked by predicted folding free energy change. The helical walk constraints, however, do not provide any information about the 5′ to 3′ strand direction of the base pair stacks. That is, the directionality of the set of stacks along the sequence is unknown. Thus, NAPSS often identifies a large set of possible structures that satisfy all of the stacking constraints."
Vasoactive neuropeptides in clinical ophthalmology: An association with autoimmune retinopathy?,"The mammalian eye is protected against pathogens and infl ammation in a relatively immune-privileged environment. Stringent mechanisms are activated that regulate external injury, infection, and autoimmunity. The eye contains a variety of cells expressing vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs), and their receptors, located in the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process, and the retina. VNs are important activators of adenylate cyclase, deriving cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Impairment of VN function would arguably impede cAMP production and impede utilization of ATP. Thus VN autoimmunity may be an etiological factor in retinopathy involving perturbations of purinergic signaling. A sound blood supply is necessary for the existence and functional properties of the retina. This paper postulates that impairments in the endothelial barriers and the blood-retinal barrier, as well as certain infl ammatory responses, may arise from disruption to VN function. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors and purinergic modulators may have a role in the treatment of postulated VN autoimmune retinopathy.","Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) that have been shown to exist in the mammalian eye in areas such as the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process, and the retina. 1, 2 An important feature of VN receptors is their ability to activate adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the retina of mammals. 3 VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are important for regulating levels of ATP and cAMP. 4 Additionally, ATP is a vasoactive signal in the microvasculature of the rat retina 5 and cAMP regulates neurological metabolism by infl uencing blood-brain (BBB) and blood-retinal (BRB) barrier permeability, coordination of neuroregulatory pathways, and inducing protection against neuronal apoptosis. However failure to metabolize ATP adequately may result in elevated extracellular ATP levels and set in train perturbations of purinergic signaling initiating signifi cant neuro-and retino-toxicity. 6, 7 PACAP also acts as a neurotransmitter in the retinohypothalamic tract mediating photic regulation of the brain's biological clock 8 and, along with other neuropeptides, is likely to be of signifi cance in other parts of the eye 9 in addition to the retina. Moreover PACAP has protective effects on monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced retinal degeneration 10 and kainic acid retinal degeneration. 11 PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract 12 and PACAP attenuates glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons, 13 which suggests that compromise of this VN would have signifi cant detrimental impact on retinal viability and function."
Evaluating Detection of an Inhalational Anthrax Outbreak Detecting an Inhalational Anthrax Outbreak Emerging Infectious Diseases • www Detecting an Inhalational Anthrax Outbreak Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"Timely detection of an inhalational anthrax outbreak is critical for clinical and public health management. Syndromic surveillance has received considerable investment, but little is known about how it will perform relative to routine clinical case finding for detection of an inhalational anthrax outbreak. We conducted a simulation study to compare clinical case finding with syndromic surveillance for detection of an outbreak of inhalational anthrax. After simulated release of 1 kg of anthrax spores, the proportion of outbreaks detected first by syndromic surveillance was 0.59 at a specificity of 0.9 and 0.28 at a specificity of 0.975. The mean detection benefit of syndromic surveillance was 1.0 day at a specificity of 0.9 and 0.32 days at a specificity of 0.975. When syndromic surveillance was sufficiently sensitive to detect a substantial proportion of outbreaks before clinical case finding, it generated frequent false alarms.","I n the early stage of an inhalational anthrax outbreak, a 1day delay in the initiation of chemoprophylaxis and treatment of exposed persons can result in thousands of additional deaths and millions of dollars of additional expenditures (1, 2) . Thus, timely detection of an inhalational anthrax outbreak is critical. Rapid detection is also important for disease outbreaks that result from other bioterrorism agents and from emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or avian influenza (3) ."
"Foreign Health, Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality of Spain in Barcelona, Delegation of the Spanish Government in Catalonia","The start of the cholera epidemic in Haiti quickly highlighted the necessity of the implementation of an Alert and Response (A&R) System to complement the existing national surveillance system. The national system had been able to detect and confirm the outbreak etiology but required external support to monitor the spread of cholera and coordinate response, because much of the information produced was insufficiently timely for real-time monitoring and directing of a rapid, targeted response. The A&R System was designed by the Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization in collaboration with the Haiti Ministry of Health, and it was based on a network of partners, including any institution, structure, or individual that could identify, verify, and respond to alerts. The defined objectives were to (1) save lives through early detection and treatment of cases and (2) control the spread through early intervention at the community level. The operational structure could be broken down into three principle categories: (1) alert (early warning), (2) verification and assessment of the information, and (3) efficient and timely response in coordination with partners to avoid duplication. Information generated by the A&R System was analyzed and interpreted, and the qualitative information was critical in qualifying the epidemic and defining vulnerable areas, particularly because the national surveillance system reported incomplete data for more than one department. The A&R System detected a number of alerts unrelated to cholera and facilitated rapid access to that information. The sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was shown in May of 2011, when an abnormal increase in alerts coming from several communes in the Sud-Est Department in epidemiological weeks (EWs) 17 and 18 were noted and disseminated network-wide and response activities were implemented. The national cholera surveillance system did not register the increase until EWs 21 and 22, and the information did not become available until EWs 23 and 24, when the peak of cases had already been reached. Although many of the partners reporting alerts during the peak of the cholera epidemic have since left Haiti, the A&R System has continued to function as an Early Warning (EWARN) System, and it continues to be developed with recent activities, such as the distribution of cell phones to enhance alert communication.","On October 21, 2010, cholera was confirmed for the first time in Haiti in over a century. The outbreak spread rapidly through an earthquake-devastated country; in less than one month after initial detection (from October 19 to November 15 of 2010), cholera had spread throughout the ten departments of Haiti and into neighboring Dominican Republic."
Therapeutic vaccination and immunomodulation in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: preclinical studies in the woodchuck,in immunostimulatory strategies by blocking the interaction of the inhibitory programmed death receptor 1 with its ligand in this animal model.,"More than 240 million people worldwide are persistently infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and are at risk of developing chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1] . An effective and affordable therapy to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease is urgently needed. Pegylated interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-a) is recommended for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in the current consensus guidelines of many countries. Compared with conventional recombinant IFN-a, however, pegylated IFN-a alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues does not significantly increase the rate of sustained response [2, 3] . Nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as, entecavir and tenofovir, suppress HBV replication and result in the improvement of liver architecture. However, these agents cannot eradicate HBV genomes from the liver and may further limited by the development increasingly select drug-resistant mutants with prolonged use [4, 5] . Therapy with additional antiviral drugs targeting other steps in the viral life cycle, in combination with immunomodulatory options, might be more beneficial and effective."
Development of Medical Countermeasures to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ONLINE REPORT,"Preclinical development of and research on potential Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) medical countermeasures remain preliminary; advancements are needed before most countermeasures are ready to be tested in human clinical trials. Research priorities include standardization of animal models and virus stocks for studying disease pathogenesis and efficacy of medical countermeasures; development of MERS-CoV diagnostics; improved access to nonhuman primates to support preclinical research; studies to better understand and control MERS-CoV disease, including vaccination studies in camels; and development of a standardized clinical trial protocol. Partnering with clinical trial networks in affected countries to evaluate safety and efficacy of investigational therapeutics will strengthen efforts to identify successful medical countermeasures.","F rom September 2012 through April 27, 2016, a total of 1,728 laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, leading to 624 deaths (36% case-fatality proportion), had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) (1) . Most infections (75%) have been identified in Saudi Arabia (2) . Zoonotic transmission from exposure to MERS-CoV-infected Arabian camels, known as dromedaries, or their raw milk and limited, nonsustained human-to-human transmission have been reported, including large outbreaks in healthcare facilities (3) (4) (5) . The recovery of infectious MERS-CoV in virus cultures of specimens from bed sheets, bedrails, intravenous fluid hangers, and radiograph equipment indicates the potential for fomite transmission of the virus in hospitals providing care for MERS-CoV patients (6) . However, sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented, and some case-patients have no identified source of exposure to MERS-CoV. As of April 2016, a total of 26 countries had reported locally acquired or exported cases from the Arabian Peninsula, including 2 cases in the United States identified during May 2014 in healthcare personnel who became ill after working in Saudi Arabia (7, 8) . A traveler who visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain and then returned to South Korea infected with MERS-CoV in mid-2015 triggered 184 MERS-CoV cases, resulting in 38 deaths in multiple health facilities and 1 additional case in a person who traveled to China (9, 10) ."
Evaluation of Ultra-Microscopic Changes and Proliferation of Apoptotic Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells Induced by Velogenic Strain of Newcastle Disease Virus AF2240,"Aim: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of genus Avulavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Interest of using NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from its ability to kill tumor cells with limited toxicity to normal cells. Methods: In this investigation, the proliferation of brain tumor cell line, glioblastoma multiform (DBTRG.05MG) induced by NDV strain AF2240 was evaluated in-vitro, by using MTT proliferation assay. Furthermore, Cytological observations were studied using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, DNA laddering in agarose gel electrophoresis assay used to detect the mode of cell death and analysis of the cellular DNA content by flowcytometery. Results: MTT proliferation assay, Cytological observations using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show the anti-proliferation effect and apoptogenic features of NDV on DBTRG.05MG. Furthermore, analysis of the cellular DNA content showed that there was a loss of treated cells in all cell cycle phases (G1, S and G2/M) accompanied with increasing in sub-G1 region (apoptosis peak). Conclusion: It could be concluded that NDV strain AF2240 is a potent antitumor agent that induce apoptosis and its cytotoxicity increasing while increasing of time and virus titer.","Brain tumor is formed by abnormal and uncontrolled cell division; it is an abnormal growth of tissue found inside the skull. It can be dangerous because of the importance of the brain and the limited amount of space inside the skull. Most primary brain tumors do not metastasize systemically but spread locally through extensions of infiltrating tumor cells in normal brain. Surgery; radiation and chemotherapy are the current treatments for brain tumor (Henso, 2005; Maher et al., 2001; Stupp et al., 2005; Adam, 2017) ."
"Perceived Threat, Risk Perception, and Efficacy Beliefs Related to SARS and Other (Emerging) Infectious Diseases: Results of an International Survey","Purpose To study the levels of perceived threat, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, and selfefficacy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and eight other diseases in five European and three Asian countries.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza are two examples of recent emerging infectious diseases that may cause severe threats to population health, large economic losses, as well as fear and dread [1, 2] . The behavior of the general population or specific risk groups can play an important role in both the spread and control of infectious diseases. The SARS epidemic showed the impact of worldwide travel on the rapid spread of an epidemic, as well as the possible merits of strict hygiene and quarantine measures in halting that epidemic [3] . In case of an infectious disease pandemic, public health authorities will be dependent on the willingness and ability of the general public to adhere to recommendations regarding personal hygiene, vaccination and/or prophylaxis, quarantine, travel restrictions, or closing down of public buildings such as schools [4, 5] . Compliance with recommended precautionary behaviors is not self-evident [6] . Specific attention to factors influencing behavioral change during outbreaks of infectious diseases is, therefore, necessary."
"Effects of Hand Hygiene Campaigns on Incidence of Laboratory-confirmed Influenza and Absenteeism in Schoolchildren, Cairo, Egypt","To evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive hand hygiene campaign on reducing absenteeism caused by to influenza-like illness (ILI), diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and laboratory-confirmed influenza, we conducted a randomized control trial in 60 elementary schools in Cairo, Egypt. Children in the intervention schools were required to wash hands twice daily, and health messages were provided through entertainment activities; Data were collected on student absenteeism and reasons for illness. School nurses collected nasal swabs from students with ILI, which were tested by using a qualitative diagnostic test for influenza A and B. Compared with results for the control group, in the intervention group, overall absences caused by ILI decreased (reduced 40%, p<0.0001), diarrhea (reduced 30%, p<0.0001), conjunctivitis (reduced 67%, p<0.0001), and laboratory-confirmed influenza (reduced 50%, p<0.0001). An intensive hand hygiene campaign was effective in reducing absenteeism caused by these illnesses.","deaths annually and account for >7% of global deaths (1) . Many ARIs are caused by viruses, including influenza A and B. Influenza viruses circulate in Egypt all year, peaking in winter months (2) . Although influenza is generally self-limiting, each year it causes 3-5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide (3) . The greatest number of excess deaths occur in persons >65 years of age, yet influenza greatly affects schoolage children as well. In addition, schoolchildren play a key role in transmission of influenza during community epidemics (4) . Slowing or preventing transmission of influenza viruses among children may diminish the explosive transmission pattern that often characterizes annual influenza epidemics (5) ."
Sequencing and Computational Approaches to Identification and characterization of Microbial Organisms,"The recent advances in sequencing technologies and computational approaches are propelling scientists ever closer towards complete understanding of human-microbial interactions. The powerful sequencing platforms are rapidly producing huge amounts of nucleotide sequence data which are compiled into huge databases. This sequence data can be retrieved, assembled, and analyzed for identification of microbial pathogens and diagnosis of diseases. In this article, we present a commentary on how the metagenomics incorporated with microarray and new sequencing techniques are helping microbial detection and characterization.","Microbes have evolved to survive in every type of condition on our planet, including human and animal bodies. Although many are not harmful, a few cause life threatening diseases. Traditionally these are identified by culturing in appropriate media and biochemical or serological testing. However, a large number of microbes have yet to be characterized than are known. They play vital roles in all of their ecosystems including animal bodies. 1 In spite of being extremely small, the sheer numbers of microbes living on the planet have large and critical effects on the cycling of nutrients and compounds essential for the survival of all organisms. 2 To survive in so many types of habitats, microbes have evolved a great number of mechanisms to find energy, digest food, and reproduce. These mechanisms are being applied in a number of ways in agriculture, energy production, medicine, and warfare. All this is possible by thousands of protein molecules and the nucleic acid sequences that encode them. 3 Microbes are encountered in all walks of human life. The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system and a few are indeed beneficial. The relationship between microbes and humans is delicate and complex. Ten times as many microbes live on or inside our body as we have cells. The microbes living in our digestive system break down food and produce useful vitamins. The millions of microbes that coat our skin and intestinal lumen form a protective barrier against more dangerous microbes. 4 In spite of the benefits, a relatively small number of microbes are harmful to humans. Many diseases and epidemics are caused by microbes including the plague during the middle Ages, smallpox, AIDS, influenza, food poisoning, and anthrax. These diseases result in severe illness or even death in humans. As scientists learn more about bacteria, fungi and viruses, they are better able to treat and prevent these diseases. Common treatments include antimicrobials which kill bacteria and fungi as well as vaccines that help the body fight off viruses."
Structure and Dynamics of the HIV-1 Frameshift Element RNA Terms of Use,"The HIV-1 ribosomal frameshift element is highly structured, regulates translation of all virally encoded enzymes, and is a promising therapeutic target. The prior model for this motif contains two helices separated by a threenucleotide bulge. Modifications to this model were suggested by SHAPE chemical probing of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome. Novel features of the SHAPE-directed model include alternate helical conformations and a larger, more complex structure. These structural elements also support the presence of a secondary frameshift site within the frameshift domain. Here, we use oligonucleotide-directed structure perturbation, probing in the presence of formamide, and in-virion experiments to examine these models. Our data support a model in which the frameshift domain is anchored by a stable helix outside the conventional domain. Less stable helices within the domain can switch from the SHAPE-predicted to the two-helix conformation. Translational frameshifting assays with frameshift domain mutants support a functional role for the interactions predicted by and specific to the SHAPE-directed model. These results reveal that the HIV-1 frameshift domain is a complex, dynamic structure and underscore the importance of analyzing folding in the context of full-length RNAs.","H IV-1 viral enzymes, including protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase, are generated by cleavage of the precursor polyprotein Gag-Pol. Although the Gag and Pol polyproteins are translated together, the pol gene is encoded in a reading frame offset from the upstream gag reading frame by one nucleotide in the 5′ direction. Consequently, translation of the Gag-Pol fusion protein relies on programmed ribosomal frameshifting that involves translation of the Gag polyprotein followed by a recoding event that shifts the ribosome from the gag to the pol reading frame. 1 Frameshifting requires two key elements: The first is a highly conserved UUUUUUA sequence, termed the slippery sequence, at which the switch in reading frame occurs, 2 and the second is a downstream structural element termed the frameshift stimulatory stem. This downstream structure is thought to pause the ribosome while the A and P sites are occupied by the slippery sequence. Although the precise mechanism is not fully understood, frameshifting occurs with a frequency of 5−10% in cultured HIV-transfected human cells, and the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio appears to be important for viral fitness. 3 The frameshifting process has consequently attracted interest as a target for the development of therapeutic agents. 4, 5 The original model for the downstream structural element was a single stem-loop. 6 A number of refinements and extensions of this model have been proposed that include additional sequence and structures including pseudoknots, 7−9 a triple-stranded RNA species, 10 and two helices. 11 NMR studies performed on 41-and 45-nucleotide (nt) transcripts support the formation of the two-helix model. 12, 13 This conventional two-helix model includes the originally proposed stem (now termed the upper stem) and a lower stem that is separated from the upper stem by a three-purine bulge ( Figure 1 ). The functional importance of this lower stem is supported by experiments demonstrating decreased frameshifting when the lower stem is destabilized by mutation 11 or when a truncated construct containing only the upper stem is used. 14 An alternative, more complex model was proposed based on SHAPE chemical probing experiments performed on an entire HIV-1 genome. 15 SHAPE probing yields a model-free measurement of local nucleotide flexibility that, in turn, provides nucleotide-resolution information about RNA secondary and tertiary structure. 16 SHAPE reactivities can be incorporated into thermodynamics-based folding algorithms 17 resulting in highly accurate RNA secondary structure models. 18, 19 The SHAPE-directed model of the frameshift domain includes five helices ( Figure 1 ). One is equivalent to the upper stem of the two-helix model. One of the additional helices involves refolding of the lower stem of the conventional model into a helix we term the alternate lower stem. SHAPE data also support the formation of three helices outside the domain traditionally identified as the frameshift stimulatory element. These include a helix that sequesters most of the slippery sequence in base-pairing interactions and a 10-bp anchoring helix. Finally, low SHAPE reactivity at a 3-nt strand between the alternate lower stem and anchoring helix supports an additional short secondary structure, which we currently model as a 3-bp helix. SHAPE data suggest that the frameshift domain spans 140 nts, a significantly larger region than is included in the two-helix model ( Figure 1 )."
Human coronavirus NL63 infections in infants hospitalised with acute respiratory tract infections in South Africa,Background Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a novel respiratory virus which is associated with respiratory tract infections in children.,"A number of respiratory viruses including influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV) play an important role in acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in children. Infections with these viruses may often lead to hospitalisation. However, in a substantial portion of respiratory infections the aetiological agent is not known. There has been renewed interest in human coronaviruses (HCoV) as a cause of some of these infections."
In silico modification of oseltamivir as neuraminidase inhibitor of influenza A virus subtype H1N1,"This research focused on the modification of the functional groups of oseltamivir as neuraminidase inhibitor against influenza A virus subtype H1N1. Interactions of three of the best ligands were evaluated in the hydrated state using molecular dynamics simulation at two different temperatures. The docking result showed that AD3BF2D ligand (N-[(1S,6R)-5-amino-5-{[(2R,3S,4S)-3,4-dihydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran-2yl]oxy}-4-formylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl]acetamide-3-(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate) had better binding energy values than standard oseltamivir. AD3BF2D had several interactions, including hydrogen bonds, with the residues in the catalytic site of neuraminidase as identified by molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that AD3BF2D ligand can be used as a good candidate for neuraminidase inhibitor to cope with influenza A virus subtype H1N1.","Neuraminidase has become the main target for drug design against influenza virus due to its highly conserved catalytic site and its essential role in influenza virus replication [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug against neuraminidase that is useful for preventing viral replication in the last stage of the viral live cycle [6] . It directly interacts with the catalytic residues of the neuraminidase catalytic site, while the framework residues stabilize the enzyme structure [7] . Resistance to oseltamivir has already become a widespread phenomenon, and prediction of the neuraminidase structure shows that the resistance could be several times higher than resistance to zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor [8, 9] . Mutations at the conserved residues of neuraminidase appear to associate with oseltamivir resistance in a subtype specific manner [6] . Arg292Lys, Asn294Ser, and His274Tyr are three known types of mutations that manifest oseltamivir resistance in H1N1 influenza virus [1, [9] [10] [11] . The frequency of His274Tyr mutant viruses is 64%, although it varies among different countries [9, 12] . A high prevalence of the mutant virus is seen in South Africa, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Australia [13] , modest in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, but insignificant in Macau and Taiwan [12] . The search for effective drugs that can cope with H1N1 is still ongoing. Li et al. searched zinc fragment database and found the lead compound of Neo6 as a feasible drug candidate [14] . Drug resistance tendecy of oseltamivir towards H5N1 provided valuable data for H1N1 drug design [1, 11] . Six analog inhibitors as drug candidates against H5N1 were suggested by Du et al. [15] . A more robust binding energy than that of zanamivir and oseltamivir was found in compound AG7088 and its derivatives [16, 17] . Oseltamivir has good bioavaibility and is effective for treatment and prevention of epidemic influenza infection in adults, adolescents and children (> one year of age) [18] . Modifcation of oseltamivir to cope with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 has been attempted [1, 11] , which is based on the properties of amino acid residues in the catalytic site of neuraminidase [19] . Drug-target interactions are being investigated using structural bioinformatics tools [20, 21] . In this study, we focused on the modification of the oseltamivir functional groups and molecular docking was performed to determine the best candidate ligand based on the lowest binding energy and interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation is a useful theoretical tool for analyzing the proteinligand interactions with atomic resolutions based on classical mechanics [22] [23] [24] [25] . We also carried out molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate the interaction of candidate ligands and the enzyme in the hydrated state at two different temperatures."
Microbiological Safety of Drinking Water: United States and Global Perspectives,"Waterborne disease statistics only begin to estimate the global burden of infectious diseases from contaminated drinking water. Diarrheal disease is dramatically underreported and etiologies seldom diagnosed. This review examines available data on waterbome disease incidence both in the United States and globally together with its limitations. The waterborne route of transmission is examined for bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens that either are frequently associated with drinking water (e.g., Shigella spp.), or for which there is strong evidence implicating the waterbome route of transmission (e.g., Leptospira spp.). In addition, crucial areas of research are discussed, including risks from selection of treatment-resistant pathogens, importance of environmental reservoirs, and new methodologies for pathogen-specific monitoring. To accurately assess risks from waterborne disease, it is necessary to understand pathogen distribution and survival strategies within water distribution systems and to apply methodologies that can detect not only the presence, but also the viability and infectivity of the pathogen. -Environ Health Perspect107(Suppl 1): 191-206 (1999). http://ehpnetl.niehs.nih.gov/ docs/1999/Suppl 1/191-206ford/abstract htrl","In many countries, microbiologically safe drinking water is considered a fundamental human right, but the definition of microbiologically safe is undear.

We evaluate global improvements in the timeliness of outbreak discovery and communication during 2010-2014 as a follow-up to a 2010 report. For all outbreaks reported by the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News, we estimate the number of days from first symptoms until outbreak discovery and until first public communication. We report median discovery and communication delays overall, by region, and by Human Development Index (HDI) quartile. We use Cox proportional hazards regression to assess changes in these 2 outcomes over time, along with Loess curves for visualization. Improvement since 1996 was greatest in the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions and in countries in the middle HDI quartiles. However, little progress has occurred since 2010.

The crazy-paving pattern: a radiological-pathological correlation,"The crazy-paving pattern is a linear pattern superimposed on a background of ground-glass opacity, resembling irregularly shaped paving stones. The crazypaving pattern is initially described as the pathognomonic sign of alveolar proteinosis. Nowadays this pattern is a common finding on high-resolution CT imaging, and can be seen in a number of acute and chronic diseases. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate different diseases that cause this crazy-paving pattern and to correlate the radiological findings from computed tomography with the histopathological findings.","The superimposition of a linear pattern on ground-glass opacity on computed tomography images results in a pattern that is termed crazy-paving pattern, resembling the structure of irregularly shaped paving stones [1, 2] . The crazy-paving pattern is a common finding on thin-section computed tomography (HRCT), but also on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Ground-glass opacity is defined as a hazy increase in lung density with preservation of airway and vessel margins [3] . Ground-glass opacity occurs when there is a mild decrease in the amount of air in the airspaces and a filling of the airspaces with fluid, cells or other material, thickening of the alveolar walls or thickening of the interstitium. The linear component of this pattern can be caused by a thickening of the interlobular septa (septal lines), a thickening of the intralobular septa and the intralobular interstitium (intralobular reticular pattern and intralobular branching lines) or a linear deposition of material within the airspaces at the borders of the acini (periacinar pattern) ( Fig. 1 ) [4] . The crazypaving pattern was initially described as a pathognomonic sign of alveolar proteinosis; however, nowadays, this pattern has been reported in a variety of acute and chronic diseases as summarised in Table 1 [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] . The purpose of this paper is to illustrate different diseases showing a crazypaving pattern. The diagnosis is made based on clinical or on histological findings. If histopathological proof is available, a radiological-histopathological correlation is made."
A Versatile PDMS/Paper Hybrid Microfluidic Platform for Sensitive Infectious Disease Diagnosis,"Bacterial meningitis is a serious health concern worldwide. Given that meningitis can be fatal and many meningitis cases occurred in high-poverty areas, a simple, lowcost, highly sensitive method is in great need for immediate and early diagnosis of meningitis. Herein, we report a versatile and cost-effective polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper hybrid microfluidic device integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the rapid, sensitive, and instrumentfree detection of the main meningitis-causing bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis). The introduction of paper into the microfluidic device for LAMP reactions enables stable test results over a much longer period of time than a paper-free microfluidic system. This hybrid system also offers versatile functions, by providing not only on-site qualitative diagnostic analysis (i.e., a yes or no answer), but also confirmatory testing and quantitative analysis in laboratory settings. The limit of detection of N. meningitidis is about 3 copies per LAMP zone within 45 min, close to single-bacterium detection sensitivity. In addition, we have achieved simple pathogenic microorganism detection without a laborious sample preparation process and without the use of centrifuges. This low-cost hybrid microfluidic system provides a simple and highly sensitive approach for fast instrument-free diagnosis of N. meningitidis in resource-limited settings. This versatile PDMS/paper microfluidic platform has great potential for the point of care (POC) diagnosis of a wide range of infectious diseases, especially for developing nations.","T he emergence of 335 infectious diseases that have been reported between 1940 and 2004 in the global human population has generated an extremely significant impact on global health and economies. 1,2 Among various global infectious diseases, epidemic bacterial meningitis, a severe infection affecting the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord known as the meninges, is one of the most dangerous diseases due to its high morbidity and mortality. Meningitis is a contagious disease, which can become fatal in as early as 24 h after symptoms are noticed. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Worldwide, without epidemics one million cases of bacterial meningitis are estimated to occur and 200 000 of these die annually... Higher case-fatality rates (37−60%) have been reported in developing countries."" 3 Additionally, many meningitis cases occurred in rural high-poverty areas, such as the so-called ""meningitis belt"" in Africa, where it remains an important and unresolved public health concern. Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), the etiologic agent of the meningococcal disease, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults worldwide. 4, 5 N. meningitidis is also the dominant etiologic bacterium in the African meningitis belt according to the bacteriologic and epidemiologic data collected over the past 30 years. 6 Usually patients with meningitis share symptoms common to many febrile illnesses (e.g., influenza), which makes meningitis difficult to diagnose based on clinical symptoms alone. Because of the high fatality rate and damaging effects resulting from untreated meningitis in rural high-poverty areas, a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive methodology is in great need for the immediate and early diagnosis of meningitis."
,"Human noroviruses are the predominant cause of foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide. Strains of norovirus also exist that are uniquely associated with animals; their contribution to the incidence of human illness remains unclear. We tested animal fecal samples and identifi ed GIII (bovine), GII.18 (swine), and GII.4 (human) norovirus sequences, demonstrating for the fi rst time, to our knowledge, that GII.4-like strains can be present in livestock. In addition, we detected GII.4-like noroviral RNA from a retail meat sample. This fi nding highlights a possible route for indirect zoonotic transmission of noroviruses through the food chain.","NoVs (22) . Thus, a cow co-infected with both bovine and human strains of NoV could conceivably produce a recombinant virus with altered virulence properties."
CDC Support for Global Public Health Emergency Management RESPOND,"Recent pandemics and rapidly spreading outbreaks of infectious diseases have illustrated the interconnectedness of the world and the importance of improving the international community's ability to effectively respond. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), building on a strong foundation of lessons learned through previous emergencies, international recognition, and human and technical expertise, has aspired to support nations around the world to strengthen their public health emergency management (PHEM) capacity. PHEM principles streamline coordination and collaboration in responding to infectious disease outbreaks, which align with the core capacities outlined in the International Health Regulations 2005. CDC supports PHEM by providing in-country technical assistance, aiding the development of plans and procedures, and providing fellowship opportunities for public health emergency managers. To this end, CDC partners with US agencies, international partners, and multilateral organizations to support nations around the world to reduce illness and death from outbreaks of infectious diseases.","R ecent public health events, such as the 2016 Zika outbreak and 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, have illustrated the interconnectedness of the world and the importance of global health security. Outbreaks of new and highly infectious diseases that start in remote parts of the world can quickly spread to large, urban populations. When Ebola virus disease appeared in Nigeria in 2014, what could have been an explosion of cases was quickly contained, in part because of prior emergency management investment by the government of Nigeria, with assistance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations. Nigeria's ability to use public health emergency management (PHEM) principles to rapidly detect and respond proved invaluable in quickly and effectively stopping the spread of Ebola throughout the country and illustrates the effect of a strong PHEM program (1, 2) ."
First evidence of a pro-infl ammatory response to severe infection with infl uenza virus H1N1 CO M M E N TA RY,"In a recent article for Critical Care, Bermejo-Martin and colleagues [1] describe Th 1 and Th 17 hypercytokinemia as an early signatur e host response to severe infection by the pandemic variant of the infl uenza virus (nvH1N1). Th e nvH1N1 infection is usually self-limiting in nature, but some patients develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization [2] . Th e host immune response may play an important role in poor outcomes after infection. Th e human host immune response to nvH1N1 infection is unknown at this time and studies on its contribution to disease pathogenesis are desperately needed to improve prevention and treatment strategies.","By analyzing 29 cytokines and chemokines and the hemagglutination inhibition activity, Bermejo-Martin and colleagues [1] assessed the early host innate and adaptive immune responses in patients both mildly and severely infected with nvH1N1. While infection with nvH1N1 induces a typical innate response in both mild and severe cases, severe infections with respiratory involvement are characterized by an early secretion of Th 17 and Th 1 cytokines. Th us, hospitalized patients tend to show high systemic levels of mediators that stimulate Th 17 (IL-8, IL-9, IL-17, IL-6) and Th 1 responses (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-15, IL-12p70) [1] . Based on this fi nding, this study was able to highlight similarities between the cytokine response to severe H1N1 infection and the pathogenesis of asthma and some autoimmune diseases."
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,Vol. 62 / No. 20 401,"As part of ongoing efforts by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to enhance disease surveillance, a retrospective epidemiologic study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness for influenza surveillance of data on changes in the volume of prescriptions for antiviral medications. The weekly numbers of dispensed prescriptions for the antiviral medications oseltamivir and zanamivir, as a proportion of all dispensed prescriptions, were compared with the numbers of confirmed laboratory reports of influenza A(H1N1) at the local health authority level in Ontario, Canada, during the second wave of the outbreak of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in 2009. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrated that antiviral prescription dispensing dates were a reasonable proxy for influenza A(H1N1) onset dates at the local health authority level. This report describes the results of those analyses, which indicated that 1) antiviral prescription proportions increased in advance of laboratory reports of influenza and 2) antiviral dispensing data can be available in near real-time. These findings suggest that pharmacy prescription data can provide timely intelligence to help characterize local influenza activity."
Access to,"Proteomics is the large-scale study of the structure and function of proteins in complex biological sample. Such an approach has the potential value to understand the complex nature of the organism. Current proteomic tools allow large-scale, highthroughput analyses for the detection, identification, and functional investigation of proteome. Advances in protein fractionation and labeling techniques have improved protein identification to include the least abundant proteins. In addition, proteomics has been complemented by the analysis of posttranslational modifications and techniques for the quantitative comparison of different proteomes. However, the major limitation of proteomic investigations remains the complexity of biological structures and physiological processes, rendering the path of exploration paved with various difficulties and pitfalls. The quantity of data that is acquired with new techniques places new challenges on data processing and analysis. This article provides a brief overview of currently available proteomic techniques and their applications, followed by detailed description of advantages and technical challenges. Some solutions to circumvent technical difficulties are proposed.","The term proteomics describes the study and characterization of complete set of proteins present in a cell, organ, or organism at a given time [1] . In general, proteomic approaches can be used (a) for proteome profiling, (b) for comparative expression analysis of two or more protein samples, (c) for the localization and identification of posttranslational modifications, and (d) for the study of protein-protein interactions. The human genome harbors 26000-31000 protein encoding genes [2] ; whereas the total number of human protein products, including splice variants and essential posttranslational modifications (PTMs), has been estimated to be close to one million [3, 4] . It is evident that most of the functional information on the genes resides in the proteome, which is the sum of multiple dynamic processes that include protein phosphorylation, protein trafficking, localization, and protein-protein interactions [5] . Moreover, the proteomes of mammalian cells, tissues, and body fluids are complex and display a wide dynamic range of proteins concentration one cell can contain between one and more than 100000 copies of a single protein [6] . In spite of new technologies, analysis of complex biological mixtures, ability to quantify separated protein species, sufficient sensitivity for proteins of low abundance, quantification over a wide dynamic range, ability to analyze protein complexes, and high throughput applications is not yet fulfilled [7] . Biomarker discovery remains a very challenging task due to the complexity of the samples (e.g., serum, other bodily fluids, or tissues) and the wide dynamic range of protein concentrations [8] . Most of the serum biomarker studies performed to date seem to have converged on a set of proteins that are repeatedly identified in many studies and that represent only a small fraction of the entire blood proteome [9] . Processing and analysis of proteomics data is indeed a very complex multistep process [10, 11] . The consistent and transparent analysis of LC/MS and LC-MS/MS data requires multiple stages [12] , and this process remains the main bottleneck for many larger proteomics studies. To overcome these issues, effective sample preparation (to reduce complexity and to enrich for lower abundance components while depleting the most abundant ones), state-of-the-art mass spectrometry instrumentation, and extensive data processing and data analysis are required. A wide range of proteomic approaches are available such as gel-based applications include one-dimensional and twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [13, 14] , and gel-free high throughput screening technologies are equally available, including multidimensional protein identification technology [15] , isotope-coded affinity tag ICAT [16] ; SILAC [17] ; isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) [18] . Shotgun proteomics [19] and 2DE DIGE [20] as well as protein microarrays [21, 22] are applied to obtain overviews of protein expression in tissues, cells, and organelles. Large-scale western blot assays [23] , multiple reaction monitoring assay (MRM) [24] , and label-free quantification of high mass resolution LC-MS data [25] are being explored for high throughput analysis. Many different bioinformatics tools have been developed to aid research in this field such as optimizing the storage and accessibility of proteomic data or statistically ascertaining the significance of protein identifications made from a single peptide match [26] . In this review we attempt to provide a overview of the major developments in the field of proteomics, some success stories as well as challenges that are currently being faced."
Generation of stable monoclonal antibody-producing BCR + human memory B cells by genetic programming,"B cell lymphoma (BCL)6 and Bcl-xL are expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells and enable them to endure the proliferative and mutagenic environment of the GC. By introducing these genes into peripheral blood memory B cells and culturing these cells with factors produced by follicular helper T cells, CD40L and IL-21, we convert them to highly proliferating, cell surface BCR positive, Ig-secreting B cells with features of GC B cells including expression of activationinduced cytidine deaminase. We generated cloned lines of B cells specific for respiratory syncytial virus and used these cells as a source of antibodies that effectively neutralized this virus in vivo. This method provides a new tool to study GC B cell biology, signal transduction through antigenspecific B cell receptors, and for the rapid generation of high affinity human monoclonal antibodies.","Stable monoclonal cell lines of immortalized human B cells that express the B cell receptor (BCR) on their cell surface while secreting antibodies would be attractive tools for studying various aspects of BCR signaling but also for the generation of human monoclonal antibodies. BCR expression on polyclonal immortalized human B cells would facilitate selection of antigen-specific cells on basis of binding of antigen to the specific BCR, while production of antibodies enables selection of B cell clones on the basis of functional activities of the secreted antibodies. While naïve and memory B cells express cell surface BCR, they do not secrete Ig. Cells that simultaneously express the BCR and secrete antibodies might be present in the light zone of the germinal center (GC). These cells may represent plasmablasts ready to be selected into the plasma cell compartment 1."
"Enterovirus D68 Infection in Children with Acute Flaccid Myelitis, Colorado, USA, 2014","a total of 11 children with acute flaccid myelitis and distinctive neuroimaging changes were identified near Denver, Colorado, USA. A respiratory prodrome was experienced by 10, and nasopharyngeal specimens were positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) for 4. To determine whether an association exists between EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis, we conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing these patients with 2 groups of outpatient control children (1 group tested for acute respiratory illness and 1 for Bordetella pertussis infection). Adjusted analyses indicated that, for children with acute flaccid myelitis, the odds of having EV-D68 infection were 10.3 times greater than for those tested for acute respiratory infection and 4.5 times greater than for those tested for B. pertussis infection. No statistical association was seen between acute flaccid myelitis and non-EV-D68 enterovirus or rhinovirus infection. These findings support an association between EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis.","E nterovirus D68 (EV-D68) shares features with rhinoviruses (1) and primarily causes respiratory disease. Clusters of respiratory disease caused by EV-D68 have been reported in Asia, Europe, and the United States (2, 3) . Although EV-D68 has been identified in the central nervous system of 2 patients with limb weakness (4, 5) , its role in causing neuroinvasive disease has not been clearly defined."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Clinical Outcome and Prognostic Correlates,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) poses a major threat to the health of people worldwide. We performed a retrospective case series analysis to assess clinical outcome and identify pretreatment prognostic correlates of SARS, managed under a standardized treatment protocol. We studied 127 male and 196 female patients with a mean age of 41±14 (range 18-83). All patients, except two, received ribavirin and steroid combination therapy. In 115 (36%) patients, the course of disease was limited. Pneumonitis progressed rapidly in the remaining patients. Sixty-seven (21%) patients required intensive care, and 42 (13%) required ventilator support. Advanced age, high admission neutrophil count, and high initial lactate dehydrogenase level were independent correlates of an adverse clinical outcome. SARS-associated coronavirus caused severe illnesses in most patients, despite early treatment with ribavirin and steroid. This study has identified three independent pretreatment prognostic correlates.","T he outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong was caused by a novel virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae (1, 2) . The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, direct contact with fomites, and aerosolized respiratory secretions (3, 4) . The first outbreak was linked to an index patient treated in the Prince of Wales Hospital (4) . The second wave of spread in the community was started by an infected patient with renal disease and amplified by the sewage system of Amoy Gardens, a densely populated condominium in Hong Kong (5) . The floor drain traps in many apartments of Amoy Gardens were not filled with water and thus lost the sealing function. Therefore, the bathrooms of many apartments were openly connected with the soil stack. Virus-loaded droplets of an affected apartment could have been spread through the floor drain system. Hundreds of patients were then treated in public hospitals. The virus was highly contagious and caused substantial illness and death among the general population as well as among healthcare workers."
Membrane Interacting Regions of Dengue Virus NS2A Protein Terms of Use,"The Dengue virus (DENV) NS2A protein, essential for viral replication, is a poorly characterized membrane protein. NS2A displays both protein/protein and membrane/protein interactions, yet neither its functions in the viral cycle nor its active regions are known with certainty. To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this protein's full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior. Following this initial screening, one region, peptide dens25, had interesting effects on membranes; therefore, we sought to thoroughly characterize this region's interaction with membranes. This peptide presents an interfacial/hydrophobic pattern characteristic of a membrane-proximal segment. We show that dens25 strongly interacts with membranes that contain a large proportion of lipid molecules with a formal negative charge, and that this effect has a major electrostatic contribution. Considering its membrane modulating capabilities, this region might be involved in membrane rearrangements and thus be important for the viral cycle.","There are three genera in Flaviviridae, Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, and Pestivirus. 1 Dengue virus (DENV) and several other highly pathogenic viruses like the Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) or the Yellow Fever virus (YFV) are part of the Flavivirus genus. For the best part of the last century, Dengue virus has been the most prevalent arbovirus affecting the human population. Once restricted to the tropics and subtropics, it is now spreading to previously unaffected zones, owing to the dispersion of its vectors, Aedes spp., driven by several factors, among them an ever-increasing global temperature and widespread traveling. Apart from that, the fact that the last year there were over 390 million estimated cases, 2 DENV is becoming a serious threat to public health. Although the most common clinical manifestations are asymptomatic or mild fevers that can be tackled with well-equipped hospitals, there are two other serious life threatening situations with mortality rates surpassing 20% if left unattended. 3 The fact that more than 40% of the world population lives in regions where Dengue vectors thrive, leaving close to 3 billion people at risk in the world, should not be overlooked. 4 Although several compounds have been identified to inhibit DENV replication, 5 there is actually no clinical treatment for its infection."
Increased Flavonoid Compounds from Fermented Houttuynia cordata using Isolated Six of Bacillus from Traditionally Fermented Houttuynia cordata,"Flavonoids, which form a major component in Houttuynia cordata Thunb., display a wide range of pharmacological activities. The expression of plant flavonoids is partly regulated by fermentation. Therefore, we studied the effects of fermentation on H. cordata in order to identify the strains present during the fermentation process, and to determine whether fermented H. cordata could be used as a probiotic. Our results showed that all 6 of the bacterial strains isolated from fermented H. cordata (FHC) belonged to the genus Bacillus. As expected, fermenting H cordata also increased the flavonoid content as increases were observed in the levels of rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin. To test the effects of fermentation, we treated LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with non-fermented H. cordata extracts (HCE) or FHC extracts (FHCE). Compared to the HCE-treated cells, the FHCE-treated cells showed increased viability. No cytotoxic effects were detected in the FHCE-treated groups in the 2 cell lines used in the study, namely, RAW264.7 and RBL-2H3. FHCE-treated HepG2 cells showed decreased growth, compared to HCE-treated HepG2 cells. These results indicate that the fermented H. cordata predominantly contained Bacillus strains. Furthermore, FHCE are able to prevent LPS-induced inflammatory effects and inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells.","The interest in finding natural sources of antioxidants, in particular, of plant origin, has witnessed a recent upsurge. Numerous crude extracts and purified natural compounds from plants have antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities (Fardet et al., 2008; Niki, 2010; Tian et al., 2011) . Lowmolecular weight compounds such as vitamins, zeaxanthin, and flavonoids are considered the active ingredients in plants (Beker et al., 2011) . Flavonols such as quercetin and morin act as chain-breaking antioxidants in cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles by inhibiting linoleic acid autoxidation (He et al., 2012) ."
,"We identified unusual rotavirus strains in fecal specimens from sheltered dogs in Hungary by viral metagenomics. The novel rotavirus species displayed limited genome sequence homology to representatives of the 8 rotavirus species, A-H, and qualifies as a candidate new rotavirus species that we tentatively named Rotavirus I.","R otaviruses (family Reoviridae, genus Rotavirus) are major causes of acute dehydrating gastroenteritis in birds and mammals (1) . Rotaviruses have an 11-segmented dsRNA genome encoding 6 structural proteins (viral protein [VP] 1-4, VP6, and VP7) and at least 5 functional nonstructural proteins (NSPs; NSP1-NSP5) (online Technical Appendix Table 1 , http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/21/4/14-1370-Techapp1.pdf). Traditionally, rotaviruses have been classified into (sero)groups on the basis of major antigenic differences that predominantly reside in the VP6 and of the genomic RNA profile obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (1) . Recently, a VP6 gene sequence-based classification scheme has been proposed to replace the conventional methods. An empirical 53% aa identity was demonstrated to reliably distinguish strains of various rotavirus groups (2) . Also, reclassification of the 8 rotavirus groups as distinct species within the Rotavirus genus, designated Rotavirus A-H, has been proposed."

PERSPECTIVE 1002 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"The global trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms that not only cause human disease outbreaks but also threaten livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and the health of ecosystems. Outbreaks resulting from wildlife trade have caused hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage globally. Rather than attempting to eradicate pathogens or the wild species that may harbor them, a practical approach would include decreasing the contact rate among species, including humans, at the interface created by the wildlife trade. Since wildlife marketing functions as a system of scale-free networks with major hubs, these points provide control opportunities to maximize the effects of regulatory efforts.","T hreats to global health and risk factors for emerging infectious diseases run the gamut from climate change to poverty to security issues, but few are as immediately manageable as the global trade in wildlife. Trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms at levels that not only cause human disease outbreaks but also threaten livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and the health of ecosystems. Quantifying the global wildlife trade is almost impossible since it ranges in scale from local barter to major international routes, and much is conducted illegally or through informal networks. Some estimates indicate that ≈40,000 live primates, 4 million live birds, 640,000 live reptiles, and 350 million live tropical fish are traded globally each year (1) . Live wildlife in markets in Guangzhou, China, trade in masked palm civets, ferret badgers, barking deer, wild boars, hedgehogs, foxes, squirrels, bamboo rats, gerbils, various species of snakes, and endangered leopard cats, along with domestic dogs, cats, and rabbits (2) . After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, 838,500 wild animals were reportedly confiscated from the markets in Guangzhou (3). Wild mammals, birds, and reptiles flow daily through trading centers, where they are in contact with persons and with dozens of other species before they are shipped to other markets, sold locally, or even freed and sent back into the wild as part of religious customs such as merit release (4) or because they become unwanted pets. In a single market in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, up to 90,000 mammals are sold per year (5) . In a survey conducted at 1 market in Thailand for 25 weekends, >70,000 birds, representing of 276 species, were sold (6). A similar survey of 4 markets in Bangkok in 2001 found that of 36,537 observed birds; only 37% were native to Thailand, while 63% were nonnative species (7) ."
An Informatics Solution for Informing Care Delivery of Immediate Public Health Risks to Their Patients An Informatics Solution for Informing Care Delivery of Immediate Public Health Risks to Their Patients,"This paper describes a public health alerting approach that has the potential to improve patient care during a public health outbreak and reduce healthcare costs, streamline the process of public health alert management and dissemination, and heighten the crucial feedback loop between public health officials and clinicians. The approach ties public health alerts into the diagnostic process and allows clinicians to more easily determine when an observed medical condition may be related to a more widespread disease outbreak. A prototype Alert Knowledge Repository (AKR) service using this approach was demonstrated within the Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) interoperability showcases in April and September 2009, respectively.","Over the past several years, new public health risks have become increasingly visible in the news media. When the West Nile virus was introduced to the United States in 1999, there was little experience in U.S. healthcare communities with this virus, which can cause a severe neuroinvasive disease in about 20 percent of those infected [1] . Beginning in February 2003, a communicable respiratory disease known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), later found to be caused by a previously unknown coronavirus, rapidly spread from China to 37 countries [2] in a matter of months, resulting in 8,098 known cases and 774 deaths. In the summer of 2008, peppers containing Salmonella serotype Saintpaul caused the largest recorded food borne outbreak in the United States [3] . In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the spread of a novel H1N1 variety of influenza had reached Phase 6 pandemic levels [4] . These new and emerging diseases pose widespread public health risks and highlight the need for closer communications between health care providers and public health officials responsible for monitoring health risks. This need is greater in an environment where additional demands are being placed on limited public health resources."
Managing public health crises: the role of models in pandemic preparedness,"Background Given the enormity of challenges involved in pandemic preparedness, design and implementation of effective and cost-effective public health policies is a major task that requires an integrated approach through engagement of scientific, administrative, and political communities across disciplines. There is ample evidence to suggest that modeling may be a viable approach to accomplish this task.","Influenza pandemics have historically been devastating to humanity with significant morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic costs. 1 The 1918-1919 pandemic, the so-called ''mother of all pandemics,'' 2 was responsible for over 50 million deaths among countless infections worldwide. Today, 40 years after the last pandemic in 1968, the world may be on the brink of another major global pandemic, with a toll that could exceed that of the 1918-1919 pandemic. 3 While the nature of the next influenza pandemic cannot be predicted with certainty, the identification of strategies to effectively curtail the spread of disease is an unavoidable priority in responding to this global threat. In light of this, the University of Winnipeg hosted a multidisciplinary workshop on the role of models in pandemic preparedness. 4 The workshop brought together public health experts, key decision makers, and infectious disease modelers to: (i) identify the strengths and weaknesses of mathematical models, and suggest ways to improve their predictive ability that will ultimately influence policy effectiveness; and (ii) provide an opportunity for the discussion of priority components of a pandemic plan and determine key parameters that affect policy decision making."
,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established 10 Global Disease Detection (GDD) Program regional centers around the world that serve as centers of excellence for public health research on emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. The core activities of the GDD Program focus on applied public health research, surveillance, laboratory, public health informatics, and technical capacity building. During 2015-2016, program staff conducted 205 discrete projects on a range of topics, including acute respiratory illnesses, health systems strengthening, infectious diseases at the human-animal interface, and emerging infectious diseases. Projects incorporated multiple core activities, with technical capacity building being most prevalent. Collaborating with host countries to implement such projects promotes public health diplomacy. The GDD Program continues to work with countries to strengthen core capacities so that emerging diseases can be detected and stopped faster and closer to the source, thereby enhancing global health security.","I nfectious disease outbreaks present a serious health threat that requires early detection and effective preventive action to avoid regional or even global spread. Such actions enhance global health security by protecting the health of persons in the affected regions and in the United In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established the International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP) to conduct applied public health surveillance and research aimed at preventing infectious disease outbreaks with pandemic potential. IEIP placed CDC staff in key overseas locations to work with national public health institutes and their partners to establish sentinel surveillance and conduct applied research on emerging infectious diseases. The program was modeled after the US-based Emerging Infections Program, a network of state health departments and their partners that conduct surveillance of certain infections and thereby provide a foundation for various epidemiologic studies to explore risk factors, spectrum of disease, and prevention strategies (1) . IEIP had a similar objective but on a global platform; namely, to conduct applied public health research in strategic global locations to prevent, detect, and control emerging and reemerging pathogens."

The principal reservoir of D. repens is the dog. Humans are accidental hosts with patent infections being extremely rare. Differential diagnoses of HSD include neoplasia and other granulomatous diseases, and a definitive diagnosis usually requires surgical removal and examination of a granuloma."
,"We analyzed information obtained from 1,192 patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reported in Hong Kong. Among them, 26.6% were hospital workers, 16.1% were members of the same household as SARS patients and had probable secondary infections, 14.3% were Amoy Gardens residents, 4.9% were inpatients, and 9.9% were contacts of SARS patients who were not family members. The remaining 347 case-patients (29.1%) had undefined sources of infection. Excluding those <16 years of age, 330 patients with cases from ""undefined"" sources were used in a 1:2 matched case-control study. Multivariate analysis of this case-control study showed that having visited mainland China, hospitals, or the Amoy Gardens were risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.95 to 7.63). In addition, frequent mask use in public venues, frequent hand washing, and disinfecting the living quarters were significant protective factors (OR 0.36 to 0.58). In Hong Kong, therefore, community-acquired infection did not make up most transmissions, and public health measures have contributed substantially to the control of the SARS epidemic.",sources of infection have not been reported. Such an initiative would help assess the infectivity and modes of transmission of the virus in the community setting.
Base-By-Base: Single nucleotide-level analysis of whole viral genome alignments,"Background: With ever increasing numbers of closely related virus genomes being sequenced, it has become desirable to be able to compare two genomes at a level more detailed than gene content because two strains of an organism may share the same set of predicted genes but still differ in their pathogenicity profiles. For example, detailed comparison of multiple isolates of the smallpox virus genome (each approximately 200 kb, with 200 genes) is not feasible without new bioinformatics tools.","The recent advances in large-scale DNA sequencing technologies has significantly reduced the cost of this work, and it has become feasible to determine the sequence of multiple isolates of a number of viruses and examine smaller and smaller differences between them. The availability of this type of data permits novel hypotheses to be tested, but it requires new bioinformatics tools. For a number of years, our laboratory has been designing software specifically to manage and analyze large numbers of the bigger virus genomes such as those of poxviruses. Poxvirus genomes range in size from 150-380 kb and encode several hundred proteins [1] ; there are now more than 30 completely sequenced poxvirus genomes available from GenBank. Coronaviruses provide another important example, with the largest genome (~30 kb) of all RNA viruses and 99 isolates of the SARS virus completely sequenced. This wealth of sequence data provides excellent opportunities to study new aspects of virus virulence and evolution. The Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters (POCs; [2] ) mySQL database and query tools, now expanded to Virus Orthologous Clusters (VOCs), was constructed to organize all the genomes of one virus family into a single database and to group orthologous genes into families. A variety of tools are integrated into the database for rapid comparison of not only individual genes and proteins but also entire gene families if required. These tools include BLAST [3, 4] , CLUSTALW [5, 6] , T-coffee [7] , hydrophobicity plots (using Kyte-Doolittle, Hopp-Woods and Parker-Guo-Hodges scales of hydrophobicity), DNA/protein dotplots and NAP [8] to align protein to DNA sequences. Gene maps of complete virus genomes are also generated automatically in VOCs. Continuing on the theme of working with gene families and complete genomes, the Viral Genome Organizer (VGO; [9] ) was designed to display multiple whole genomes in a single working window with zooming capabilities and showing a variety of information such as ORFs, start/stop codons and AT%. VGO acts as a graphical portal to a variety of data that is stored in VOCs (amino acid composition, nucleotide composition, presence of orthologs in other genomes and preprocessed BLAST searches) or generated on-the-fly; for example clicking on gene X in one genome will cause the orthologous gene to be highlighted in a related genome. This software has the ability to easily and quickly answer a database query such as display genes present in variola virus that are absent from vaccinia virus. However, no software existed that could display all nucleotide differences between variola virus strain 1 and variola virus strain 2 and provide a summary of implications of these base changes; therefore the development of Base-By-Base (BBB) was initiated. This level of detail is required by current sequencing projects that aim to identify the genetic determinants responsible for phenotypes such as mortality rate/virulence, host tropism or tissue tropism displayed by different isolates of a single virus species. BBB allows the user to quickly display all nucleotide differences between genomes, and provides a detailed summary of the effect that each change produces in the relevant genes."
Inflammation induced by influenza virus impairs human innate immune control of pneumococcus Europe PMC Funders Group,Colonization of the upper respiratory tract by pneumococcus is important both as a determinant of disease and for transmission into the population. The immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcus during colonization are well studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of pneumococcus following infection with influenza virus is associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia. We used a human challenge model with type 6B pneumococcus to show that acquisition of pneumococcus induced early degranulation of resident neutrophils and recruitment of monocytes to the nose. Monocyte function was associated with the clearance of pneumococcus.,"Pneumonia is a major global health problem; it kills more children under 5 years of age than any other disease 1. The burden of disease is aggravated by old age, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression and viral co-infection. Secondary pneumonia following pandemic and seasonal influenza virus infection is a significant cause of mortality worldwide 2."
Search past issues of EID at www.cdc.gov/eid,"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, associated with a new coronavirus, was reported in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America in early 2003. To address speculations that the virus originated in domesticated animals, or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus, we inoculated 6week-old pigs and chickens intravenously, intranasally, ocularly, and orally with 106 PFU of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Clinical signs did not develop in any animal, nor were gross pathologic changes evident on postmortem examinations. Attempts at virus isolation were unsuccessful; however, viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in blood of both species during the first week after inoculation, and in chicken organs at 2 weeks after inoculation. Virus-neutralizing antibodies developed in the pigs. Our results indicate that these animals do not play a role as amplifying hosts for SARS-CoV.","A n outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, associated with a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has been reported in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America (1) (2) (3) . According to the World Health Organization, SARS affected more than 8,200 people worldwide and killed more than 700. The sequence analysis of SARS-CoV suggests that it is substantially distinct from all other known coronaviruses (1, 2) . Based on the nucleotide sequence, the virus is speculated to have evolved and been maintained in an animal host. However, no conclusive data have been presented to date on a possible reservoir for this virus. Our study aimed to address the role of domestic animals in the outbreak, both from the public health perspective (as a potential source of virus for human infections) and the animal health perspective. A potential susceptibility of domestic species to SARS-CoV would have major implications on the management of livestock operations worldwide."

Duration of Antibody Responses after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"Among 176 patients who had had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-specifi c antibodies were maintained for an average of 2 years, and signifi cant reduction of immunoglobulin G-positive percentage and titers occurred in the third year. Thus, SARS patients might be susceptible to reinfection >3 years after initial exposure.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) represents the fi rst pandemic transmissible disease to emerge in this century. It was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1) . SARS-CoV spreads from animals to humans by a rapid adaptation and evolution process (2, 3) . A large number of closely related viruses are present in wildlife reservoir populations (4) (5) (6) . Therefore, due to cross-species transmission of the same or a similar coronavirus, SARS could recur. Immune protection against infection with other human coronaviruses, such as OC43 and 229E, is short-lived (7) . To assess SARS patients' risk for future reinfection, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunity in convalescent patients."
Detection of Novel SARS-like and Other Coronaviruses in Bats from Kenya,"Diverse coronaviruses have been identifi ed in bats from several continents but not from Africa. We identifi ed group 1 and 2 coronaviruses in bats in Kenya, including SARS-related coronaviruses. The sequence diversity suggests that bats are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of coronaviruses for many species, including humans.","T he 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) generated renewed interest in coronaviruses (CoV) and the source for the SARS CoV that caused the outbreak in humans (1) . Serologic studies demonstrated that the virus had not previously circulated in human populations to any large extent and suggested a source of zoonotic origin (2) (3) (4) . A likely natural viral reservoir for the virus was not identifi ed until horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) in several regions in the People's Republic of China were demonstrated to harbor SARS-like CoVs (5) . Subsequently, a number of other SARS-like CoVs, as well as CoVs from antigenic groups I and II, were identifi ed from bats in Asia, Europe, and North America, and coronavirus antibodies were detected in African bat species (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . It is not surprising that a growing number of CoVs have been detected in bats. To date, >60 viral species have been detected in bats because their biodiversity (second only to rodents), high population densities, wide distribution, and ability to fl y over long distances allow them to harbor and easily spread multiple infectious agents. Bats have long been known as natural hosts for lyssaviruses and more recently have been recognized as potential reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, and Hendra viruses in addition to SARS-CoV (12, 13) ."
Plasmon-Enhanced Fluorescence Biosensors: a Review,"Surfaces of metallic films and metallic nanoparticles can strongly confine electromagnetic field through its coupling to propagating or localized surface plasmons. This interaction is associated with large enhancement of the field intensity and local optical density of states which provides means to increase excitation rate, raise quantum yield, and control far field angular distribution of fluorescence light emitted by organic dyes and quantum dots. Such emitters are commonly used as labels in assays for detection of chemical and biological species. Their interaction with surface plasmons allows amplifying fluorescence signal (brightness) that accompanies molecular binding events by several orders of magnitude. In conjunction with interfacial architectures for the specific capture of target analyte on a metallic surface, plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) that is also referred to as metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) represents an attractive method for shortening detection times and increasing sensitivity of various fluorescence-based analytical technologies. This review provides an introduction to fundamentals of PEF, illustrates current developments in design of metallic nanostructures for efficient fluorescence signal amplification that utilizes propagating and localized surface plasmons, and summarizes current implementations to biosensors for detection of trace amounts of biomarkers, toxins, and pathogens that are relevant to medical diagnostics and food control.","Research in plasmonic confinement of light to volumes much smaller than wavelength paved new routes to powerful amplification schemes in optical spectroscopies. In particular, we witnessed rapid advancements in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (SEIRA), and surface plasmon-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (PEF) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] over the last years. This progress was accompanied with the implementation of plasmonics to a range of analytical technologies for the detection of chemical and biological species that are relevant to important areas of medical diagnostics, food control, and security [6, 7] . Among these, fluorescence is arguably the mostly spread optical method, and it has been already routinely used for readout of assays over several decades. In PEF, fluorophore labels are coupled with the tightly confined field of surface plasmonscollective oscillation of charge density and associated electromagnetic field on a surface of metallic films and nanostructures. This interaction can be engineered to dramatically enhance emitted fluorescence light intensity which is desired for detecting minute amounts of analytes with improved limit of detection and shorten analysis time. PEF was subject to a number of excellent reviews over the last years covering the fundamental research on the interaction of nanoscale emitters with metallic surfaces [8] [9] [10] as well as its implementation into advanced assays and applications for biological studies [4, 5, [11] [12] [13] . This paper aims at updating these reviews and providing key leads for a design of plasmonic nanostructures for efficient amplification on realistic biochips. Firstly, fundamentals of surface plasmon-fluorophore interactions are introduced, and the performance characteristics of metallic nanostructures that are essential for strong enhancement of fluorescence signal are discussed. Afterwards, implementations of PEF biosensor devices for rapid detection of trace amounts of biomarkers and harmful compounds including toxins and pathogens are reviewed."

BMC Public Health Airborne rhinovirus detection and effect of ultraviolet irradiation on detection by a semi-nested RT-PCR assay,"Background: Rhinovirus, the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infections, has been implicated in asthma exacerbations and possibly asthma deaths. Although the method of transmission of rhinoviruses is disputed, several studies have demonstrated that aerosol transmission is a likely method of transmission among adults. As a first step in studies of possible airborne rhinovirus transmission, we developed methods to detect aerosolized rhinovirus by extending existing technology for detecting infectious agents in nasal specimens.","Rhinoviruses have been associated with 40% to 65% of ""common colds"" studied by methods of virus culture [1, 2] . With the use of reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rhinovirus has been shown to be associated with 53% of all colds throughout the year and up to 92% of colds during the autumn outbreak period [3] . Rhinviruses have been implicated in the exacerbation of asthma symptoms [4] and may even play a role in asthma related deaths [5] . Due to their role in the exacerbation of asthma symptoms, rhinoviruses are a major cause of pediatric hospitalizations [6] ."
"PRED BALB/c : a system for the prediction of peptide binding to H2 d molecules, a haplotype of the BALB/c mouse","PRED BALB/c is a computational system that predicts peptides binding to the major histocompatibility complex-2 (H2 d ) of the BALB/c mouse, an important laboratory model organism. The predictions include the complete set of H2 d class I (H2-K d , H2-L d and H2-D d ) and class II (I-E d and I-A d ) molecules. The prediction system utilizes quantitative matrices, which were rigorously validated using experimentally determined binders and non-binders and also by in vivo studies using viral proteins. The prediction performance of PRED BALB/c is of very high accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first online server for the prediction of peptides binding to a complete set of major histocompatibility complex molecules in a model organism (H2 d haplotype). PRED BALB/c is available at http://antigen.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/predBalbc/.","The T cells of the immune system recognize antigens as short peptide fragments (T-cell epitopes) derived from self or foreign proteins. Self proteins include all proteins produced by the cells of the host. Foreign peptides are derived from pathogens, environmental antigens, tumor cells and transplanted tissue. Immune recognition of both self and foreign antigens involves proteolytic processing of antigens, binding of the peptide epitopes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and presentation of selected peptide epitopes on the cell surface to activate of T cells (1) (2) (3) (4) . Cytotoxic T cells (CD8 + ) recognize peptides bound to MHC class I molecules and helper T cells (CD4 + ) recognize antigen in the context of MHC class II molecules. MHC class I molecules are present in all cells and bind mainly endogenous peptides (those produced within the presenting cell), whereas class II molecules are present mainly in cells that recognize foreign proteins, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. T-cell epitopes are critical for the immune response to infectious, autoimmune, allergic and neoplastic disease. They have been studied for the development of peptide-based vaccines (5) and may also be important in the diagnosis of pathogens. It is estimated that between 1 and 5% of all peptides can bind a particular MHC molecule (6) . Traditional approaches to the identification of T-cell epitopes that involve various biochemical and functional assays of overlapping peptides derived from proteins of interest are costly and not applicable to large-scale studies. Accurate predictions using computer models help speed up the identification of T-cell epitopes (7), minimize the number of experiments necessary and enable systematic scanning for candidate T-cell epitopes from larger sets of protein antigens, such as those encoded by complete viral genomes (8) ."
The effect of Allium sativum (Garlic) extract on infectious bronchitis virus in specific pathogen free embryonic egg,"Objective: Garlic is a plant has been used as a flavor, and antimicrobial and anti-diarrheal agent. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus. The available vaccines against IBV cannot cover new variants. This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of garlic extract on IBV. Materials and Methods: The constituents of garlic extract were detected by gas chromatography. This study was done in four groups of embryonic SPF eggs; first group was used for virus titration; second group received the mixture of different virus titration and constant amount of garlic extract; third group received 10 -3 titration of virus and after 8 hr received garlic extract and the last group received different dilutions of garlic extract. Results: Based on our results, in the second group, IBV vaccine strain (4/91) at all titration and M41 in 10 -2 and 10 -3 titration and in the third group both variants of virus the embryonic Index (EI) was significantly increased. Conclusion: The garlic extract had inhibitory effects on IBV in the chickens embryo.","Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the microorganism that causes a significant economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide. IBV is a positivesense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the coronaviruses. All viruses in the family of coronavirus replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Maclachlanand Dubovi, 2010; Cavanagh, 2007) . Virion of IBV has four kinds of proteins in its structure including the spike (S), the membrane (M), the envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N). The major target of IBV is the respiratory system and can also affect the reproductive system and kidneys (Raj and Jones, 1997) . There is no exact cure for infectious bronchitis (IB) due to IBV so, the vaccination is the best way to prevent. However, the variations of IBV that is made during replication may reduce the efficacy of some IBV vaccines (Jackwoodet al, 2007) . Although the vaccination strategy has been adopted, medicinal plants that have antiviral effects can be regarded as an alternative to vaccination or at least can be added to the vaccination programs (de Wit and Cook, 2014) . Allium sativum, garlic in English, belongs to the Alliaceae family (Delahaand Garagusi, 1985) ."
Three-Dimensional Imaging of Drosophila melanogaster,"Background. The major hindrance to imaging the intact adult Drosophila is that the dark exoskeleton makes it impossible to image through the cuticle. We have overcome this obstacle and describe a method whereby the internal organs of adult Drosophila can be imaged in 3D by bleaching and clearing the adult and then imaging using a technique called optical projection tomography (OPT). The data is displayed as 2D optical sections and also in 3D to provide detail on the shape and structure of the adult anatomy. Methodology. We have used OPT to visualize in 2D and 3D the detailed internal anatomy of the intact adult Drosophila. In addition this clearing method used for OPT was tested for imaging with confocal microscopy. Using OPT we have visualized the size and shape of neurodegenerative vacuoles from within the head capsule of flies that suffer from age-related neurodegeneration due to a lack of ADAR mediated RNA-editing. In addition we have visualized tau-lacZ expression in 2D and 3D. This shows that the wholemount adult can be stained without any manipulation and that this stain penetrates well as we have mapped the localization pattern with respect to the internal anatomy. Conclusion. We show for the first time that the intact adult Drosophila can be imaged in 3D using OPT, also we show that this method of clearing is also suitable for confocal microscopy to image the brain from within the intact head. The major advantage of this is that organs can be represented in 3D in their natural surroundings. Furthermore optical sections are generated in each of the three planes and are not prone to the technical limitations that are associated with manual sectioning. OPT can be used to dissect mutant phenotypes and to globally map gene expression in both 2D and 3D.

PLoS ONE 2(9): e834.","Imaging is a vital tool in all areas of Drosophila research; routinely the tissue is dissected and imaged either at low-magnification using the stereomicroscope or at high-magnification using either compound or confocal microscopy. All three techniques are associated with specific disadvantages. Both the stereomicroscope and compound microscope only image in one plane and neither can focus on a point deep within a tissue. Furthermore the upright microscope is used to visualize manually cut sections of tissue, and the processing and sectioning of samples can result in a loss of tissue integrity. Only the confocal can image clearly through the depth of a sample, however it too has disadvantages, for example the tissue may shrink after dissection and can be subjected to shape distortion due to dissection and the mounting procedure. One imaging method that can image internal organs without the need for dissection is optical projection tomography (OPT). OPT images samples in 3D and using associated software the data is used to generate 2D optical sections in each of the three planes, and 3D models. OPT images are estimated to have a pixel resolution of 5-10 mm [1] . However this resolution is dependent upon good signal intensity, a weaker signal will have a resolution that is lower than this estimate."

The immunoregulatory and allergy-associated cytokines in the aetiology of the otitis media with effusion,"Inflammation in the middle ear mucosa, which can be provoked by different primary factors such as bacterial and viral infection, local allergic reactions and reflux, is the crucial event in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME). Unresolved acute inflammatory responses or defective immunoregulation of middle inflammation can promote chronic inflammatory processes and stimulate the chronic condition of OME. Cytokines are the central molecular regulators of middle ear inflammation and can switch the acute phase of inflammation in the chronic stage and induce molecular Á /pathological processes leading to the histopathological changes accompanying OME. In this review we present cytokines identified in otitis media, immunoregulatory [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, transforming growth factorb]) and allergy associated (IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte Á / macrophage colony-stimulating factor), as crucial molecular regulators, responsible for chronic inflammation in the middle ear and the chronic condition of OME.","The immunoregulatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b] and allergy-associated cytokines [IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte Á/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] are mediators of the immune system, which are actively involved in regulation of molecular and cellular processes accompanying different types of inflammation."
"Characterization of the frameshift signal of Edr, a mammalian example of programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting","The ribosomal frameshifting signal of the mouse embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated (Edr) gene represents the sole documented example of programmed À1 frameshifting in mammalian cellular genes [Shigemoto,(2001) , Nucleic Acids Res., 29, 4079-4088]. Here, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing to characterize the Edr signal. We began by confirming the functionality and magnitude of the signal and the role of a GGGAAAC motif as the slippery sequence. Subsequently, we derived a model of the Edr stimulatory RNA and assessed its similarity to those stimulatory RNAs found at viral frameshift sites. We found that the structure is an RNA pseudoknot possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots. From these experiments, we conclude that the Edr signal and by inference, the human orthologue PEG10, do not represent a novel 'cellular class' of programmed À1 ribosomal frameshift signal, but rather are similar to viral examples, albeit with some interesting features. The similarity to viral frameshift signals may complicate the design of antiviral therapies that target the frameshift process.","Programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (hereafter frameshifting for brevity) is a translational control mechanism that allows the production of a specific ratio of gene products from two overlapping open reading frames, the relative quantities of which depend upon the frameshift efficiency at that particular site. Frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein synthesis where, in response to elements in the mRNA, the ribosome switches from the zero reading frame to the À1 frame (in the 5 0 direction) at a defined position, and translation continues in the new frame. The frameshift signals of this class, first described in retroviruses (1, 2) , have subsequently been found (mainly) in other virus genomes and in Escherichia coli insertional elements [reviewed in (3) (4) (5) (6) ]. The mRNA signals that promote frameshifting comprise a slippery sequence, where the frameshift takes place, and a 3 0 -stimulatory RNA structure, separated from the slippery sequence by a short spacer region. The heptanucleotide slippery sequence typically contains consecutive homopolymeric triplets (XXXYYYZ), with the ribosome-bound tRNAs decoding the P-and A-site codons slipping from the zero frame (X XXY YYZ) to the À1 frame (XXX YYY). Studies of frameshifting in eukaryotic systems have indicated that X can be any nucleotide, Y is almost always A or U, and Z any nucleotide but G (although the YYZ codon is often AAG in prokaryotic systems). Efficient frameshifting also requires the presence of the 3 0 -stimulatory RNA beginning $5-9 nt downstream of the slippery sequence. At some sites, a simple stemloop structure appears to be necessary and sufficient for frameshifting but more commonly, an RNA pseudoknot structure is present. These are H-(hairpin)-type pseudoknots (7), although some viral pseudoknots have also been described as kissing hairpins (8, 9) . The mechanism of frameshifting is not fully understood, although a number of models have been proposed to explain how the interaction of the ribosome with the stimulatory RNA leads to a realignment of the tRNAs decoding the slippery sequence into the À1 frame [(10) and references therein]."
Respirator Donning in Post- Hurricane New Orleans,"We evaluated correctness of N95 fi ltering facepiece respirator donning by the public in post-hurricane New Orleans, where respirators were recommended for mold remediation. We randomly selected, interviewed, and observed 538 participants, using multiple logistic regression for analysis. Only 129 (24%) participants demonstrated proper donning. Errors included nose clip not tightened (71%) and straps incorrectly placed (52%); 22% put on the respirator upside down. Factors independently associated with proper donning were as follows: ever having used a mask or respirator (odds ratio [OR] 5.28; 95% confi dence interval [CI], 1.79-22.64); ever having had a respirator fi t test (OR 4.40; 95% CI, 2.52-7.81); being male (OR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.50-4.03); Caucasian race (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.32-3.33); having a certifi ed respirator (OR 1.99, 95% CI, 1.20-3.28); and having participated in mold clean-up (OR 1.82; 95% CI,1.00-3.41). Interventions to improve respirator donning should be considered in planning for infl uenza epidemics and disasters. 700 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 13, No. 5,","Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), particularly disposable N95 fi ltering facepiece respirators (N95 FF respirators [ Figure 1 ]), are available to the public. The certifi cation indicates that the respirator material will perform at a given fi lter effi ciency (1) . Because proper fi t is also necessary for respirator function, US regulations state that an employer who requires workers to wear respirators must establish a respiratory protection program that covers respirator selection and maintenance, fi t testing, and worker instruction (2) . Although nonoccupational respirator use has not been well studied, members of the public who use respirators may be less likely than workers in a respiratory protection program to achieve a proper fi t, given lack of formal training (3) ."
Autopsy in critical illness: is it obsolete?,"The autopsy continues to have important implications for patient management in critical illness. It is not obsolete. Autopsy data help us to track shifts in disease prevalence over time and to heighten surveillance for serious diagnoses that are commonly missed. These data help us to identify important contributors to death that may be remediated through quality assurance and control programs. In discrete patient subsets, information from autopsies may reinforce the degree of certainty surrounding end-of-life decision-making.","In the present issue of Critical Care, Perkins and colleagues revisit the role of autopsy in critically ill patients [1] . These authors evaluated 38 of 49 available autopsy reports in a population of 636 patients (6%). They found that premortem and postmortem findings were in complete agreement in less than one-half of these cases and that major missed diagnoses that might impact on treatment and outcome were present in 39% of the cases reviewed. The most frequently missed diagnoses included myocardial infarction, carcinoma and pulmonary embolism."
Species-independent detection of RNA virus by representational difference analysis using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription,"A method for the isolation of genomic fragments of RNA virus based on cDNA representational difference analysis (cDNA RDA) was developed. cDNA RDA has been applied for the subtraction of poly(A) 1 RNAs but not for poly(A) À RNAs, such as RNA virus genomes, owing to the vast quantity of ribosomal RNAs. We constructed primers for inefficient reverse transcription of ribosomal sequences based on the distribution analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA. The analysis revealed that distributions of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA and virus genome were different. We constructed 96 hexanucleotides (non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) and used them as mixed primers for reverse transcription of cDNA RDA. A synchronous analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in known viral sequences showed that all the known genomic-size viral sequences include non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. In a model experiment, when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used as primers, in vitro transcribed plasmid RNA was efficiently reverse transcribed when compared with ribosomal RNA of rat cells. Using nonribosomal primers, the cDNA fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were efficiently amplified by subtracting the cDNA amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those that were derived from virus-infected cells. The results suggest that cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal primers can be used for species-independent detection of viruses, including new viruses.","Identifying the causative agent of an infectious disease is the cornerstone for its eventual control. For example, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1) . Developments in molecular biological approaches in recent years have led to the identification of many unknown pathogens. Once a fragment from the agent's genome has been isolated and sequenced, standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence, and computer homology searches can then be used to identify the likely phylogenetic relationship of the agent with other known organisms (2) . Additionally, sequences of some viruses, such as SARS-CoV, have altered during transmission, and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a PCR method (3, 4) . Thus, a detection method that is not based on the known sequence is essentially required as an alternative method to the normal PCR method."
,"Epidemiology studies are an essential part of clinical research, often forming the foundation for studies ranked more highly in the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine. Studies of sepsis to date have been conducted on local, regional, national and international scales, with the majority conducted in the past 5 years. Longitudinal epidemiology studies convey an important additional aspect of the healthcare burden from disease, and may additionally serve to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare systems, to examine specific patient care strategies and to perform quality control analyses.","Critical care epidemiology studies, of which the current study from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Center database is a good example [1] , serve a variety of purposes that advance the mission of both practicing intensive care unit (ICU) physicians and scientific researchers. At the most basic level, epidemiology studies convey important information about disease characteristics, the type of patients affected, and the frequency and outcomes of the disease. Importantly, these studies keep medical events in perspective. Epidemiology studies report and reinforce the frequency of deaths related to atherosclerotic disease, cancer and sepsis in developed countries, and of deaths from a variety of infectious diseases and sepsis in developing countries. These reminders are essential in an era of increasing media attention on diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza that are less immediate public health concerns."
"Synthesis, Binding and Antiviral Properties of Potent Core-Extended Naphthalene Diimides Targeting the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat Promoter G-Quadruplexes","We have previously reported that stabilization of the G-quadruplex structures in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter suppresses viral transcription. Here we sought to develop new G-quadruplex ligands to be exploited as antiviral compounds by enhancing binding toward the viral G-quadruplex structures. We synthesized naphthalene diimide derivatives with a lateral expansion of the aromatic core. The new compounds were able to bind/stabilize the G-quadruplex to a high extent, and some of them displayed clear-cut selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes with respect to the human telomeric Gquadruplexes. This feature translated into low nanomolar anti-HIV-1 activity toward two viral strains and encouraging selectivity indexes. The selectivity depended on specific recognition of LTR loop residues; the mechanism of action was ascribed to inhibition of LTR promoter activity in cells. This is the first example of G-quadruplex ligands that show increased selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes and display remarkable antiviral activity.","G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in single-stranded G-rich sequences under physiological conditions. 1−3 Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which in turn stack on top of each other to form the G4. G4 structures may significantly vary, both in terms of strand stoichiometry (forming both inter-and intramolecular structures) and strand orientation/topology. The presence of K + cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability. 4−6 In the human genome and in prokaryotes, G4 DNA motifs have been found in telomeres, G-rich micro-and mini-satellites, near oncogene promoters, and within the rDNA. 7−12 Human G4 DNA motifs have been reported to be associated with recombination prone regions 13 and to show mutational patterns that preserve the potential to form G4 DNA structures. 9 Misregulation of these G4 structures has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders. 14−18 The identification of G4 binding proteins 19 and their visualization in cells with antibody-based technology 20, 21 have also provided convincing evidence of the existence of cellular G4s in vivo."

When an infectious disease case occurs in a worker, investigators need to understand the mechanisms of disease propagation in the workplace. Few publications have explored these factors in the United States; a literature search yielded 66 investigations of infectious disease occurring in US workplaces during 2006-2015. Reported cases appear to be concentrated in specific industries and occupations, especially the healthcare industry, laboratory workers, animal workers, and public service workers. A hierarchy-of-controls approach can help determine how to implement effective preventive measures in workplaces. Consideration of occupational risk factors and control of occupational exposures will help prevent disease transmission in the workplace and protect workers' health."

Quantitative trace analysis of a broad range of antiviral drugs in poultry muscle using column-switch liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry,"A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of seven antiviral drugs, zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol, in poultry muscle is reported. The antiviral drugs were extracted from the homogenized poultry muscle sample using methanol. The extract was purified using tandem solid-phase extraction combining a cation exchange cartridge and a phenylboronic acid cartridge. To prevent excessive matrix effects, the analytes were separated from the matrix constituents using a column-switch liquid chromatography system combining a reversed-phase and a Hypercarb analytical column. Detection was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry. The method was fully validated according to 2002/657/EC [1] and proved to be adequate for quantification and confirmation of zanamivir and ribavirin at 10 μg kg −1 , oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine at levels below 1.0 μg kg −1 and for qualitative confirmatory analysis of arbidol at levels below 1 μg kg −1 .","Influenza infections continue to pose a serious problem. Recent outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) have had a huge economic effect in the poultry breeding sector [2, 3] but besides the economic effect, human health is at stake because avian influenza can also infect mammals including humans [4, 5] . The increasing incidence of resistance to antiviral drugs is a major concern to public health. Because strains tend to become more aggressive, adequate therapeutic strategies are needed [6] ."
Pulmonary penetration of piperacillin and tazobactam in critically ill patients Europe PMC Funders Group Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts,"Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are common and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Piperacillin-tazobactam is a frequently used therapy in critically ill patients with pulmonary infection. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intra-pulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin-tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard piperacillin-tazobactam regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intra-pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic endpoints and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratio was 49.3% and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentration were unpredictable and negatively correlated to pulmonary permeability. Current piperacillin-tazobactam regimens may be insufficient to treat pneumonia caused by piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible organisms in some critically ill patients.","Pulmonary infection in critically ill patients results in an unacceptably high mortality and morbidity, which increases the length of hospital stay and associated healthcare costs 1, 2 . Approximately 16% of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) present with a pulmonary infection 3 . Additionally, the lung is the primary site of infection in over 60% of nosocomial infections occurring within the ICU 3 . Attributable mortality from ventilatorassociated pneumonia is estimated to be 13%, but may be as high as 69% in certain subgroups 4 . Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are caused by a wide range of organisms, including difficult-to-treat organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 . Use of appropriately targeted antimicrobial chemotherapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes 6 . However, clinical outcomes in patients that are infected with a susceptible organism receiving an appropriate antimicrobial agent remain sub-optimal. This is partly due to marked pharmacokinetic (PK) variability occurring in critically ill patients 7 . The PK of critically ill patients may be affected by physiological changes associated with illness, which typically results in a higher proportion of patients receiving sub-optimal drug exposure when a fixed regimen is used [7] [8] [9] . Additionally, many currently licensed drug regimens are informed by studies performed in non-critically ill patients, and may not necessarily be appropriate outside that context."
"SARS Risk Perception, Knowledge, Precautions, and Information Sources, the Netherlands","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related risk perceptions, knowledge, precautionary actions, and information sources were studied in the Netherlands during the 2003 SARS outbreak.

,"Pilgrims returning from the Hajj might contribute to international spreading of respiratory pathogens. Nasal and throat swab specimens were obtained from 129 pilgrims in 2013 before they departed from France and before they left Saudi Arabia, and tested by PCR for respiratory viruses and bacteria. Overall, 21.5% and 38.8% of pre-Hajj and post-Hajj specimens, respectively, were positive for ≥1 virus (p = 0.003). One third (29.8%) of the participants acquired ≥1 virus, particularly rhinovirus (14.0%), coronavirus E229 (12.4%), and influenza A(H3N2) virus (6.2%) while in Saudi Arabia. None of the participants were positive for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In addition, 50.0% and 62.0% of pre-Hajj and post-Hajj specimens, respectively, were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae (p = 0.053). One third (36.3%) of the participants had acquired S. pneumoniae during their stay. Our results confirm high acquisition rates of rhinovirus and S. pneumoniae in pilgrims and highlight the acquisition of coronavirus E229.","M ore than 2 million Muslims gather annually in Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam known as the Hajj. The Hajj presents major public health and infection control challenges. Inevitable overcrowding within a confined area with persons from >180 countries in close contact with others, particularly during the circumambulation of the Kaaba (Tawaf) inside the Grand Mosque in Mecca, leads to a high risk pilgrims to acquire and spread infectious diseases during their time in Saudi Arabia (1), particularly respiratory diseases (2) . Respiratory diseases are a major cause of consultation in primary health care facilities in Mina, Saudi Arabia, during the Hajj (3). Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization in intensive care units (4) ."
Matrix Protein 2 Vaccination,"Changes in influenza viruses require regular reformulation of strain-specific influenza vaccines. Vaccines based on conserved antigens provide broader protection. Influenza matrix protein 2 (M2) is highly conserved across influenza A subtypes. To evaluate its efficacy as a vaccine candidate, we vaccinated mice with M2 peptide of a widely shared consensus sequence. This vaccination induced antibodies that cross-reacted with divergent M2 peptide from an H5N1 subtype. A DNA vaccine expressing fulllength consensus-sequence M2 (M2-DNA) induced M2specific antibody responses and protected against challenge with lethal influenza. Mice primed with M2-DNA and then boosted with recombinant adenovirus expressing M2 (M2-Ad) had enhanced antibody responses that crossreacted with human and avian M2 sequences and produced T-cell responses. This M2 prime-boost vaccination conferred broad protection against challenge with lethal influenza A, including an H5N1 strain. Vaccination with M2, with key sequences represented, may provide broad protection against influenza A.","Y early development of influenza vaccines that are antigenically matched to circulating strains poses extraordinary challenges. A rapidly developing pandemic would shorten the time for strain identification and vaccine preparation; meanwhile, antigenic changes would continue. Moreover, the need to immunize an entirely naive population would exacerbate problems with vaccine production and supply."
Clinical review: Mass casualty triage -pandemic influenza and critical care,"Worst case scenarios for pandemic influenza planning in the US involve over 700,000 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. UK planning predicts a 231% occupancy of current level 3 (intensive care unit) bed capacity. Critical care planners need to recognise that mortality is likely to be high and the risk to healthcare workers significant. Contingency planning should, therefore, be multifaceted, involving a robust health command structure, the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space, equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages. It should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care, demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid, reproducible, transparent and consistent with distributive justice. We advocate the development and validation of physiological scores for use as a triage tool, coupled with candid public discussion of the process.","It is widely accepted that conditions exist for the evolution of a new strain of influenza virus with the potential to cause a human pandemic [1] . The biggest challenge in planning for an influenza pandemic is the range of unknown factors; its nature and impact cannot be fully predicted until the pandemic virus actually emerges. Those planning for a pandemic must, therefore, work from a number of assumptions based on knowledge gained from previous pandemics and scientific modelling of a range of potential scenarios. The UK Pandemic Influenza Plan [2] sets out a range of possible scenarios for clinical attack rates and case fatality rates during a pandemic, including the potential for more than one wave. The base scenario assumes a clinical attack rate of 25% and a case fatality rate of 0.37%, giving rise to 53,700 excess deaths in the UK. A reasonable worst case scenario involves a cumulative clinical attack rate of 50% with 2.5% case fatality, causing 709,300 excess deaths. Similarly, the US Department of Health and Human Services predicts that in a ""moderate"" scenario based on a virus with 1968-like pathogenicity, 865,000 will require hospitalisation and 65,000 (7.5%) will require ventilation. They also outline a ""severe"" 1918-like scenario with 9.9 million hospitalisations and 743,000 patients requiring ventilation [3] ."
"A 25-Year-Old Sample Contributes the Complete Genome Sequence of Avian Coronavirus Vaccine Strain ArkDPI, Reisolated from Commercial Broilers in the United States","Here, we report the complete genome sequence of Avian coronavirus strain ArkDPI of the GI-9 lineage, isolated from broiler chickens in North Georgia in 1994. This is the complete genome sequence of this vaccine strain, reisolated from broilers in the United States.","A vian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Gammacoronavirus) is a respiratory pathogen that causes severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide (1) (2) (3) (4) . Numerous IBV variants have been reported in the United States (5) . However, the Arkansas type is one of the most common IBV serotypes isolated from chickens in the field (6, 7) . Currently, only Arkansas Delmarva Poultry Industry (ArkDPI) attenuated live vaccine is commercially available against the Ark-IBV serotype (6) . It has been shown that the ArkDPI live attenuated vaccine can persist in flocks (8) , causing a rolling reaction by continuing transmission of the vaccine virus to the unvaccinated chickens, which results in increased virulence of the vaccine and vaccine reactions in the flock (6, 9) . This is unique to the ArkDPI vaccine and is due to a minor subpopulation in the vaccine, exhibiting polymorphisms in the spike 1 (S1) protein. Reisolation of the ArkDPI vaccine virus from chickens has shown that two amino acid changes in the S1 protein, Y43H and Δ344, are the most common mutations observed (7, (10) (11) (12) (13) . In this study, we report the complete genome of the ArkDPI vaccine virus, reisolated from chickens in the United States."
"Risk Factors for Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Seroconversion among Hospital Staff, Singapore","We describe incidence and risk factors for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in healthcare personnel during the June-September 2009 epidemic in Singapore. Personnel contributed 3 serologic samples during June-October 2009, with seroconversion defi ned as a >4-fold increase in hemagglutination inhibition titers to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Of 531 participants, 35 showed evidence of seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest in nurses (28/290) and lowest in allied health staff (2/116). Signifi cant risk factors on multivariate analysis were being a nurse (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.5, 95% confi dence interval [CI] 1.0-19.6) and working in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards (aOR 4.5, 95% CI 1.3-15.6). Contact with pandemic (H1N1) 2009-infected colleagues (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-6.6) and larger household size (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4) were of borderline signifi cance. Our study suggests that seroconversion was associated with occupational and nonoccupational risk factors.","D uring the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), large nosocomial outbreaks of SARS occurred in several hospitals in Singapore (1, 2) . Since then, concerns have been raised about how emerging infections, in particular respiratory infections, could result in transmission from patients to healthcare workers and vice versa, given the high frequency and intensity of healthcare worker contacts in the hospital environment (3) . For pandemic infl uenza, additional concerns exist that even mild disease might result in staff absenteeism and, subsequently, would reduce staff strength at a time of increased demand for health services (4) ."
HISTORICAL REVIEW 980 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"The term epidemic (from the Greek epi [on] plus demos [people]), first used by Homer, took its medical meaning when Hippocrates used it as the title of one of his famous treatises. At that time, epidemic was the name given to a collection of clinical syndromes, such as coughs or diarrheas, occurring and propagating in a given period at a given location. Over centuries, the form and meaning of the term have changed. Successive epidemics of plague in the Middle Ages contributed to the definition of an epidemic as the propagation of a single, well-defined disease. The meaning of the term continued to evolve in the 19th-century era of microbiology. Its most recent semantic evolution dates from the last quarter of the 20th century, and this evolution is likely to continue in the future.","A t the start of the 21st century, epidemics of infectious diseases continue to be a threat to humanity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and HIV/AIDS have, in recent years, supported the reality of this threat. Civil wars and natural catastrophes are sometimes followed by epidemics. Climate change, tourism, the concentration of populations in refugee camps, the emergence of new human pathogens, and ecologic changes, which often accompany economic development, contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases and epidemics (1) . Epidemics, however, have occurred throughout human history and have influenced that history. The term epidemic is ≈2,500 years old, but where does it come from?"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HBoV infection in children hospitalized with acute LRTI in South Korea."
Draft versus finished sequence data for DNA and protein diagnostic signature development,"Sequencing pathogen genomes is costly, demanding careful allocation of limited sequencing resources. We built a computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP) to guide decisions regarding the amount of genomic sequencing necessary to develop high-quality diagnostic DNA and protein signatures. SAP uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors or NNs) to sequence. We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that intermediate to high-quality draft with error rates of 10 À3 -10 À5 ($83 coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of $1% (33 to 63 coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.","Draft sequencing requires that the order of base pairs in cloned fragments of a genome be determined usually at least four times (4· depth of coverage) at each position for a minimum degree of draft accuracy. This information is assembled into contigs, or fragments of the genome that cannot be joined further due to lack of sequence information across gaps between the contigs. To generate high-quality draft, usually $8· coverage is optimal (1). Finished sequence, without gaps or ambiguous base calls, usually requires 8· to 10· coverage, along with additional analyses, often manual, to orient the contigs relative to one another and to close the gaps between them in a process called finishing. In fact, it has been stated that 'the defining distinction of draft sequencing is the avoidance of significant human intervention' (1) , although there are computational tools that may also be capable of automated finishing in some circumstances (2) ."
Advanced Querying Features for Disease Surveillance Systems Advanced Querying Features for Disease Surveillance Systems,"Most automated disease surveillance systems notify users of increases in the prevalence of reports in syndrome categories and allow users to view patient level data related to those increases. Occasionally, a more dynamic level of control is required to properly detect an emerging disease in a community. Dynamic querying features are invaluable when using existing surveillance systems to investigate outbreaks of newly emergent diseases or to identify cases of reportable diseases within data being captured for surveillance. The objective of the Advance Querying Tool (AQT) is to build a more flexible query interface for most web-based disease surveillance systems. This interface allows users to define and build their query as if they were writing a logical expression for a mathematical computation. The AQT allows users to develop, investigate, save, and share complex case definitions. It provides a flexible interface that accommodates both advanced and novice users, checks the validity of the expression as it is built, and marks errors for users.","In its 2007 annual report, the World Health Organization warned of the increased rate at which diseases spread in a world where 2 billion people travel by air [1] . The early detection of known and emerging illnesses is becoming more important. Automated disease surveillance systems have been in existence for over 10 years [2] [3] [4] . Most of these systems analyze data by syndrome and search for disease outbreaks. A syndrome in this context is defined as a group of diseases related in some fashion, such as respiratory diseases. This level of investigation is often sufficient, but a more dynamic level of control may be required to understand an emerging illness in a community."
PLANT-Dx: A Molecular Diagnostic for Point-of-Use Detection of Plant Pathogens,"Synthetic biology based diagnostic technologies have improved upon gold standard diagnostic methodologies by decreasing cost, increasing accuracy, and enhancing portability. However, there has been little effort in adapting these technologies toward applications related to point-of-use monitoring of plant and crop health. Here, we take a step toward this vision by developing an approach that couples isothermal amplification of specific plant pathogen genomic sequences with customizable synthetic RNA regulators that are designed to trigger the production of a colorimetric output in cell-free gene expression reactions. We demonstrate our system can sense viral derived sequences with high sensitivity and specificity, and can be utilized to directly detect viruses from infected plant material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the entire system can operate using only body heat and naked-eye visual analysis of outputs. We anticipate these strategies to be important components of user-friendly and deployable diagnostic systems that can be configured to detect a range of important plant pathogens.","S ynthetic biology has recently contributed to multiple advances in point-of-use nucleic acid diagnostic (PoUD) technologies. 1 These technologies leverage isothermal strategies to amplify target nucleic acids, with new advances in detection of these targets using strand-displacement, 2 or CRISPR-based methods 3,4 that produce fluorescent readouts, or RNA toehold switches that control translation of enzymes that produce colored compounds. 5 Overall these technologies can be used for sensitive detection of pathogen-derived nucleic acids in complex matrices in field-deployable formats that significantly improve upon current laboratory-intensive PCRbased approaches."

As genetic traits contribute significantly to cerebral infarction variations in the genetic regulation of inflammatory system may increase the risk of the disease from individual to individual. 1 IFN-γ has antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumor properties. 2 Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and plaque induced inflammation is considered a cause of intimal erosion and rupture and therefore leads to acute ischemia. 1,3 IFN-γ has important immunoregulatory roles and enhances both antigen specific and non-specific immune responses through actions on monocytes and macrophages. 4, 5 Complications related to infections such as chest and urinary tract infections, have been reported to occur in 23-65% of all stroke patients within the first few days after stroke. 6,7 Brain injury was identified as an independent risk factor for infectious complications in trauma patients due to a central nervous shutdown of the immune defense. 8, 9 Howard et al, reported association of immunosuppressive state with stroke. 10 IFN-γ is one of the key effector cytokines produced by NK and T cells that enhances microbicidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils. Several gene polymorphisms are associated with stroke in humans, 11 association between the gene polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokines are meager. In the present study we have examined single nucleotide polymorphism in interferon gamma (IFNγ) at position +874A/T in South Indian ischemic stroke patients."
EMERGENCE OF SARS,"During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which targets the nucleocapsid gene at the 3' end of the viral genome, was established to detect and identify the SARS-associated coronavirus. We describe the use of this assay to screen >700 clinical samples.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease of humans, first recognized in late February 2003 in Hanoi, Vietnam. The disease spread rapidly, with cases reported from 29 countries on five continents over 4 months (1-7). By July 3, 2003 , this epidemic resulted in 8,439 reported cases globally, of which 812 were fatal (8) . Rapid identification of the causal agent as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) represents an extraordinary achievement in the history of global health and helped to contain the epidemic (7) . Nonetheless, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS remain poorly understood, and definitive diagnostic tests or specific treatments are not established. Since the origin of the virus and its animal reservoirs remain to be defined, the potential for recurrence is unknown. This fact underscores the importance of establishing sensitive and efficient methods for diagnosis and surveillance."
"Novel Lyssavirus in Bat, Spain","A new tentative lyssavirus, Lleida bat lyssavirus, was found in a bent-winged bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Spain. It does not belong to phylogroups I or II, and it seems to be more closely related to the West Causasian bat virus, and especially to the Ikoma lyssavirus.","B ats have been considered natural hosts of a wide diversity of viruses, including human pathogens such as lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, henipavirus, and filoviruses (1) .

,"To analyze the distribution of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-seropositive dromedary camels in eastern Africa, we tested 189 archived serum samples accumulated during the past 30 years. We identified MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in 81.0% of samples from the main camel-exporting countries, Sudan and Somalia, suggesting long-term virus circulation in these animals.","S ince 2012, a newly emerged human pathogenic coronavirus (CoV) has caused an ongoing epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula. The designated Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus lineage C and causes severe respiratory disease in humans (1) . As of July 2, 2014, MERS-CoV has caused ≈842 human infections, including 322 deaths (2) . Dromedary camels are a putative source for MERS-CoV infection in humans. Dromedaries from countries in Africa (Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya) and Arabia (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Jordan) have shown high rates of MERS-CoV seropositivity in serum samples collected during the past 2 decades (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . In addition, MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and virus were detected in respiratory swab samples, predominantly from juvenile dromedaries (5, 10) . Transmission between humans and camels has been described in Qatar and Saudi Arabia (11, 12) . No autochthonous MERS-CoV infections in humans have been reported in Africa. Most dromedary camels traded in the Middle East are bred in the Greater Horn of Africa, primarily in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, and Kenya (13). To further analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of MERS-CoV-seropositive camels, we tested archived camel serum samples originating in Egypt, Sudan, and Somalia, accumulated during the past 30 years, for MERS-CoV antibodies."
Lobar flexible fiberoptic lung lavage: therapeutic benefit in severe respiratory failure in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and influenza A H1N1 pneumonia,"Lobar fiberoptic lung lavage is a well-known procedure used in primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP); the use of this procedure has increased in the recent years. This procedure has also been used in other pulmonary diseases such as desquamative interstitial pneumonia with good results. We describe a case of extremely severe respiratory failure due to concurrence of PAP and Influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia which resolved with the help of this procedure. The patient, a 41year-old woman, needed less mechanical ventilation after undergoing lobar fiberoptic bronchoscopic lavage. Moreover, a rapid and progressive improvement in the computed tomography of the lungs was observed. Flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopic lobar lavage is a simple, safe procedure used not only in milder disease, but also in particular severe cases in which the physiological derangement of whole lung lavage would not be tolerated by patient or when extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is not available.","Lobar or total lung lavage by flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is an alternative to whole lung lavage (WLL) in the treatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). [1] [2] [3] [4] Bronchopulmonary lavage was introduced by J. Ramirez and used not only in alveolar proteinosis but also in status asthmaticus 5 and in desquamative interstitial pneumonia 2 with good results.The use of multiple segmental or lobar lavage by FOB has been reported in English medical literature in less than 10 cases but often with interesting results. [1] [2] [3] [4] 6 Partial lung lavage, performed with bronchoscope has been considered a possibility when WLL is potentially harmful as in the case of severe hypoxemia and when extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is not feasible. 7 This option is also indicated for children. Since there is no pediatric-size double-lumen endotracheal tube available,unilateral lung lavage by bronchofiberscope and selective ventilation, with cuffed endotracheal tube, is an alternative. 7 Paquet and Karsli also utilized a twocuffed endotracheal tube for the treatment of a pediatric patient. 8 Based on these experience we report a case of a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and presenting an influenza A H1N1 pneumonia treated and resolved with helping of FOB."
Veterinary Science Detection and molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis virus isolated from recent outbreaks in broiler flocks in Thailand,"January and June 2008. The 878-bp of the S1 gene covering a hypervariable region was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on that region revealed that these viruses were separated into two groups (I and II). IBV isolates in group I were not related to other IBV strains published in the GenBank database. Group 1 nucleotide sequence identities were less than 85% and amino acid sequence identities less than 84% in common with IBVs published in the GenBank database. This group likely represents the strains indigenous to Thailand. The isolates in group II showed a close relationship with Chinese IBVs. They had nucleotide sequence identities of 97-98% and amino acid sequence identities 96-98% in common with Chinese IBVs (strain A2, SH and QXIBV). This finding indicated that the recent Thai IBVs evolved separately and at least two groups of viruses are circulating in Thailand.","Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by the IB virus (IBV), is a highly contagious disease and results in a significant economic loss to the commercial chicken industry. The disease frequently causes respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge. In layer fowls, respiratory distress and a decrease in egg production have been reported [10] . In addition, some strains have been associated with kidney lesions [18, 19, 22] . IBV, the causative agent of IB, belongs to the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae [6] . It is an enveloped virus and has a positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA genome, approximately 27 kb in length. The virion has three major structural proteins namely the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the spike (S) glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits [6] . The S1 subunit, located on the outside of the virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the host cell membrane. Moreover, it is responsible for neutralizing serotype-specific antibodies in chickens [4] . The S1 subunit demonstrates more sequence variability than S2 [14] . Neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes are associated with the defined hypervariable region (HVR) in the S1 subunit; therefore, the molecular characterization of IBV is based on analysis of the S1 gene [12] . During 1953 During -1954 , the first IBV outbreak was reported in Thailand [7] . Although many IB vaccine strains such as Connecticut, H120, Ma5, M41 and Armidale A3, have been used in Thailand for many years, IBV outbreaks have been ongoing [1] . Moreover, the relationships between recent Thai IBV isolates and foreign IBV isolates are not known. The objective of this study was to characterize IBV field isolates in the recent outbreak of the disease in Thailand by analyzing the S1 gene and compared them with those that have been published previously."
,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a widespread respiratory virus. To improve diagnostic methods, we conducted immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM enzyme immunoassays with recombinant virus-like particles of HBoV as antigen. Acutephase and follow-up serum samples from 258 wheezing children and single serum samples from 115 healthy adults in Finland were examined. Our assays had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99.5%. Of adults, 96% had immunity; none had an acute infection. Of 48 children with serologically diagnosed acute HBoV infections, 45 were viremic and 35 had virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). Of 39 HBoV NPA PCR-positive children co-infected with another virus, 64% had a serologically verified HBoV infection. HBoV caused illness of longer duration than rhinovirus and of equal severity to that of respiratory syncytial virus. Among children with bronchiolitis, >25% had acute HBoV infections. Accurate HBoV diagnosis requires serologic analysis or PCR of serum; PCR of NPAs alone is insufficient.","covered during sequencing of respiratory tract samples from children. It has been detected worldwide in the nasopharyngeal tract, mainly in small children with lower respiratory tract infections (1, 2) . HBoV has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and shown to be a cause of pneumonia in children (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Prolonged shedding of virus has been reported; >26% of children shed virus for 2 months, 4% for 3 months, and 2% for 4 months (9) . Diagnosis of HBoV respiratory tract infections has been PCR based, leading to overrepresentation of HBoV co-infections with other respiratory viruses (9) (10) (11) ."
An atypical RNA pseudoknot stimulator and an upstream attenuation signal for À1 ribosomal frameshifting of SARS coronavirus,"The À1 ribosomal frameshifting requires the existence of an in cis RNA slippery sequence and is promoted by a downstream stimulator RNA. An atypical RNA pseudoknot with an extra stem formed by complementary sequences within loop 2 of an H-type pseudoknot is characterized in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome. This pseudoknot can serve as an efficient stimulator for À1 frameshifting in vitro. Mutational analysis of the extra stem suggests frameshift efficiency can be modulated via manipulation of the secondary structure within the loop 2 of an infectious bronchitis virus-type pseudoknot. More importantly, an upstream RNA sequence separated by a linker 5 0 to the slippery site is also identified to be capable of modulating the À1 frameshift efficiency. RNA sequence containing this attenuation element can downregulate À1 frameshifting promoted by an atypical pseudoknot of SARS CoV and two other pseudoknot stimulators. Furthermore, frameshift efficiency can be reduced to half in the presence of the attenuation signal in vivo. Therefore, this in cis RNA attenuator represents a novel negative determinant of general importance for the regulation of À1 frameshift efficiency, and is thus a potential antiviral target.","The À1 ribosomal frameshifting is a translational regulation mechanism adopted by a variety of viruses to synthesize two or more proteins at a fixed ratio starting with a single translation initiation site from the same open reading frame (ORF) (1) (2) (3) (4) . In response to the programmed frameshifting signals in messenger RNA (mRNA), the ribosome is induced to move one base backward in the 5 0 direction, and then continues translation in the new À1 reading frame. The ratio between the two protein products from frameshifting can be determined by the frameshift efficiency of the stimulation signals and can be a key factor for the propagation of virus within the host. It has been suggested to be a potential antiviral target for the interference of viral propagation (5) ."
"Spatial Distribution of Diarrhoea and Microbial Quality of Domestic Water during an Outbreak of Diarrhoea in the Tshikuwi Community in Venda, South Africa","Total microbial quality assessment and geographical information system were used for evaluating the quality of water and the spatial distribution of diarrhoea cases in Tshikuwi, a rural community in South Africa, during an outbreak of diarrhoea. The water-abstraction points included two groundwater storage tanks, namely Tank 1 and Tank 2 and the Khandanama river. Indicator microbial counts for total coliforms, faecal coliforms, enterococci, and heterotrophic bacteria exceeded the limit for no risk as stipulated by the South African water-quality guidelines for domestic use for Tank 1 and the Khandanama river. Vibrio, Salmonella, and Shigella species were prevalent in the Khandanama river. The spatial distribution of diarrhoea cases showed a hot-spot of diarrhoea cases close to Tank 1 and the Khandanama river. Results of chi-square analysis showed that the proportion of infection from each water source was different or that infection depends on the type of water source (α=0.05). The demonstrated spatial clustering of diarrhoea cases might have been influenced by the poor microbial quality of water used from Tank 1 and the Khandanama river. The results further highlight the urgent need of water-treatment facilities and monitoring of water quality in rural communities of South Africa.","Worldwide, around 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water sources, and 2.4 billion have no basic sanitation. Each year, there are approximately four billion cases of diarrhoea worldwide, and infectious diarrhoea is widespread throughout the developing world (1) . Poor quality of water, sanitation, and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year, mainly due to infectious diarrhoea. Nine of 10 of such deaths occur in children, with a significant majority of deaths in developing countries (2) ."
Poly(amidoamine) Dendrimer Nanocarriers and their Aerosol Formulations for siRNA Delivery to the Lung Epithelium,"In order to determine the minimum RNase A concentration to degrade siRNA completely, siRNA (300 ng) was incubated with different amounts of RNase A in TE 1X pH 8 buffer (0.02, 0.07, 0.162, 0.348, 0.7, and 3.3 g RNase A per 1 g siRNA) for 45 min at 37C, in presence or absence of RiboLock ® RNase Inhibitor (RI, 1L = 40U). The concentration of 0.35 g RNase A per 1 g siRNA has been reported in literature to be enough to degrade a large fraction of siRNA in polyplexes, 1, 2 and based on that, the amount of RNase A was varied in this experiment. Next, samples were frozen at -20C overnight, and loaded in the slots of casted agarose gel (1.5 % w/v in TAE 1X pH 8.2 buffer) stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g  mL -1 ). The electrophoresis was performed at 60V (E0160-VWR Mini Gel Electrophoresis) for 40 min, and the siRNA-dye migration was visualized under UV irradiation (FOTO/Analyst ® Investigator/Eclipse with UV Transilluminator Fotodyne Inc.) and the images were recorded using the FOTO/Analyst ® PC Image software (v.5). The result is shown in Figure S1 , and clearly indicates that free siRNA (not protected by RNase inhibitor) was completely degraded by RNAse A starting at concentration 0.162 g RNase A per 1 g siRNA, since no siRNA band was observed in lane 6 compared to lane 7 and lane 1.",".

Heparin decomplexation assay. Heparin is known as a model polyanion competing agent with nucleic acids for electrostatic interactions with polycations, 3 and it has been used to dissociate siRNA from several polycationic carriers. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Thus, heparin was used in this work to dissociate siRNA from PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer. In order to determine the most favorable condition of heparin treatment to release the highest siRNA content from the dendriplexes, siRNA-G4NH2 at N/P 10 were formed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer, 10 as described in the Experimental Section, incubated with heparin in TE 1X pH 8 buffer at 37C for different time points, and frozen at -20C overnight. The final heparin concentration was 5 mg  mL -1 corresponding to 455 U per 1 g siRNA calculated based on 1000 U per 1 mL. 4 The final siRNA concentration after dilution of the dendriplexes to 1 mL was 80 nM. siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes incubated in presence or absence of heparin (minimum of three independent batches, n = 3) were quantitatively analyzed using PicoGreen ® assay 11 in Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT) for the siRNA content released, which was calculated using a linear calibration curve (siRNA concentration vs. fluorescent units). Thus, siRNA released from the dendriplexes due to heparin treatment was determined based on the difference between the siRNA content truly complexed with G4NH2 (siRNA CE was applied in the calculations) and the free siRNA released and remaining in the dendriplexes dispersion. Appropriate control (PAMAM G4NH2 in presence of heparin, but no siRNA) was used as blank. The results are shown in Figure S2 , and indicate that the siRNA is released from G4NH2 dendrimer due to treatment of the dendriplexes with heparin. The incubation time of 30 min released the highest siRNA content -80% on average, and narrower standard deviation -out of the total siRNA complexed with G4NH2, and thus, it was chosen as standard time for all further heparin decomplexation assay experiments. constitutively express eGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) according to GenTarget protocol. 12 Briefly, A549 cells (passage 5) were seeded in 24-well microplate (25,000 cells per well) and cultured in 500 L DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% AB (v/v) for 24 h at 37C and 5% CO 2 (Thermo Scientific Incubator, NAPCO 8000WJ). Cells were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, and fresh culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% AB, v/v) was added to them, following 50 L per well of eGFP lentiviral particles. Cells were kept in incubator for 72 h at 37C and 5% CO 2 , and after that, they were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, and the puromycin selective medium was added to them (DMEM + 10% FBS + 2.5 g  mL -1 puromycin selective antibiotic; concentration was previously determined by a kill curve). Cells were cultured under this selective condition for 4 weeks, 13 dendriplexes alone were attempted to be formulated as pMDI. Dendriplexes at N/P 10 were prepared in RNase-free DI-water, the aqueous dispersion (siRNA and PAMAM G4NH2 at the same amount as what is loaded into CSLA and mannitol particles) was placed into the pressure proof glass vial, which was frozen (-20C) and lyophilized. The canister was crimp sealed with a 63 L metering valve, and a known volume of propellant HFA-227 was filled into it so that the siRNA concentration was the same for pMDI formulations containing dendriplexes loaded into CSLA or mannitol particles. Then, the formulation was placed into sonication bath (30 min at 15 -20C) to disperse the dendriplexes in the propellant. As a result, the dendriplexes were observed getting stuck on the wall of the glass vial, and even after sonication for a long time, they did not disperse in the propellant as seen in Figure S5 . Thus, it was not possible to have pMDI formulations of free siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes for further comparison with those prepared with CSLA and mannitol particles. Therefore, this result presents the difficulty of formulating siRNA-based dendriplexes alone in propellant HFA, and strongly suggests that an appropriate micro-carrier is needed for the job -such as CSLA and mannitol which are being proposed in this work. Figure S5 . Free siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes at N/P 10 did not disperse in propellant HFA-227"

Chemical and Structural Aspects of Ebola Virus Entry Inhibitors,"The Ebolaviruses are members of the family Filoviridae (""filoviruses"") and cause severe hemhorragic fever with human case fatality rates as high as 90%. Infection requires attachment of the viral particle to cells and triggering of membrane fusion between the host and viral membranes, a process that occurs in the host endosome and is facilitated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). One potential strategy for therapeutic intervention is the development of agents (antibodies, peptides, and small molecules) that can interfere with viral entry aspects such as attachment, uptake, priming, or membrane fusion. This paper highlights recent developments in the discovery and evaluation of therapeutic entry inhibitors and identifies opportunities moving forward. 65 76 BDBV (R4QRCO-9MONO) 66 77","T he family Filoviridae, the constituents of which are known as filoviruses, includes five species of Ebolaviruses, two species of Marburg virus (MARV), and one species of Cuevavirus. 1,2 Infection by pathogenic filovirus species results in severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever. Each of the Ebolavirus species is named after the region in which it was identified: Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Tai Forest (TAFV), and Reston (RESTV). Both EBOV and SUDV have been associated with recurring large outbreaks; two isolates of EBOV (Guinea and Sierra Leone) are the cause of the current epidemic in West Africa. The human case fatality rates for each of these Ebolavirus species varies according to outbreak, but in general EBOV has been associated with the highest mortality (up to 90%) followed by SUDV and BDBV. 3 Only one case of TAFV has been recorded, and RESTV, although lethal to monkeys, is not known to cause human disease. 4 Given this variation in attributes, it is useful to compare the sequences among the envelope glycoproteins (GP), which are critical for viral cell entry and the primary target for antibody responses (elaborated below). Table 1 shows the amino acid similarity and identity among the GPs of the five Ebolavirus species; it is interesting to note that the two most pathogenic species (EBOV and SUDV) are the most distantly related. The prefusion X-ray structures for EBOV GP and SUDV GP have been reported and, although the greater topology of the GP spike remains quite similar, there are subtle variations. 5−7 Prefusion GP roughly consists of a chalice-and-bowl morphology, with GP1 comprising the bowl, which sits within the chalice formed by the GP2 subunits. 6, 7 In this prefusion structure, the GP2 fusion loop wraps around GP1. Ostensibly, the ""post-fusion"" structures of the fusion subunit (GP2) ectodomain for EBOV and MARV are the same, except for features of specific side chain−side chain interactions that give rise to pH-dependent stability. 8 The pathology of Ebola and Marburg viral disease (EVD or MVD) arises from the ability of filoviruses to rapidly proliferate in their hosts and overcome the immune response. Although the correlates for survival in humans have not been extensively documented, it appears that survivors of an infection with SUDV continue to produce GP-specific antibodies as late as 12 years postinfection. 9 In nonhuman primates (NHPs), protection from viral challenge afforded by convalescent antibody therapy or monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails appears to involve seroconversion of the surviving animals and production of endogenous GP-specific IgG in the range of 12 days postviral challenge. 56 Ebolaviruses and MARV have broad cellular tropism, but in natural infection macrophages and dendritic cells are the primary targets of infection. 10, 11 Infected macrophages are unable to stimulate a robust immune response and cause a ""cytokine storm"" that is proposed to be the primary cause of the blood-clotting abnormalities and vascular leakage characteristic of filovirus hemorrhagic fever. 12, 13 Damage to other tissues (e.g., liver, kidneys, vascular endothelia) is thought to contribute to hemorrhagic fever symptoms and to late-stage multiorgan failure. Thus, any agent that decreases the spread of the virus in early infection stages has the potential to act as a postexposure therapeutic or pre-exposure prophylactic."
Optimal fluid management in sepsis,"Sepsis clinically manifests as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. 1 Optimal fluid resuscitation is relevant for all sepsis patients, and perhaps it is most important for those with septic shock. Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greatest risk of mortality, and septic shock is clinically identified as sepsis patients with serum lactate level .2 mmol/L and who require vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure $ 65 mm Hg in the absence of hypovolemia. Sepsis is among the most common conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), accounting for up to half of all hospital deaths and being the third leading cause of death overall in the United States. 2","Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies for which treatment and resuscitation should begin immediately. The goals of fluid resuscitation for these patients are: a) to rapidly replace intravascular volume and restore tissue perfusion, and b) to minimize organ dysfunction through timely interventions that either halt or reverse the physiologic derangements. If hypoperfusion is present, at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given rapidly, and additional fluids should be guided by frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status, preferably using dynamic indices to indicate the likelihood of a beneficial response to fluid administration. Fluid administration should be targeted to achieve a MAP of at least 65 mm Hg, and to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate due to hypoperfusion. 3 Balanced crystalloids are the fluid of first choice for sepsis resuscitation based on ready availability and taking medication costs into account. Use of 0.9% saline compared to a balanced crystalloid, such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte, produces more kidney dysfunction and with a greater risk of dying. 4 The individual side effect profiles may best differentiate the natural and synthetic colloids. Albumin may be considered for administration to sepsis patients with refractory shock or who have received substantial amounts of crystalloid fluids, but should not be administered to patients with severe traumatic brain injury. 5 Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) products should not be administered to patients with sepsis because of increased risk of acute kidney injury and death. Gelatin solutions are not recommended in sepsis."
Severe Systemic Calciphylaxis in a Young Cat Abbreviations,"A 7-month-old female intact domestic shorthair/ British Blue crossbreed cat was referred to the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals (QMHA) of the Royal Veterinary College for further investigation of progressive lethargy preceded by 48 hours of mixed bowel diarrhea, moderate pyrexia (39.9°C; 103.8°F), and unproductive retching. Laboratory tests performed at the primary practice identified marked hypercalcemia (serum total calcium concentration). Despite treatment with IV fluids and potentiated amoxicillin, the cat deteriorated clinically, prompting referral. On presentation to the QMHA, the cat was dull but responsive with poor body condition (3.5/9) and pyrexia (39.2°C; 102.6°F). Firm white lingual plaques were observed (Fig 1) . Both kidneys were subjectively mildly enlarged. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. With the exception of the cat's decreased mentation, neurologic examination was considered normal. No neurologic deficits suggesting a structural intracranial lesion were found at any point throughout the time the cat was hospitalized, but the level of obtundation would wax and wane. No association between the cat's mentation and the treatments administered was apparent.","British Blue crossbreed cat was referred to the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals (QMHA) of the Royal Veterinary College for further investigation of progressive lethargy preceded by 48 hours of mixed bowel diarrhea, moderate pyrexia (39.9°C; 103.8°F), and unproductive retching.

Results obtained by capture immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG enzyme-linked immunoassay, real time 1-step polymerase chain reaction, and virus isolation showed that 33 (82.5%) of 40 patients were viremic. Airport fever screening can thus quickly identify imported dengue cases.","D engue viruses are arboviruses that cause substantial human disease in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, especially in urban and semiurban areas. Because of its high endemicity in many countries in the Western Pacific, Southeast Asia, and South American regions, dengue has become an important public health problem in most nations in these areas (1) . Dengue is not considered endemic in Taiwan, however, and the constant importation of dengue viruses from the neighboring Southeast Asian countries through close commercial links and air travel is believed to cause local outbreaks (2, 3) . Until now, local outbreaks, which are most frequent in the summer and fall, have each been caused by a single imported dengue virus strain that disappears when each outbreak ends. Because waves of relatively cold temperature of ≈10°C cause low mosquito density in winter, winter outbreaks are rare, with the exceptions of large outbreaks in 1915-1916, 1942-1943, 1987-1988, and 2001-2002 . Outbreaks occur mainly in southern Taiwan, where Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus coexist, and rarely occur in central and northern Taiwan, where only A. albopictus exist. The dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Taiwan are highly correlated with increasing age and secondary dengue virus infection (4; J-H Huang, unpub data)."
Generation and Characterization of Novel Human IRAS Monoclonal Antibodies,"Imidazoline receptors were first proposed by Bousquet et al., when they studied antihypertensive effect of clonidine. A strong candidate for I1R, known as imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS), has been cloned from human hippocampus. We reported that IRAS mediated agmatine-induced inhibition of opioid dependence in morphine-dependent cells. To elucidate the functional and structure properties of I1R, we developed the newly monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal hIRAS region including the PX domain (10-120aa) through immunization of BALB/c mice with the NusA-IRAS fusion protein containing an IRAS N-terminal (10-120aa). Stable hybridoma cell lines were established and monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized full-length IRAS proteins in their native state by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal antibodies stained in a predominantly punctate cytoplasmic pattern when applied to IRAS-transfected HEK293 cells by indirect immunofluorescence assays and demonstrated excellent reactivity in flow immunocytometry. These monoclonal antibodies will provide powerful reagents for the further investigation of hIRAS protein functions.","Imidazoline receptors were first proposed by Bousquet et al., when they studied antihypertensive effect of clonidine [1] . Based on their physiologic and pharmacological properties, imidazoline receptors are classified into three main types: I1R, I2R, and I3R [2] [3] [4] . I1R and I2R have been implicated in hypertension and psychiatric disorder regulation, respectively, while I3R may be involved in insulin secretion [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Compared with mitochondrial I2R, which resides within the monoamine oxidase protein [10] , the clonidine-preferring imidazoline binding sites (known as I1R) are localized to plasma membrane fractions [11, 12] and specifically to synaptic plasma membranes [13] ."
Trex1 regulates lysosomal biogenesis and interferon- independent activation of antiviral genes,"Innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids triggers type I interferon (IFN) production, which activates interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and directs a multifaceted antiviral response. ISGs can also be activated through IFN-independent pathways, although the precise mechanisms remain","elusive. Here we found that the cytosolic exonuclease Trex1 regulates the activation of a subset of ISGs independently of IFN. Both Trex1 −/− mouse and TREX1-mutant human cells express high levels of antiviral genes and are refractory to viral infections. The IFN-independent activation of antiviral genes in Trex1 −/− cells requires STING, TBK1 and IRF3 and IRF7. We also found that Trex1-deficient cells display expanded lysosomal compartment, altered subcellular localization of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), and reduced mTORC1 activity. Together, our data identify Trex1 as a regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and IFN-independent activation of antiviral genes, and shows dysregulation of lysosomes can elicit innate immune responses."
"Invasive bacterial infections following influenza: a time-series analysis in Montré al, Canada, 1996-2008","Background Shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related.","At the time of the 1889 influenza pandemic, there was still much uncertainty about the disease being infectious 1 but after the discovery of Haemophilus influenzae by Pfeiffer in 1892, the belief in its bacterial aetiology became widespread. 2 However, invasive bacterial infections have been recognized as complications of influenza at least since the 1918 pandemic 3,4 when some, like Goodpasture, believed the disease itself to be 'caused by an unknown virus'. 5 Bacteria were well confirmed as secondary invaders by the 1930s. 6 The association between viral and subsequent bacterial infections result from a great variety of mechanisms, including the breakdown of physical barriers, increased bacterial adhesion, increased apoptosis of antibacterial immune cells and decreased phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. 7 Specifically, there is evidence that the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus promotes the internalization Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-haemolytic streptococci) 8 and that the neuraminidase promotes the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae to human respiratory cells. 9 At a population level, over several decades and in various populations, strong and consistent associations have been found between influenza and secondary pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, 10 S. pyogenes and Hemophilus influenzae, 10, 11 and also with mortality. This applies to seasonal 6, 12 and pandemic 10 influenza A, including the 2009 pH1N1 strain, 13 and to influenza B. 6 About 95% of deaths associated with influenza are considered to be caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia, the susceptibility to which is thought to peak 1-2 weeks after exposure to influenza. 11, 14 However, the peak may be later for pneumococcal infections, up to 4 weeks in adults and 8 weeks in children.

Structural Basis for the Identification of the N-Terminal Domain of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein as an Antiviral Target,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause numerous diseases, including Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, generating significant healthrelated and economic consequences. CoVs encode the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a major structural protein that plays multiple roles in the virus replication cycle and forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with the viral RNA through the N protein's N-terminal domain (N-NTD). Using human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) as a model for CoV, we present the 3D structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with ribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates to identify a distinct ribonucleotide-binding pocket. By targeting this pocket, we identified and developed a new coronavirus N protein inhibitor, N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)(N,N-dimethylamino)acetamide hydrochloride (PJ34), using virtual screening; this inhibitor reduced the N protein's RNA-binding affinity and hindered viral replication. We also determined the crystal structure of the N-NTD−PJ34 complex. On the basis of these findings, we propose guidelines for developing new N protein-based antiviral agents that target CoVs.","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of RNA viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes that cause various upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both humans and animals. 1, 2 The human coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E) were identified in the 1960s. 3 Between 2003 and 2004, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a worldwide epidemic and had a significant economic impact in the countries affected by the outbreak. 4 In 2004, another alphacoronavirus (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. 5 In 2005, Woo et al. discovered the novel betacoronavirus HKU1 in patients with respiratory tract infections. 6 Recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was found in patients with severe acute respiratory tract infections in the Middle East.

Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (,"Abstract Studying membrane active peptides or protein fragments within the lipid bilayer environment is particularly challenging in the case of synthetically modified, labeled, artificial, or recently discovered native structures. For such samples the localization and orientation of the molecular species or probe within the lipid bilayer environment is the focus of research prior to an evaluation of their dynamic or mechanistic behavior. X-ray scattering is a powerful method to study peptide/lipid interactions in the fluid, fully hydrated state of a lipid bilayer. For one, the lipid response can be revealed by observing membrane thickening and thinning as well as packing in the membrane plane; at the same time, the distinct positions of peptide moieties within lipid membranes can be elucidated at resolutions of up to several angstroms by applying heavy-atom labeling techniques. In this study, we describe a generally applicable X-ray scattering approach that provides robust and quantitative information about peptide insertion and localization as well as peptide/lipid interaction within highly oriented, hydrated multilamellar membrane stacks. To this end, we have studied an artificial, designed b-helical peptide motif in its homodimeric and hairpin variants adopting different states of oligomerization. These peptide lipid complexes were analyzed by grazing incidence diffraction (GID) to monitor changes in the lateral lipid packing and ordering. In addition, we have applied anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation as well as in-house X-ray reflectivity in combination with iodine-labeling in order to determine the electron density distribution q(z) along the membrane normal (z axis), and thereby reveal the hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as the position of certain amino acid side chains within the lipid bilayer. In the case of multiple labeling, the latter technique is not only applicable to demonstrate the peptide's reconstitution but also to generate evidence about the relative peptide orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer."

Hospital Resource Utilization and Patient Outcomes Associated with Respiratory Viral Testing in Hospitalized Patients,"Testing patients for respiratory viruses should guide isolation precautions and provide a rationale for antimicrobial drug therapies, but few studies have evaluated these assumptions. To determine the association between viral testing, patient outcomes, and care processes, we identified adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from 2004 through 2012 at a large, academic, tertiary hospital in Canada. Viral testing was performed in 11% (2,722/24,567) of hospital admissions and was not associated with reduced odds for death (odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.10) or longer length of stay (+1 day for those tested). Viral testing resulted in more resource utilization, including intensive care unit admission, but positive test results were not associated with less antibiotic use or shorter duration of isolation. Results suggest that health care providers do not use viral test results in making management decisions at this hospital. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of respiratory infection control policies.","I n 2003, the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak infected 774 and killed 8,096 persons worldwide (1) . It was quickly recognized that this virus spread between close contacts, because 21% of infected case-patients were health care workers caring for patients infected with the SARS coronavirus (1, 2) . During the outbreak, respiratory infection control policies were developed by clinical infectious disease and public health experts, and their use was mandated in all Canadian hospitals. These measures were attributed to the eventual control of the outbreak (3) (4) (5) (6) . As a result, infection control practices, including strict hand hygiene, viral testing of patient samples, and use of isolation precautions, quarantine rooms, and personal protective equipment, were mandated for routine use with all patients who sought treatment at emergency departments (EDs) with respiratory symptoms and fever (7, 8) ."
"Signalling C-Type lectin receptors, microbial recognition and immunity","Signalling C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are crucial in shaping the immune response to fungal pathogens, but comparably little is known about the role of these receptors in bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. CLRs have many diverse functions depending on the signalling motifs in their cytoplasmic domains, and can induce endocytic, phagocytic, antimicrobial, pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses which are either protective or not during an infection. Understanding the role of CLRs in shaping anti-microbial immunity offers great potential for the future development of therapeutics for disease intervention. In this review we will focus on the recognition of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens by CLRs, and how these receptors influence the outcome of infection. We will also provide a brief update on the role of CLRs in antifungal immunity. Received ","The innate immune system provides the first line of defence against microbial attack, and is induced by recognition of microbial components, known as pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or microbialassociated molecular patterns (MAMPs), by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PAMPs are highly conserved and generally unique to microbes (Akira et al., 2006) . Fungal PAMPs consist primarily of cell wall carbohydrate structures, while bacterial PAMPS range from lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin and peptidoglycan to bacterial nucleic acid structures. Viruses on the other hand are mainly recognized through their nucleic acids, such as double (dsRNA) or single stranded-RNA (ssRNA) and viral DNA, although surface envelope glycoproteins can also be recognized. Although the PAMPs are not as well characterized, parasites, particularly helminths such as Schistosoma mansoni and Trichuris muris, or protozoa, such as Leishmania infantum and Plasmodium berghei, are also recognized by mammalian PRRs (McGuinness et al., 2003; Broz and Monack, 2013; Drummond and Brown, 2013) ."

Article focus Hip,We report a systematic review and metaanalysis of the performance of blood metal ion testing for adverse reactions to metal debris (ARmDs) in patients with metal-on-metal (mom) hip implants.,"Despite the fact that total hip arthroplasty (tHA) has been touted as the operation of the 21st century, orthopaedic researchers continue to propose new designs in an effort to improve implant longevity and patient function. 1 one such purported improvement was the use of a large femoral head with a metal-on-metal (mom) bearing; this design failed and has become a significant public health concern leading to withdrawal and even recall of certain implant designs. 2, 3 this is yet another example of the flawed cycle of innovation in arthroplasty where new implants actually underperform relative to the existing standard. 4 this alarm over mom hip implants stems from reported high failure rates, and the potential for locally aggressive ion-induced local tissue reactions such as pseudotumours, a type of adverse reaction to metal debris (ARmD). 5 It has been estimated that over a million patients have received these implants worldwide, thus posing a significant concern in regard to monitoring and advising patients on both short and long term performance. 5 In the 1980s, mom bearings were introduced as an improvement on standard metal-on-polyethylene (mop) bearings. mom bearings generate less volumetric wear which may translate into longer implant survival. 6 In addition, mom bearings facilitate greater hip stability and range of movement from larger head sizes. Furthermore, mom bearings allow for bone-conserving hip resurfacing (HR) which is important for younger patients who will eventually require revision surgery. 7 Both mop and mom bearings have been associated with elevated systemic levels of metal ions and ARmDs, however, ion levels have been shown to be consistently higher in patients with mom bearings, and ARmDs appear to be more common in these patients. [8] [9] [10] [11] ARmDs span a spectrum of aseptic necrotic effusions that include pseudotumours as well as aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesions (Alvl) (pericapsular hypersensitivity reactions associated with osteolysis). [12] [13] [14] When patients present with mechanical symptoms or pain following a mom hip implant, unlike with a mop hip implant, expectant management may not be advisable due to the potential for ARmD lesions which can lead to progressive tissue destruction that compromises reconstructive options. [15] [16] [17] As these lesions are diagnosed with ultrasound (US) or metal artefact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging (mARS mRI), there has been interest in developing an inexpensive and rapid laboratory test. 18 Government agencies worldwide have published recommendations on the surveillance and work-up of patients with mom hip implants. the United Kingdom's medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency 2012), 19 22 and the therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (therapeutic Goods Administration 2012) 23 have recommended close followup of patients, even those with well-functioning implants. Surveillance with metal ions has been recommended for patients with the ASR implant (Depuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana) in the United Kingdom, with large-diameter tHA and small-diameter hip resurfacing (HR) in Australia, and with large-diameter tHA and any HR in europe. the recommended work-up of symptomatic patients by each of these organisations includes blood metal ion assessment. to date, the most detailed guidelines were put forth by the United Kingdom's medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency which advised that a blood metal ion level > 7 µg/l indicates potential for soft-tissue reaction. As noted by others, ion level cut-offs are arbitrary and not supported by scientific data. 5, [24] [25] [26] Given the uncertain utility of laboratory testing in surveillance and investigation of patients with mom hip implants, there is a need to synthesise the evidence for the measurement of blood cobalt and chromium ion concentrations. In this paper we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the screening and diagnostic value of metal ion testing for ARmDs."

These interactions are crucial for most cellular processes, so the full representation of the interaction repertoire is needed to understand the cell molecular machinery at the system biology level. In this short review, we compare various methods for predicting protein-protein interactions using sequence and structure information. The ultimate goal of those approaches is to present the complete methodology for the automatic selection of interaction partners using their amino acid sequences and/or three dimensional structures, if known. Apart from a description of each method, details of the software or web interface needed for high throughput prediction on the whole genome scale are also provided. The proposed validation of the theoretical methods using experimental data would be a better assessment of their accuracy.","Interactions between proteins are crucial for most of the molecular processes in cells. Therefore, identifying the full interaction repertoire, the so-called protein interaction network, will yield a better understanding of the cellular machinery on the molecular level. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches is needed to accomplish this goal. Large-scale experiments allow massive amounts of data to be gathered and interacting proteins to be characterized, even if the data is partial or inaccurate. It is essential to carefully select the most important pairs of interacting proteins to properly interpret such experimental results, i.e. observed protein interaction networks. The term Interactome describes the set of all molecular interactions in a cell, especially in the context of protein-protein interactions. The whole interactome is often presented as a graph with nodes denoting interacting partners and edges representing interactions. In order to properly understand the molecular interactions, one has to start by analyzing interacting pairs of proteins in terms of their structure and sequence. Recent advances in bioinformatics tools and resources allow for a wider view of a protein and its biological context or physico-chemical properties. Thanks to the structural genomic initiative of the last decade, more and more protein sequences and their three-dimensional structures are known, giving rise to large publicly available databases. Furthermore, many experimental laboratories are performing more detailed experimental analyses of protein functions, yielding small but specialized databases. The most important goal of bioinformatics is integrating these experimental resources, developing computational methods based on these databases, and providing access to this converted information to a wider research audience. The integration of various resources into a single, publicly available metadatabase would allow for the easy extraction of valuable biological information from the massive amount of accumulated data. Moreover, the recent advances in theoretical methodology have been a crucial step into a systematic understanding of the molecular machinery. Most methods for the prediction of protein-protein interactions use sequence information to train various supervised machine learning algorithms. Three-dimensional structures acquired from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [1] are also used to improve the accuracy of predictions. Further advances are possible when the genomic context, and predicted or known functional annotation of any interaction partners are taken into account. The number of crystallographically solved (known) structures is much smaller than the number of protein sequences. Therefore, most protein-protein interaction prediction methods neglect the three-dimensional details, focusing instead on sequence analysis. Major advances in the field of protein structure prediction allow the introduction of a complementary approach that will use predicted 3D models together with sequence features in order to correctly pair potentially interacting proteins. For instance, the MetaBASIC algorithm developed by Ginalski et al. [2] compares the sequence profiles of two proteins enriched by their predicted secondary structures. Such alignments of query sequences with proteins of known structure allow for quick mean resolution 3D model creation and optimization. The prediction of protein-protein interactions is a difficult problem when an analysis of both the protein sequences and known three-dimensional structures is needed. There are at least two reasons for that. Firstly, the number of possible interactions that have to be taken into account is extremely large. In yeast cells, one would have to analyze a possible 18,000,000 interactions between 6,000 proteins encoded in its genome, not counting multiple variants of gene products coming from alternative splicing or post-translational modifications. Only a small portion of those pairs is actually present in cells [3, 4] . Secondly, there are several types of possible interactions in living cells, from stable complexes up to temporary, functional pairings (for example, during the phosphorylation process in response to external stimuli). Protein complexes are better preserved during the evolution process than single proteins, so some computational methods focus on the prediction or searching of complexes that are common to several species [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Those methods use available information about experimentally verified interactions between proteins, orthologies, and comparison of protein sequences [13] . This review outlines recent advances in the field of protein-protein interaction prediction, and introduces some ideas about the application of structural modeling to improve the accuracy of these approaches. Such rapid methods allow the whole proteomes of various organisms to be scanned. By improving selection accuracy, computational methods help in the discovery of true interactions within the experimental data, which contains many false positives. Thus, the ultimate goal of system biology, i.e. to draw and understand the real interactome, is close to being achieved."
"No Effect of a Homeopathic Preparation on Neonatal Calf Diarrhoea in a Randomised Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial","Verdier de K, Öhagen P, Alenius S: No effect of a homeopathic preparation on neonatal calf diarrhoea in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Acta vet. scand. 2003, 44, 97-101. -A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a homeopathic treatment of neonatal calf diarrhoea was performed using 44 calves in 12 dairy herds. Calves with spontaneously derived diarrhoea were treated with either the homeopathic remedy Podophyllum (D30) (n=24) or a placebo (n=20). No clinically or statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was demonstrated. Calves treated with Podophyllum had an average of 3.1 days of diarrhoea compared with 2.9 days for the placebo group. Depression, inappetence and fever were presented equally in the 2 groups. These results support the widely held opinion that scientific proof for the efficacy of veterinary homeopathy is lacking. In the European Union this implies a considerable risk for animal welfare, since in some countries priority is given to homeopathic treatments in organic farming.","Acute undifferentiated diarrhoea in young calves (neonatal calf diarrhoea) is a daily occurrence all over the world, and rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum and coronavirus are major aetiological agents. In the European Union, veterinary homeopathy is in common use in field practice, including for calf diarrhoea, and in some countries is increasing in popularity. Homeopathy may be defined as the treatment of animals that have signs of disease with a diluted and specially prepared substance that, in sufficient quantity in a healthy animal, would cause the same clinical signs. The existing literature on the subject comprises studies on various diseases and, although it is claimed that experimental and clin-ical evidence supports the use of homeopathy in some situations (see, for example Wynn 1998), more than 200 years in practice have not rendered convincing proof of its efficacy. In cattle, there is limited literature on the use of homeopathy. The study design in the trials is a matter of debate, e.g. in the reviews of clinical trials on homeopathic treatment of mastitis by Hamann (1992) and Vaarst (1996) . Clinical trials on calves have been reported, e.g. by Taylor et. al. (1989) , who found no discernible differences between the treated and control groups in their manifestation of resistance to bovine lungworm or their clinical responses to the disease produced, by Vohla (1991), who found no effect on calf health after homeopathic treatment of their dams with periparturient diseases, and by Kayne & Rafferty (1994) , who claimed effect on calf diarrhoea by Arsenicum album C30, although the results were not statistically valid. To make interpretation of results possible, trials need to be double-blind and placebo-controlled, and the use of relevant statistical analyses should be made. Currently it is difficult to assess the efficacy of homeopathy from the present literature (Persson Waller et al. 1998) , and therefore scientific evaluation of the effect of homeopathic treatment is required as a matter of urgency. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the homeopathic remedy Podophyllum on the duration and clinical course of neonatal calf diarrhoea."
Effectiveness of Neuraminidase Inhibitors for Preventing Staff Absenteeism during Pandemic Influenza,"We used a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposedinfectious-removed) meta-population model, together with scenario, sensitivity, and simulation analyses, to determine stockpiling strategies for neuraminidase inhibitors that would minimize absenteeism among healthcare workers. A pandemic with a basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2.5 resulted in peak absenteeism of 10%. Treatment decreased peak absenteeism to 8%, while 8 weeks' prophylaxis reduced it to 2%. For pandemics with higher R 0 , peak absenteeism exceeded 20% occasionally and 6 weeks' prophylaxis reduced peak absenteeism by 75%. Insufficient duration of prophylaxis increased peak absenteeism compared with treatment only. Earlier pandemic detection and initiation of prophylaxis may render shorter prophylaxis durations ineffective. Eight weeks' prophylaxis substantially reduced peak absenteeism under a broad range of assumptions for severe pandemics (peak absenteeism >10%). Small investments in treatment and prophylaxis, if adequate and timely, can reduce absenteeism among essential staff.","C oncerns regarding the advent and impact of the next influenza pandemic have led >120 countries to develop pandemic preparedness plans (1) . Studies have shown that treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and prophylaxis of selected subpopulations are cost-effective strategies to limit the pandemic's impact on the healthcare system (2, 3) . However, supplies of neuraminidase inhibitors are limited, and countries may not have the financial resources to purchase large stockpiles. Policymakers will thus have to determine priorities for treatment and prophylaxis."
Studies on Calf Diarrhoea in Mozambique: Prevalence of Bacterial Pathogens,"Achá SJ, Kühn I, Jonsson P, Mbazima G, Katouli M, Möllby R: Studies on calf diarrhoea in Mozambique: Prevalence of bacterial pathogens. Acta vet. scand. 2004, 45, 27-36.","Cattle rearing is a tradition in Mozambique. It plays an important role to the country's economy and social welfare. Because of the presence of Tse-Tse fly in the central and northern parts of the country the cattle population is mainly concentrated to southern provinces. Among the factors, which have been hindering cattle production in Mozambique, mortality of calves is one that causes major concern. Presence of infectious agents, poor management and poor nutrition are some of the factors which can be pointed out as causes of calf disease and mortality. However, there is a lack of data on the role of infectious disease in calf morbidity and mortality in Mozambique. The common conditions affecting calves are merely described as diarrhoea and/or pneumonia without identification of their aetiology. The number of cases of diarrhoea is normally higher during the rainy seasons, from October/November to March than during the dry seasons, from March to October. Diarrhoea in calves can be caused by a variety of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and intestinal parasites. Among bacteria, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Salmonella are known to be the most common and economically important agents (House 1978) , but other bacteria, e.g. Campylobacter spp. have also been identified as cause of enteric disease and diarrhoea in calves (Firehammer & Myers 1981 , Prescott & Munroe 1982 , Myers et al. 1984 . The 2 latter groups also contain important human pathogens that may cause outbreaks of food-borne diseases (De Rycke et al. 1986 ) and thus are of high public health importance. In acute neonatal diarrhoea, an important disease of calves, 4 micro-organisms in particular, are of widespread occurrence and proven enteropathogenicity: rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidia and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) (Acres et al. 1975 , Morin et al. 1976 , Moon et al. 1978 . Two of the more prominent virulence factors identified for ETEC strains are (i) expression of fimbrial (pili) antigens that enables the bacteria to adhere to and to colonise the luminal surface of the small bowel and (ii) elaboration of one or more enterotoxins that influence intestinal secretion of fluids (Holland 1990 ). The most common observed fimbriae on ETEC from calves with diarrhoea are F5, also named K99 and F41, but strains with F165 fimbriae have also been isolated (Contrepois et al. 1989) . K99 antigen is a fimbrial adhesin distinct from the capsular polysaccharide K antigens (Orskov et al. 1975) . Two biological classes of enterotoxins are produced by ETEC: heat labile (LT) and heat stable (STa and STb) (Gaastra & de Graaf 1982 , Holmgren 1985 , Scotland et al. 1985 . Most bovine ETEC produce STa enterotoxin and K99 fimbriae (Moon et al. 1976 , Kaeckenbeeck 1981 . The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of diarrhoea in dairy farms in Mozambique and the prevalence of Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni and ETEC in diarrhoeic and healthy calves. We were also interested to investigate the prevalence of fimbrial antigen K99 among the E. coli isolates."
Discovering human history from stomach bacteria,comment reviews reports deposited research interactions information refereed research Abstract Recent analyses of human pathogens have revealed that their evolutionary histories are congruent with the hypothesized pattern of ancient and modern human population migrations.,"Charles Darwin recognized that the distribution and form of parasites was evolutionarily significant. He noted, for instance, that ""... the Pediculi [lice] collected in different countries from the different races of man ... differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of their claws and limbs. In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant"" [1] . More recently, several research groups [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] have found interesting correlations between the evolutionary relationships among various bacterial and viral strains hosted by humans and the pattern of migrations of modern humans throughout the world."

Robust and accurate diagnostics are essential tools for identifying those who are at risk and in need of treatment in low-resource settings. Inorganic complexes and metal-based nanomaterials continue to drive the development of diagnostic platforms and strategies that enable infectious disease detection in low-resource settings. In this review, we highlight works from the past 20 years in which inorganic chemistry and nanotechnology were implemented in each of the core components that make up a diagnostic test. First, we present how inorganic biomarkers and their properties are leveraged for infectious disease detection. In the following section, we detail metal-based technologies that have been employed for sample preparation and biomarker isolation from sample matrices. We then describe how inorganic-and nanomaterial-based probes have been utilized in point-ofcare diagnostics for signal generation. The following section discusses instrumentation for signal readout in resource-limited settings. Next, we highlight the detection of nucleic acids at the point of care as an emerging application of inorganic chemistry. Lastly, we consider the challenges that remain for translation of the aforementioned diagnostic platforms to low-resource settings.","In 1906, William Osler, one of the founders of modern American medicine, stated, ""Diagnosis, not drugging, is our chief weapon of offence."" 1 Despite the medical advances of the 20th and 21st centuries, infectious diseases remain major global health issues and continue to claim millions of lives each year in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). 2−4 As the global community moves toward control and elimination of infectious disease, it has become evident that there is a pressing need for diagnostic strategies that can be applied in primary health care settings. 5−7 This review shines a spotlight on how the applied uses of inorganic chemistry advance the concepts of metals-in-medicine beyond therapeutics and vaccines and into the realm of diagnostics, enabling new tools to meet these global challenges."
"MERS-CoV Antibody Responses 1 Year after Symptom Onset, South Korea, 2015 EID Podcast: Unraveling the Mysteries of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus",Visit our website to listen: http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/player.asp?f=8631627,"We investigated the kinetics of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) neutralizing and spike protein antibody titers over the course of 1 year in 11 patients who were confirmed by reverse transcription PCR to have been infected during the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Robust antibody responses were detected in all survivors who had severe disease; responses remained detectable, albeit with some waning, for <1 year. The duration of viral RNA detection (but not viral load) in sputum significantly correlated with the antibody response magnitude. The MERS S1 ELISA antibody titers correlated well with the neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients who had mild illness were undetectable even though most had evidence of pneumonia. This finding implies that MERS-CoV seroepidemiologic studies markedly underestimate the extent of mild and asymptomatic infection. Obtaining convalescent-phase plasma with high antibody titers to treat MERS will be challenging."

Typical real-time TC delivery traces measured using Cy3-R and Cy5-L11 (A) or Cy3-F and Cy5-L11 (B), for ribosomes programmed with mPL in the absence of EF-G·GTP. Cy3 fluorescence (Green) and sensitized emission of Cy5 (FRET, Blue) were collected under 532 nm excitation. Preformed POST E (1) or POST R (4) with Cy5-L11 were immobilized in flow chambers in A and B, respectively. Camera recording was started 5 seconds prior to injection of Cy3 labeled tRNA TC and continued for 1 minute at 33 ms integration time per frame. Dwell time distributions of POST E complexes (C, 1) and POST R complexes (D, 4) were measured from the injection until the appearance of steady Cy3 and FRET intensities. (E and F).

The map is a two-dimensional density plot of transitions identified by a Hidden Markov Modeling algorithm (HaMMy), indicating FRET efficiencies before vs. after each transition. This plot demonstrates that FRET transitions are unidirectional, as from 0.07 to 0.66, from 0.66 to 0.40, and from 0.40 to 0.78, which were assigned to complexes 2 → 3, 3 → 4-5, and 4-5 → 6 as explained in the main text.

All traces are aligned to the beginning of the last FRET state (mean 0.78) as t = 0. Decreasing concentration of Phe TC (A vs. B) mainly increases the dwell time of the 0.40 and 0.66 FRET states; whereas the pseudoknot mRNA (C) structure mainly increases the dwell time of the 0.78 FRET state.","Changes in proflavin fluorescence after rapid mixing PRE complexes containing fMetValPheArg-tRNA Arg (prf) in the A-site with EF-G·GTP.

Quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy,"Previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood.","Thyroid carcinomas often recur many years after surgery (Loh et al, 1997) . The monitoring of serum thyroglobulin (TG) by immunoassay can be used in detecting residual or recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) after total thyroidectomy. However, the usefulness of this method is limited by both the requirement for thyroid hormone withdrawal to attain optimal sensitivity and interference by antithyroglobulin antibodies (Singer et al, 1996) . Recent reports have demonstrated that the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to detect circulating cancer cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies such as prostate cancer (Ghossein et al, 1995) and neuroblastoma (Mattano et al, 1992) ."

Long-term Effects of Providing Healthcare for SARS Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) found the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to be stressful, but the long-term impact is not known. From 13 to 26 months after the SARS outbreak, 769 HCWs at 9 Toronto hospitals that treated SARS patients and 4 Hamilton hospitals that did not treat SARS patients completed a survey of several adverse outcomes. Toronto HCWs reported significantly higher levels of burnout (p = 0.019), psychological distress (p<0.001), and posttraumatic stress (p<0.001). Toronto workers were more likely to have reduced patient contact and work hours and to report behavioral consequences of stress. Variance in adverse outcomes was explained by a protective effect of the perceived adequacy of training and support and by a provocative effect of maladaptive coping style and other individual factors. The results reinforce the value of effective staff support and training in preparation for future outbreaks.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged from Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China, in November 2002 and spread rapidly; transmission occurred primarily in hospitals, often to healthcare workers (HCWs). Although initially virtually no literature was available to guide expectations of how an emerging infection would affect the psychological well-being of hospital staff (1) , by the summer of 2003 the acute psychological impact of SARS had been widely studied. Significant emotional distress was present in 18%-57% of HCWs (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) and was associated with quarantine (7), fear of contagion (6, 8, 9) , concern for family (5, 9, 10) , job stress (6, 9) , interpersonal isolation (6, 9) , perceived stigma (6, 7, 11) , conscription of nonspecialists into infectious disease work (12) , and attachment insecurity (10) ."
BMC Medical Genetics Association of HLA class I with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.

"Drug Design, Development and Therapy T10B9 monoclonal antibody: A short-acting nonstimulating monoclonal antibody that spares γδ T-cells and treats and prevents cellular rejection","T10B9.1A-31/MEDI-500 is a nonmitogenic immunoglobulin M kappa murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the alpha-beta (αβ) heterodimer of the T-lymphocyte receptor complex. The hybridoma was first produced by fusing spleen cells from BALB/C mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2/O-Ag14 mutant myeloma cells. The mAb is produced and purified using multistep ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography protocols. T10B9 has been used successfully to treat acute cellular rejection in renal transplantation and as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Because T10B9 is nonmitogenic and causes minimal cytokine release, both treatment of rejection and induction of immunosuppression were accomplished with significantly fewer and milder untoward effects (cytokine release syndrome) than its comparator OKT3. Since T10B9 is directed against the αβ heterodimer of the CD3 epitope, it spares the gamma delta (γδ) region. These gamma delta (γδ) T cells have a unique role in the immune response controlling many serious human diseases and perhaps facilitating the development of immunologic tolerance. T10B9 has a relatively short duration of action, depleting T cells for only 10 to 14 days, unlike the protracted depletion seen with thymoglobulin and Campath-1H. There is no B-lymphocyte depletion with T10B9 as there is with both of the aforementioned reagents. The lack of prolonged lymphocyte depletion may account for less infection observed with T10B9 treatment.","Induction of immunosuppression has become a standard therapy in the United States with over 70% of transplantation programs using agents to inhibit the first rejection response. The drugs most often used fall into three categories; 1) the interleukin-2 anti-CD25 selective blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as basiliximab and daclizumab, 2) polyclonal antisera against T-lymphocytes such as rabbit antilymphocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) or 3) the mAb alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) which targets T and B cells. The latter two agents have significant effects on B-cells. After an initial dose of 30 mg, Campath-1H profoundly suppresses T-cells for up to 330 days and B-cells for 90 to 150 days. Thymoglobulin significantly suppresses T-cells for up to 90 days and has a profound anti-B-cell effect from 15 to 980 days, opening many windows for opportunistic infection. (Figure 1 ). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Clearly there would be an advantage for a shorter acting immunosuppression agent which allows T-cell recovery, has little or no effect on B cells and, therefore, does not produce profound long-term immunosuppression. Waid Dovepress OKT3, the first mAb shown to be effective in treating acute cellular rejection, is such a short-acting agent; however, it causes significant adverse events including those related to its mitogenicity and marked stimulation of inflammatory cytokines. T10B9.1A-31/MEDI-500 is a short-acting but murine immunoglobulin M kappa (IgMκ) mAb that is nonmitogenic in vitro which was developed at the University of Kentucky. The purpose of this review is to discuss T10B9.1A-31 (T10B9) briefly describing its manufacturing process, state its known mechanism of action with comparison to OKT3, give a synopsis of T10B9's clinical efficacy, discuss the ability of T10B9 therapy to spare γδ T cells which may be important in infection and in the development of tolerance; and finally to support the thesis that a shorter acting more selective anti-T-lymphocyte monoclonal antibody may be a better choice for induction of immunosuppression and/or treatment of acute rejection."
Long-Term Stability Monitoring of Printed Proteins on Paper-Based Membranes,"Monitoring of long-term stability of proteins on paper-based membranes is important as it is directly related to paper-based sensor fabrication. By using a simple piezo printhead inkjet printer, recombinant proteins and antibodies were printed on paper-based membranes to test their stability and sensitivity under varying lengths of storage and temperature conditions. Our data show that a printed IgG-HRP antibody on simple printing paper maintains >50% functionality up to ∼2 months under 4 and −20°C storage. Antibodies printed on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and nitrocellulose showed 5.3 and 9.7% decreases, respectively, in initial signal intensities compared to printing paper. Prostate-specific membrane antigen and tumor necrosis factor alpha recombinant proteins printed on paper-based membranes can be detected by antibodies, and antibody signal intensities can be detected up to 28 days after storage at 4 and −20°C when printed on PVDF membrane or printing paper. These data suggest that printed proteins on simple printing paper and PVDF membrane can maintain their functionality up to few months when stored at 4°C or lower and can be potentially applied in paper-based sensor development.","Detection and sensing of viruses, pollutants, and other related proteins have received much attention with the Zika and MERS outbursts in recent years. 1−5 To be considered a good detection and sensing platform, stability and detection sensitivity as well as ease of use and maintenance should be guaranteed. 6, 7 There are several careful studies of paper-based sensing membranes that provide a cheap and convenient option for virus/pollutant detection. 8−12 To date, a large number of novel paper-based sensing technologies, including nanoparticle-based and electronic-based sensors, have been developed to increase detection sensitivity. 13−16 However, many of these technologies require a significant amount of detection time, function only under certain storage conditions and are quite often expensive. As alternatives to these high technology sensing platforms, colorimetric and immunosensors are still popular in clinical use. 17−19 These immunosensors are based on immobilized capturing antibodies, and virus particles/antigens captured on antibodies were detected by detection antibodies. 20, 21 Colorimetric/immunosensing platforms are widely used in various viruses, antigens, and pollutant detection systems; however, most of the studies of these paper-based sensors focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage conditions. 22 −24 In addition, a large number of paper-based sensing membrane systems have adopted chemically treated membranes to enhance protein/ antibody adsorption and stability, 25−27 but comparative studies of protein stability and detection sensitivity on different paperbased membranes are rare. To verify the stability of printed proteins on paper-based membranes and to fill the gaps in research, we conducted systematic studies of protein stability and sensitivity on three different paper-based membranes. We also conducted long-term monitoring of printed proteins/ antibodies on paper-based platforms with varying storage temperature conditions to identify an optimal storing period and temperature for printed proteins."
Viral Infection Triggers Central Nervous System Autoimmunity Via Activation of Dual TCR-Expressing CD8 + T Cells HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, central nervous system disease mediated by myelin-specific T cells. Environmental triggers that cause a breakdown of myelinspecific T cell tolerance are unknown. We found that CD8 + myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell tolerance can be broken and autoimmunity induced by infection with a virus that does not express MBP cross-reactive epitopes and does not depend on bystander activation. Instead, the virus activated dual T cell receptor (TCR)-expressing T cells capable of recognizing both MBP and viral antigens. These results demonstrate the importance of dual TCR T cells in autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected individuals, as hypothesized in the etiology of MS.","higher in MS patients compared to healthy controls3. Furthermore, depletion of CD4 + T cells was not beneficial in MS patients, while depletion of a broader spectrum of leukocytes, including both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, reduced lesion formation and relapses4. Together these observations support a role for both CD4 + and CD8 + myelin-specific T cells in the pathogenesis of MS."

Pandemic Infl uenza Planning in the United States from a Health Disparities Perspective Search past Issues,"We explored how different socioeconomic and racial/ ethnic groups in the United States might fare in an infl uenza pandemic on the basis of social factors that shape exposure, vulnerability to infl uenza virus, and timeliness and adequacy of treatment. We discuss policies that might differentially affect social groups' risk for illness or death. Our purpose is not to establish the precise magnitude of disparities likely to occur; rather, it is to call attention to avoidable disparities that can be expected in the absence of systematic attention to differential social risks in pandemic preparedness plans. Policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels should consider potential sources of socioeconomic and racial/ ethnic disparities during a pandemic and formulate specifi c plans to minimize these disparities.","T he threat of pandemic infl uenza has generated concern among politicians, policy makers, healthcare professionals, and the general public. For the past several centuries, major infl uenza pandemics have occurred every 10 to 30 years (1); it is widely believed that a new pandemic is ""inevitable"" (2) . The possibility of an imminent infl uenza pandemic has been heightened by the appearance and spread of avian infl uenza A (H5N1), which has a case-fatality ratio of >50% (3) . Although the assumption has been that avian infl uenza viruses could not directly infect humans, the transmission of infl uenza virus (H5N1) directly from chickens to humans in 1997 caused experts to reconsider that assumption (4) . Genetic changes in infl uenza virus subtype H5N1 in 2003 resulted in a new strain of the virus, which spread to multiple countries in East and Southeast Asia (5) , as well as Europe and Africa. Whether the avian infl uenza virus (H5N1) develops human pandemic potential, its spread from birds to humans and the severity of the resulting disease have heightened concerns about a possible future infl uenza pandemic."

,282 ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; DHEA(S) = dehydroepiandrosterone (sulphate); NO = nitric oxide.,"The search for the marker in sepsis and inflammation continues. Perhaps when we do find it we may be able to alter and influence the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis. Many reports from those who believe that this may lie in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis have recently been published. Manglik and colleagues [1] looked into secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in patients who present with severe sepsis. Measuring maximal cortisol secretion after stimulation with adrenocorticotrophic hormone, those investigators found that 9% of their population failed an adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test. Four per cent had previously undiagnosed pituitary disease and 5% were suffering from sepsis-related adrenal dysfunction. They used absolute cortisol levels and not delta cortisol to define adrenocortical insufficiency, but until we have an established definition for adrenocortical insufficiency in sepsis the studies will continue to yield disparate results."
Use of Unamplified RNA/cDNA-Hybrid Nanopore Sequencing for Rapid Detection and Characterization of RNA Viruses Technical Appendix Viral Growth and RNA Isolation,"To determine the ability of nanopore sequencing to provide rapid genomic data on RNA virus pathogens, a workflow was adopted and developed from cDNA sequencing protocols created by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford, UK) (MAP SEQ-002) (Figure 1, panel A). In brief, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) vaccine strain TC-83 and Ebola virus (EBOV) variant Makona isolate C05 stock IRF0137 (EBOV/Mak-C05) were grown and RNA isolated from clarified cell-culture supernatants. VEEV TC-83 was prepared from stocks derived from United States Army Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC-83 stocks. One MOI of VEEV TC-83 was adsorbed on Vero E6 monolayers for 2 hours. After 48 h of incubation in Minimum Essential Medium-α + 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD;","SAMN04490241, internal reference IRF0137.

One-year molecular survey of astrovirus infection in turkeys in Poland,"The presence of turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was monitored in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland in 2008. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) from 77 flocks aged 1-19 weeks were collected from different regions of the country. RT-PCR experiments were performed for detection and molecular characterization of TAstV using four sets of primers within the RdRp gene (ORF1b). The prevalence of astrovirus was 34/77 (44.15%) in the flocks tested. TAstV type 2 was associated with 30 of 77 infections (38.9%), either alone or in mixed infections; TAstV type 1 was detected in 9 of 77 flocks (11.6%), either alone or in mixed infections; ANV was detected only in one flock (1.29%) by sequence analysis during this study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic variability in the TAstV strains that were isolated. Some of Polish TAstV-2 strains were genetically related to the North American isolates; however, most of them formed a distinct subgroup of ''European'' isolates, suggesting their separate origin or evolution. Additionally, due to the high variability of the TAstV sequences, the most suitable method for TAstV typing seems to be sequencing.","The history of studies on astroviruses (AstV) is rather short, as they were first described by Appleton and Higgins in 1975 in the context of gastrointestinal problems in children [1] . Subsequently identified astroviruses were also associated with enteritis and affected a wide range of host species, such as lambs, calves, piglets, dogs, turkey poults, chickens, guinea fowl, red and roe deer, cats, mice, and mink [2, 4, 14, 16, 26] . Additionally, some astroviruses have also been associated with non-intestinal illness. In ducklings, the virus known as duck virus hepatitis type 2 (DVH2) causes fatal hepatitis, and in chickens, avian nephritis virus (ANV) results in mild growth depression, kidney lesions and mortality [8, 10] ."
BMC Infectious Diseases A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation,"Background: An epidemic of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior.","Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of a very contagious atypical pneumonia (now named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) initiated in the Guangdong Province of China. This outbreak started a world-wide epidemic after a medical doctor from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kow-loon around February 21 st , 2003 (SAR Hong Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pattern of the outbreak became puzzling after an estate in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected by the virus apparently causing the disease. In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak there remained a more or less constant background infection level, that remained present in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local outbreaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic pattern for reasons that have to be analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics that affected pigs in the 1983 -1985 [1] we chose to explore here the consequences of a situation where two overlapping epidemics interfere with each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation and recombination rate of coronaviruses [2] , and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by simple mutations [3] . There are two epidemics, one epidemic is SARS caused by a coronavirus virus, call it virus A. Another epidemic, which may have appeared before SARS, is assumed to be extremely contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innocuousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastroenteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had diarrhoea for about one day, during this winter in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recombination event from virus B [4] [5] [6] . We also explore the possible situation where viruses A and B would be of totally different origin, but would cause an overlapping immune response of the host. Both epidemics would spread in parallel, and it can be expected that the epidemic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, protects against SARS (so that naïve regions, not protected by the epidemic B can get SARS large outbreaks). Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epidemic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puzzling distribution of the disease in Mainland China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight and frequent contacts with Guangdong and Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer conclusions on the accuracy of available epidemiological data."
Is respiratory viral infection really an important trigger of asthma exacerbations in children? Respiratory syncytial virus PCR Polymerase chain reaction SARS Severe acute respiratory syndrome,"to delineate attributing the effect of different respiratory viral infections including newly discovered ones to asthma exacerbations in children in Hong Kong. One hundred and fourteen children aged 6-14 years with chronic stable asthma and on regular inhaled steroid were monitored for respiratory symptoms over a full calendar year from recruitment. They would attend the study clinic if peak expiratory flow rate decreased to below 80% of their baselines, if they met a predefined symptom score, or if parents subjectively felt them developing a cold. Virological diagnosis using virus culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction methods on nasal swab specimens would be attempted for all these visits irrespective of triggers. Physician diagnosed outcome of each episode was documented. Three hundred and five episodes of respiratory illnesses were captured in the cohort. Nasal specimens were available in 166 episodes, 92 of which were diagnosed as asthma exacerbations, and 74 nonasthma related episodes. Respiratory viruses were detected in 61 of 166 episodes (36.7%). There was no significant difference in virus detection rate between asthma exacerbations (32 out of 97 episodes, 34.8%) and non-asthma respiratory illnesses (29 out of 79 episodes, 39.2%). Although newly discovered respiratory viruses were identified in these episodes, rhinovirus was the commonest organism associated with both asthma exacerbations and non-asthma related episodes. Plausible explanations for much lower virus detection rate than previously reported include improved personal hygiene and precautionary measures taken during respiratory tract infections in the immediate post-severe acute respiratory syndrome period together with a significant contribution of other adverse factors like environmental air pollution. We conclude that not all viral infections in children with asthma lead to an asthma exacerbation and the attributing effect of different triggers of asthma exacerbations in children vary across different time periods and across different localities.","episode was documented.

Genomic and proteomic approaches for studying human cancer: Prospects for true patient-tailored therapy,"Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper will review the studies that best demonstrate how genomics and proteomics technologies can be used to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment it will specifically highlight the important work being incorporated into clinical trials.","Cancer researchers have made significant progress in identifying a new 'molecular taxonomy' of cancer through the use of genomics technologies. Specifically, the use of DNA microarrays has created robust molecular phenotypes for many tumours, including brain, 1,2 breast, 3 -10 colon, 11, 12 gastric, 13 kidney, 14 leukaemia, 15 -17 lymphoma, 18 -20 lung, 21 -23 melanoma, 24 ovary, 25 -28 prostate 29 -32 and small, round blue-cell tumours of childhood. 33 In a subset of these studies, the gene expression profiles strongly suggest that this information would improve diagnosis and predict clinical outcome when compared with the standardised prognostic criteria, such as tumour grade, tumour size, patient age and patient performance status. 6, 7, 19, 20 These recent breakthroughs in the laboratory have been qualified successes. The lack of a standardised method for data collection, data analysis and validation, however, has made it difficult to rigorously compare studies from different laboratories, and has thus hampered the introduction of this type of data into clinical medicine. Fortunately, the microarray field has proposed universal standardisation guidelines to help scientists and clinicians accurately compare the results from different laboratories, and thereby has potentially paved the way for the use of gene expression analysis in clinical medicine. 34, 35 Based on the published work of van't Veer et al. 6 and van de Vijver et al. 7 the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam announced in January 2003 that it would become the first institution in the world to use DNA microarray analysis to make treatment decisions regarding women with breast cancer. 36 As of today, four additional institutions are incorporating gene expression patterns into clinical trials of breast cancer (Table 1) , 37 and the field awaits the results with great interest."
The Application of Clinical Genetics Dovepress Novel compounds for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: emerging therapeutic agents,"The identification of dystrophin and the causative role of mutations in this gene in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (D/BMD) was expected to lead to timely development of effective therapies. Despite over 20 years of research, corticosteroids remain the only available pharmacological treatment for DMD, although significant benefits and extended life have resulted from advances in the clinical care and management of DMD individuals. Effective treatment of DMD will require dystrophin restitution in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and nonmuscle tissues; however, modulation of muscle loss and regeneration has the potential to play an important role in altering the natural history of DMD, particularly in combination with other treatments. Emerging biological, molecular, and small molecule therapeutics are showing promise in ameliorating this devastating disease, and it is anticipated that regulatory environments will need to display some flexibility in order to accommodate the new treatment paradigms.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive condition caused by mutations in the huge dystrophin gene, is the most common and serious form of childhood muscle wasting, with an incidence of 1 in 3500 live male births (for review see Emery 1 ). Under tissue-specific control of at least seven promoters, the full-length 427 kDa dystrophin isoforms, encoded by 79 exons spanning ∼2. 4 Mbp, are expressed primarily in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and brain (for review see Love et al 2 ) . The prevalence of DMD may be attributed to the high frequency of de novo mutations, which in turn is influenced by the size, nature, and organization of the dystrophin gene. Many dystrophin introns are fivefold to eightfold larger than the average human gene of 30 kb pairs. One in three cases of DMD present with no prior family history, 3 and this fact, coupled with the size and complexity of the gene pose great challenges to prevention and genetic counseling programs."
"Respiratory Pathogens in Qu ebec Dairy Calves and Their Relationship with Clinical Status, Lung Consolidation, and Average Daily Gain","Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is 1 of the 2 most important causes of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves. Surprisingly, field data are scant concerning the prevalence of respiratory pathogens involved in BRD in preweaned dairy calves, especially in small herds.","B ovine respiratory disease (BRD) is 1 of the 2 most important causes of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves and affects both preweaned and weaned calves. 1 BRD is a syndrome of diverse etiology that is caused by 1 or more of a wide range of organisms, including bacteria and viruses. Among bacteria, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, and Trueperella pyogenes are more commonly reported. 2 Viruses involved in the development of BRD are mainly bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine coronavirus (BCV). 2 Most of these pathogens are considered omnipresent in cattle populations and the exact role of some of them, such as Mycoplasma spp. or BCV, in the development of BRD is still unclear. [2] [3] [4] The relative importance of these organisms in BRD pathogenesis also may be different among farms, depending on which pathogens are most prevalent and how they interact together. Over the past 10-15 years, there has been emergence or re-emergence of respiratory pathogens such as BCV 5 and Mycoplasma bovis, 6 which were shown to be involved in the development of BRD in dairy calves. Currently, data on the prevalence and relative importance of these different BRD pathogens in preweaned dairy calves are scant, and available data are usually from large dairy farms. Therefore, it is unclear if the prevalence of BRD pathogens is the same in large herds as in small herds such as those located in Eastern Canada."
"P1 Comparison of carbamylated versus recombinant erythropoietin during spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury P2 Sodium 4-phenylbutylate protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing unfolded protein response-mediated apoptosis in mice P3 Time-dependent eff ects of intravenous H 2 S during long-term, resuscitated porcine hemorrhagic shock","We previously showed that erythropoietin (EPO) attenuates the morphological signs of spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in swine [1] without, however, improving neurological function. The clinical use of EPO has been cautioned most recently due to serious safety concerns arising from an increased mortality in acute stroke patients treated with EPO and simultaneously receiving systemic thrombolysis [2]. Carbamylated EPO (cEPO) is an EPO derivative without erythropoietic activity and devoid of the EPO side eff ects, but with apparently well maintained cytoprotective qualities [3]. We therefore tested the hypothesis whether cEPO may be equally effi cient as EPO in reducing morphological as well as functional aortic occlusion-induced spinal cord I/R injury. Methods In a randomized and blinded trial pigs received either vehicle (control, n = 9), EPO or cEPO, respectively (n = 9 each; 5,000 IU/kg over 30 minutes before and during the fi rst 4 hours of reperfusion). Animals underwent 30 minutes of thoracic aortic balloon occlusion with catheters placed immediately downstream of the A. subclavia and upstream of the aortic trifurcation. Spinal cord function was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEP as percentage of the amplitude before aortic occlusion) and lower limb refl exes (assessed as the subjective strength of response) for a period of 10 hours after reperfusion. Tissue damage was evaluated using Nissl staining. Results Both EPO-treated and cEPO-treated animals presented with attenuated spinal cord injury in the Nissl staining (median (quartile) percentage of damaged neurons in the thoracic segments: control 27 (25,44), cEPO 8 (4,10), and EPO 5 (5,7), P <0.001 vs control group; in the lumbar segments: control 26 (19,32), cEPO 7 (5,13), EPO 8 (5,10), P <0.001 vs control group). However, while only cEPO treatment was associated with recovery of the MEP amplitude to pre-occlusion values when compared with the control group (P <0.05), lower limb refl ex response was comparably restored stronger in both treatment groups (P <0.05 vs control). Conclusions In a clinically relevant porcine model mimicking aortic crossclamping during vascular surgery repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm, cEPO protected spinal cord function and integrity as eff ective as EPO when applied at equipotent doses.

Phenylbutyrate reduced the unfolded protein response.","Introduction Unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated apoptosis plays a pivotal role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) has been reported to act as a chemical chaperone inhibiting UPR-mediated apoptosis triggered by ischemia in various organs other than the heart. Therefore we investigated whether PBA reduces UPR-mediated apoptosis and protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Methods C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 30 minutes LAD ischemia followed by reperfusion. PBA (100 mg/kg) or PBS (control) was administrated intraperitoneally just before ischemia. Apoptosis, infarct size and tissue protein levels of Grp78 and caspase-12 (UPR-mediated apoptosisassociated protein) were evaluated by TUNEL, TTC stain and western blot analyses, respectively, at 48 hours after ischemia (n = 5 for each group). Echocardiography was performed at 3 weeks after ischemia and the survival ratio was observed (n = 9 for each group). Results Compared with PBS, PBA reduced apoptotic cells (30.8 ± 0.2% vs 20.5 ± 0.5%, P <0.05) and infarct size (32.0 ± 3.8% vs 13.0 ± 2.1%, P <0.01) after ischemia-reperfusion. Grp78 and caspase-12 were increased in mice with PBS, but PBA attenuated the increase in Grp78 (P <0.05) and caspase-12 (P <0.05). PBA inhibited the deterioration of cardiac parameters including LVEDD (3.35 ± 0.08 mm vs 2.74 ± 0.11 mm, P <0.01), LVESD (2.30 ± 0.08 mm vs 1.54 ± 0.12 mm, P <0.01), and %FS (31.3 ± 2.2% vs 39.4 ± 2.2%, P <0.05). All mice with PBA survived, but 33% animals with PBS died. Conclusions PBA maintained cardiac function and improved survival ratio after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion by reducing UPR-mediated apoptosis in mice. References Introduction In awake, spontaneously breathing mice, inhaling hydrogen sulfi de (H 2 S) induced a hibernation-like metabolic state characterised by reduced energy expenditure and hypothermia [1] , which protected against otherwise lethal hypoxia [2] and hemorrhage [3] . In contrast, other authors reported that inhibition of endogenous H 2 S synthesis attenuated posthemorrhage organ dysfunction [4, 5] . All these data originate, however, from unresuscitated models using a pre-treatment design. Therefore we investigated the time-dependent eff ect of intravenous H 2 S in a clinically relevant, long-term model of porcine hemorrhage and resuscitation. Methods After surgical instrumentation, pigs were subjected to 4 hours of hemorrhagic shock induced by removal of 40% of the calculated blood volume and thereafter by additional removal or retransfusion of blood boli as needed to maintain MAP = 30 mmHg. Animals randomly received vehicle (control, n = 14) or the intravenous H 2 S donor Na 2 S started 2 hours before hemorrhage (pre-treatment, n = 11), at the beginning of blood removal (early post-treatment, n = 10) or at the beginning of resuscitation (late post-treatment, n = 10). In all groups the Na 2 S infusion was continued over the fi rst 10 hours of reperfusion. Resuscitation comprised retransfusion of shed blood, colloid volume expansion, and noradrenaline titrated to keep MAP at pre-shock levels. Systemic, renal and liver perfusion, O 2 exchange, and organ function were assessed before and at the end of hemorrhage as well as at 10 and 22 hours of resuscitation. Results Survival (71% in the control vs 100, 91, and 90% in the pretreatment, early post-treatment and late post-treatment groups, respectively) was signifi cantly improved in all treatment groups. The noradrenaline infusion rate required to maintain hemodynamic targets was signifi cantly reduced in the early post-treatment group only, which coincided with a progressive drop in core temperature and attenuated kidney dysfunction (blood creatinine levels, creatinine clearance) in these animals. Conclusions Na 2 S application improved survival regardless of the drug timing. The less benefi cial eff ect of pre-treatment on organ function may be due to the higher total amount of drug infused, possibly suggesting some toxicity at these doses."
Pathogenicity and antigenicity of a new variant of Korean nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus,"Despite the existence of an active vaccination program, recently emerged strains of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Korea have caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In this study, we assessed the pathogenic and antigenic characteristics of a K-IIb type field strain of IBV that emerged in Korea since 2003, such as Kr/Q43/06. Specific pathogen free 1-weekold chickens exhibited severe respiratory symptoms (dyspnea) and nephropathogenic lesions (swollen kidneys with nephritis and urate deposits) following challenge with the recent IBV field strain. The antigenic relatedness (R value), based on a calculated virus neutralization index, of the K-IIb type field strain and K-IIa type strain KM91 (isolated in 1991) was 30%, which indicated that the recent strain, Kr/Q43/06, is a new variant that is antigenically distinct from strain KM91. This report is the first to document the emergence of a new antigenic variant of nephropathogenic IBV in chicken from Korea.","Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is a highly contagious viral disease of chickens with a worldwide distribution [4] .

IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGIC ACTIVITY OF INTERFERON BETA FORMULATIONS USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF RELAPSING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,"A new formulation (NF) of subcutaneous (sc) interferon (IFN) β-1a was developed in an attempt to improve injection tolerability and immunogenicity. We compared antiviral and IFNβ-stimulated gene (ISG) activities of IFNβ-1a sc NF with IFNβ-1a sc original formulation and IFNβ-1b sc. When equivalent unit amounts were compared, the IFNβ formulations demonstrated similar antiviral activity and induced similar levels of ISG mRNA. However, on a weight basis (ng/mL), significantly more IFNβ-1b sc was needed to equal the antiviral activity of either IFNβ-1a sc formulation, and both IFNβ-1a sc formulations induced significantly higher levels of ISG mRNA than IFNβ-1b sc.","Interferon beta (IFNβ) is an antiviral and immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). [1−5] In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, IFNβ therapy has been shown to reduce relapse rate and brain lesion development in patients with relapsing forms of MS. [2, 4] Indeed, a subcutaneous (sc) formulation of IFNβ-1a (Rebif ® ; Merck Serono S.A., Geneva, Switzerland) administered three times weekly (tiw) and an intramuscular (im) formulation of IFNβ-1a (Avonex ® ; Biogen Idec/Elan, Cambridge, MA, USA) administered once weekly have also been shown to delay the progression of physical disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. [6−8] Three formulations of IFNβ are currently approved in the USA for treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS: IFNβ-1a 22 μg or 44 μg sc tiw (Rebif; original formulation, which is referred to in this article as IFNβ-1a sc), IFNβ-1a 30 μg administered im once weekly (Avonex), and IFNβ-1b 250 μg sc administered every other day (Betaseron ® /Betaferon ® ; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ, USA; Extavia ® , Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA). The response to IFNβ therapy can vary with the type of preparation, and may be impacted by drug formulation, dosing regimen, and route of administration. [1, 9, 10] For example, head-to-head comparisons of different IFNβ formulations demonstrated that higher and more frequent doses of IFNβ had greater efficacy compared with lower, less frequent dosing regimens (of a different IFNβ formulation) for the treatment of relapsing MS. [2,11−13] Treatment with IFNβ in patients with relapsing MS has been associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). [14−17] Although the full clinical impact of these anti-IFN antibodies is not completely known, the presence of high titers of NAbs to IFNβ can reduce the therapeutic effects of treatment. [18] [19] [20] A new sc formulation of IFNβ-1a (Rebif New Formulation [NF]; Merck, Bari, Italy) that is produced without fetal bovine serum and without human serum albumin as an excipient, with the goals of improving injection tolerability and reducing immunogenicity, was developed. [21, 22] In vivo administration of IFNβ-1a sc NF in a mouse model has suggested a slower and weaker development of NAbs compared with IFNβ-1a sc. [23] Biologic activity assessed from in vitro assays can supplement in vivo data, thereby helping to fully characterize a particular therapeutic agent. Evidence from previous studies indicates that the antiviral and biologic activity of IFNβ may vary among different formulations. [1, 10] Specific measures of IFNβ biologic activity include the inhibition of viral replication and the enhanced expression of mRNAs that are induced by IFNβ. The objective of the current in vitro study was to compare the antiviral and IFNβ-stimulated gene (ISG) expression activity of IFNβ-1a sc NF with that of the original IFNβ-1a sc formulation; IFNβ-1b sc was used as an additional comparator."
"Follow-up of Contacts of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus- Infected Returning Travelers, the Netherlands, 2014 Technical Appendix Part 1: Laboratory methods for PCR detection of MERS-CoV and antibody detection","Total RNA was extracted from 200 μL Universal Transport medium (COPAN) by using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and tested for MERS-CoV RNA by internally controlled real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting Orf1A, nucleocapsid, and UpE with the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) as described (1-3). The results were independently confirmed in 2 laboratories (RIVM and Erasmus MC) and samples were considered MERS-CoV positive when at least 2 different MERS-CoV specific targets were reactive (4).","the contacts knew that MERS-CoV could spread by having contact with a camel. Half of the contacts knew MERS-CoV can be transmitted from person to person. Half of the respondents knew that there is no specific treatment for MERS-CoV; one-third (36%) thought a vaccine was available.

Hypothesis Computer aided prediction and identification of potential epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belongs to the coronaviridae family. In spite of several outbreaks in the very recent years, no vaccine against this deadly virus is developed yet. In this study, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV was analyzed through Computational Immunology approach to identify the antigenic determinants (epitopes). In order to do so, the sequences of S glycoprotein that belong to different geographical regions were aligned to observe the conservancy of MERS-CoV RBD. The immune parameters of this region were determined using different in silico tools and Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Molecular docking study was also employed to check the affinity of the potential epitope towards the binding cleft of the specific HLA allele. The N-terminus RBD (S367-S606) of S glycoprotein was found to be conserved among all the available strains of MERS-CoV. Based on the lower IC50 value, a total of eight potential T-cell epitopes and 19 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I alleles were identified for this conserved region. A 9-mer epitope CYSSLILDY displayed interactions with the maximum number of MHC class-I molecules and projected the highest peak in the B-cell antigenicity plot which concludes that it could be a better choice for designing an epitope based peptide vaccine against MERS-CoV considering that it must undergo further in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, in molecular docking study, this epitope was found to have a significant binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol towards the binding cleft of the HLA-C*12:03 molecule.","(WHO), till date a total of 536 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been identified, 145 of which resulted in death (http: //www.who.int /csr/disease /coronavirus infections/archive_updates/en). Though it has not hit the world population in a massive scale yet, its progressive invasiveness with concerning fatality rate raises the demand of therapeutic solutions or vaccination on an urgent basis."
Commensal enteric bacteria lipopolysaccharide impairs host defense against disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection HHS Public Access,"Commensal enteric bacteria maintain systemic immune responsiveness that protects against disseminated or localized infection in extra-intestinal tissues caused by pathogenic microbes. However, since shifts in infection susceptibility after commensal bacteria eradication have primarily been probed using viruses, the broader applicability to other pathogen types remains undefined. In sharp contrast to diminished antiviral immunity, we show commensal bacteria eradication bolsters protection against disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection. Enhanced antifungal immunity reflects more robust systemic expansion of Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophils, and their mobilization into infected tissues among antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice. Reciprocally, depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels or intestinal LPS reconstitution overrides the antifungal protective benefits conferred by commensal bacteria eradication. This discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity highlights intrinsic differences in how commensal bacteria control responsiveness for specific immune cell subsets because pathogen-specific CD8 + T cells that protect against viruses were suppressed similarly after C. albicans and influenza A virus infection. Thus, positive calibration of antiviral immunity by commensal bacteria is counterbalanced by restrained activation of other immune components that confer antifungal immunity.","Commensal microbes are increasingly recognized to control systemic immune homeostasis and responsiveness. Since the greatest density of commensal bacteria reside within the intestinal tract with an estimated 100 trillion organisms comprising over 1000 individual species, 1 the symbiotic relationship between commensal microbes and the mammalian host have appropriately been most extensively characterized in this tissue. Accumulating evidence shows enteric commensal bacteria play important roles in maintaining local immune homeostasis, along with digestion and nutrient absorption. 1 In turn, disrupting the composition of intestinal bacteria represents an important iatrogenic cause of diarrhea from antibiotics used for infection treatment or prevention. 2 Although the microbial culprits in most cases are unidentified, a classic example is toxin-induced intestinal inflammation from Clostridium difficile overgrowth among antibiotic exposed individuals. 2 Disruptions in intestinal microbiota composition similarly occur among individuals with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 3 and the communicability of aberrant intestinal inflammation to genetically non-susceptible hosts reinforces the immune regulatory properties of enteric commensal microbes. 4 Thus among healthy individuals, commensal intestinal microbes and immune cells sustain a delicate crosstalk that silences pathological inflammation while simultaneously preserving host defense against enteric pathogens."

Management of sepsis in neutropenic patients: 2014 updated guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (AGIHO),"Sepsis is a major cause of mortality during the neutropenic phase after intensive cytotoxic therapies for malignancies. Improved management of sepsis during neutropenia may reduce the mortality of cancer therapies. Clinical guidelines on sepsis treatment have been published by others. However, optimal management may differ between neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. Our aim is to give evidencebased recommendations for haematologist, oncologists and intensive care physicians on how to manage adult patients with neutropenia and sepsis.","guidelines on the management of sepsis have been published [15, 41, 43, 60, 96, 106, 132, 137] ; however, none of these guidelines specifically address diagnosis and management of sepsis in neutropenic patients."
"Persistent Human Cosavirus Infection in Lung Transplant Recipient, Italy",Human cosavirus is a novel picornavirus recently identified in feces from children in southern Asia. We report infection with human cosavirus in a patient in the Mediterranean area. The patient was an adult double lung transplant recipient who had chronic diarrhea associated with persistent infection with human cosavirus.,"I n 2008, a new virus was detected in fecal samples from children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (1) . The genome structure of the new virus was closely related to those in the family Picornaviridae, but phylogenetic analysis showed that it diverged from known picornaviruses. Thus, a new genus of picornaviruses was proposed: Human Cosavirus (common stool-associated virus; HCoSV)."
"Trypsin Isoinhibitors with Antiproliferative Activity toward Leukemia Cells from Phaseolus vulgaris cv ""White Cloud Bean""","A purification protocol that comprised ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose, and gel filtration by FPLC on Superdex 75 was complied to isolate two trypsin inhibitors from Phaseolus vulgaris cv ""White Cloud Bean"". Both trypsin inhibitors exhibited a molecular mass of 16 kDa and reduced the activity of trypsin with an IC 50 value of about 0.6 μM. Dithiothreitol attenuated the trypsin inhibitory activity, signifying that an intact disulfide bond is indispensable to the activity. [Methyl-3 H] thymidine incorporation by leukemia L1210 cells was inhibited with an IC 50 value of 28.8 μM and 21.5 μM, respectively.

,"African swine fever virus is transmissible through animal consumption of contaminated feed. To determine virus survival during transoceanic shipping, we calculated the half-life of the virus in 9 feed ingredients exposed to 30-day shipment conditions. Half-lives ranged from 9.6 to 14.2 days, indicating that the feed matrix environment promotes virus stability.","However, half-life calculations were based on the limited data available at the time, including 2 time points representing inoculation dose and titers at the conclusion of the study and insufficient replicates from which to calculate SEs or 95% CIs around the half-life estimates.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with severe ARDS,"Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has evolved as a treatment option for patients having rev ersible severe respiratory failure who are deter iorating on conventional ventilation. 1,2 We describe our experience with a patient who received ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: This is a retrospective case report for which approval for presentation has been obtained from the administration of the department and can be submitted upon request. Our patient was an 18-yearold female with a long history of SLE with nephritis who was recently started on immunosuppression, admitted with azotemia, fluid overload, and respiratory failure, and initially improved with fluid removal. 3 Her respiratory status later worsened with saturations in the low 80s despite 100% FiO 2 and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cm H 2 O. She had a trial of prone positioning together with PEEP optimization, but her condition continued to deteriorate. 4 The patient was evaluated for rescue ECMO therapy as a life-saving measure. 5 Both femoral veins were cannulated, and when ECMO started, there was immediate improvement in oxygenation. The ventilator was soon switched to the pressure control setting (PEEP 10 cm H 2 O/inspiratory pressure 10 cm H 2 O/rate 10 cycles/min) with 40% FiO 2 . The patient's hospital stay was complicated by lupus-induced thrombocytopenia, resulting in our decision to run heparin-free ECMO. She was decannulated after 25 days of ECMO without receiving any systemic anticoagulation. Results: The patient improved and was decannulated, extubated, and discharged from hospital, with no residual lung comorbidity. Conclusions: ECMO without any systemic anticoagulation is an acceptable therapy when there is","profound respiratory failure secondary to infection in an immunosuppressed patient. 5 Most of the literature reviews have already shown the good application of ECMO in SLE-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. 6 Our case report presents a promising application of rescue ECMO therapy in a lupus-induced immunosuppressed patient with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, 7 "
Severe Measles Infection The Spectrum of Disease in 36 Critically Ill Adult Patients,France has recently witnessed a nationwide outbreak of,"M easles virus (MV) is a small spherical, enveloped, singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. 15 Despite the availability of an effective vaccine for more than 30 years, measles still represents a major harbinger of death in low income countries, affecting chiefly malnourished infants and claiming about 150,000 lives per year. 44, 77 Although it was supposedly on the verge of extinction in France, MV has reemerged spectacularly since 2008 with over 20,000 registered cases of measles. 21, 47, 60 In the last 3 years, outbreaks have repeatedly been reported elsewhere in Europe, calling into question the assumption that measles is a disease confined to developing countries. 18, 24, 37, 65 Recent works have pointed to insufficient vaccine coverage as the main reason for the resurgence of measles, strengthening claims that this disease is likely to pose unique challenges over the coming years. 37, 47, 49, 77, 84 Another major source of concern is the growing proportion of young adults affected by the epidemics, an age group more prone to severe complications such as encephalitis and pneumonia. 49, 64 In comparison to the profuse data available on recent measles epidemics, to our knowledge a study addressing the specificities of severe measles affecting an adult population had yet to be conducted. Herein, we report 36 cases of patients with measles requiring ICU admission."
SARS Coronavirus Detection Methods,"Using clinical samples from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, we showed that the sensitivities of a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (80% for fecal samples and 25% for urine samples) were higher than those of the polyclonal (50% and 5%) and monoclonal (35% and 8%) antibody-based nucleocapsid antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.","Fecal specimens (n = 40, from 40 patients 1-27 days after symptom onset) and urine specimens (n = 133, from 101 patients 2-57 days after symptom onset) were collected from SARS patients hospitalized in Hong Kong from March to May 2003. SARS was confirmed by the presence of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G against SARS-CoV by an immunofluorescence assay (4) . Specimens were tested with polyclonal and monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISAs for SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and realtime qRT-PCR. Control urine (n = 100) and fecal (n = 100) specimens were obtained from hospitalized patients without SARS."
Nanoyeast and Other Cell Envelope Compositions for Protein Studies and Biosensor Applications,"Rapid progress in disease biomarker discovery has increased the need for robust detection technologies. In the past several years, the designs of many immunoaffinity reagents have focused on lowering costs and improving specificity while also promoting stability. Antibody fragments (scFvs) have long been displayed on the surface of yeast and phage libraries for selection; however, the stable production of such fragments presents challenges that hamper their widespread use in diagnostics. Membrane and cell wall proteins similarly suffer from stability problems when solubilized from their native environment. Recently, cell envelope compositions that maintain membrane proteins in native or native-like lipid environment to improve their stability have been developed. This cell envelope composition approach has now been adapted toward stabilizing antibody fragments by retaining their native cell wall environment. A new class of immunoaffinity reagents has been developed that maintains antibody fragment attachment to yeast cell wall. Herein, we review recent strategies that incorporate cell wall fragments with functional scFvs, which are designed for easy production while maintaining specificity and stability when in use with simple detection platforms. These cell wall based antibody fragments are globular in structure, and heterogeneous in size, with fragments ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. These fragments appear to retain activity once immobilized onto biosensor surfaces for the specific and sensitive detection of pathogen antigens. They can be quickly and economically generated from a yeast display library and stored lyophilized, at room temperature, for up to a year with little effect on stability. This new format of scFvs provides stability, in a simple and lowcost manner toward the use of scFvs in biosensor applications. The production and ""panning"" of such antibody cell wall composites are also extremely facile, enabling the rapid adoption of stable and inexpensive affinity reagents for emerging infectious threats.","Proteins are widely used as biomarker targets for medicine, 1 as such protein target characterization and affinity binder production for proteomic immunosensors 2−4 are the focus of extensive research and development. Proteins and antibodies are naturally produced within a biological environment; however, many biotechnology applications require these biomolecules to be solubilized for further study and use. This is problematic because many of these biomolecules often lose stability (denatures by losing its quaternary, tertiary, and secondary structure) once introduced into a foreign (non-native) environment. Membrane-bound proteins in particular have been widely exploited as druggable targets 5 but are difficult to study as solubilized targets due to protein conformation changes in the absence of a stabilizing lipid or cell wall environment. Similarly, synthetic recombinant antibodies produced in eukaryotic or prokaryotic production systems commonly lose stability, especially when they originated in a display library. Many strategies have been developed to overcome these stability issues. Particularly promising are cell envelope compositions to stabilize proteins and recombinant antibodies in native or native-like environments."
"Minimising prescribing errors in the ICU DJ Melia, S Saha Queen' s Hospital, Romford, UK Critical Care","We aimed to audit the prescribing practice on a busy 14-bedd general ICU, and develop standardised practices and tools to improve safety. Prescribing errors occur as commonly as in 10% of UK hospital admissions, costing 8.5 extra bed days per admission, and costing the National Health Service an estimated £1 billion per annum [1]. The majority of these mistakes are avoidable [2]. Methods We audited the daily infusion charts of all patients in three separate spot checks, over 1 week. We assessed all aspects of prescriptions that make them legal and valid, in accordance with national guidance [3]. New procedures were introduced, which included a standardised prescription sticker, with common, preprinted, infusion prescriptions on (noradrenaline, propofol, and so forth), and education on using the new prescription stickers. A month later the audit process was repeated.","The theft and tampering of controlled drugs (CDs) remains a prevalent patient safety issue. Sadly there are numerous reports of critical care staff stealing CDs for personal use or fi nancial gain and notably there have been some cases where CDs have been substituted for other medications in order to delay detection of the theft. This creates both the hazard of medication errors and potentially exposes patients to opioid intoxicated healthcare workers. As most critical care staff have access to CDs, when drugs are found to be missing it can be diffi cult to identify the perpetrators. Therefore the implementation of a deterrent which also improves the methods of detection is warranted. Methods The Limpet, a device which incorporates a proximity sensor and a camera unit, was installed within the CD cupboard of the critical care unit. Whenever the cupboard was accessed the date and time were recorded and a photograph was taken to identify the staff member. Mock thefts were subsequently undertaken by a designated staff member at random times. This allowed testing of the product to determine the number of times the 'thief' was correctly identifi ed."
Delivery System of CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides through Eliciting an Effective T cell Immune Response against Melanoma in Mice,"Purpose: In order to improve the immunogenicity of whole tumor cell lysate for tumor vaccine, we have designed a series of CpG ODNs to study their transport and to evaluate their anti-tumor activity in B16 melanoma mouse models. Methods: In this study, we investigated whether C-class CpG ODN (CpG ODN-685) could facilitate tumor cell lysate to induce vigorous anti-tumor activity against tumors in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Results: It was found that the combination of tumor cell lysate and CpG ODN-685 could inhibit the growth of B16 melanoma and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover CpG ODN-685 with the addition of tumor cell lysate can also cause the generation of tumor specific immune memory by inducing specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes in mice.","Effective initiation of specific anti-tumor immunity in vivo or in vitro has been investigated by many scientists [1] [2] [3] . Most of their research has focused on the induction of adequate tumor antigen-specific effector cells. For this purpose, tumor antigens or tumor-associated antigens were prepared in vitro by expressing them to produce recombinant peptides, cloning them to construct recombinant DNA vaccines, or loading them to dendritic cells (DCs) to making DC vaccines [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . All efforts were devoted to efficiently conjugate tumor antigens to T cells so that immune tolerance could be broken. Many studies revealed promising results for inhibiting tumor growth inhibition and elongation of animal survival in animal tu-mor models. However, tumor is a multiple genetic disease and targeting one or two signaling molecules in tumor cells may be not enough to inhibit growth 12, 13 . The use of tumor lysate as tumor antigens was developed and utilized for many tumor cell lines in modified ways and proved to be an effective strategy to inhibit growth [14] [15] [16] . Most studies showed undesired results in inducing specific anti-tumor immunity, while others manifested potential anti-tumor effects [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The advantage of using tumor lysate as antigens is that it provides a feasible avenue to target multiple sites on tumor cells. Various attempts had been made to enhance the antigenicity of tumor lysate, such as plusing DC to tumor lysate or combining Ivyspring International Publisher cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF) with tumor lysate. These methods have demonstrated efficacy in some tumor types but not for all. Despite this, the use of tumor lysates as a potential anti-tumor vaccine has proved to be a valuable tool."
Usefulness of Published PCR Primers in Detecting Human Rhinovirus Infection,"We conducted a preliminary comparison of the relative sensitivity of a cross-section of published human rhinovirus (HRV)-specifi c PCR primer pairs, varying the oligonucleotides and annealing temperature. None of the pairs could detect all HRVs in 2 panels of genotyped clinical specimens; >1 PCR is required for accurate description of HRV epidemiology.","H uman rhinoviruses (HRVs) cause more asthma exacerbations than any other known factor, in addition to causing most colds and infl uenza-like illnesses. The prevalence of HRV in published reports varies considerably. A novel HRV clade identifi ed in 2006, now known as HRV species C (HRV-C) (1), can be identifi ed only by PCR. Since 1988, seasonality and clinical outcomes and numerous different primer pairs have been used to identify HRV; how well these methods perform on new HRV types is uncertain. Given the likely variation in the preparation of RNA, the quality and formulations of commercial reverse transcription (RT)-PCR enzymes and reaction mix components and changes in thermal cyclers since 1988, not surprisingly many, perhaps most, of these assays are not being used in the manner they were originally described. For example, the fi rst HRV-specifi c primers reported (2) have subsequently been used with different RNA preparation methods, amounts of reverse transcriptase, cDNA priming strategies, dNTP concentrations, annealing temperatures (T M s), and cycling conditions (3, 4) ."

"Meaningful Use (MU), Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)","Public Health immunization registries and the immunization ecosystem have evolved over the past two decades to become significant population health data assets. Clinical providers and pharmacists are reporting the immunizations given to their patients to public health registries in 49 states and all territories, creating consolidated immunization event patient records.","Most of these immunization events are reported through the provider's Electronic Health Record system (EHR), Pharmacy Management System (PMS), online, or through data uploads. Meaningful Use and health data standards (HL7) became the drivers that accelerated reporting to immunization registries and significantly improved the quantity and quality of the data. The infrastructure supporting the Immunization Ecosystem (IE) has enabled real-time compliance reporting and, more importantly, realtime patient queries. The provider community now has online access to a patient's immunization history in over three quarters of the states, and growing. This access includes a forecast of the patient's immunization gaps provided by public health decision support tools based upon the most recent ACIP recommendations. This is creating an opportunity for the provider and the patient to work together to reduce their risk of suffering a vaccine-preventable disease. This IE and the data in an Immunization Information System (IIS) are especially useful as pharmacies expand their immunization practices and create opportunities to reduce the adolescent and adult immunization gaps."
Challenge models to assess new therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Current therapies confer partial benefits either by incompletely improving airflow limitation or by reducing acute exacerbations, hence new therapies are desirable. In the absence of robust early predictors of clinical efficacy, the potential success of novel therapeutic agents in COPD will not entirely be known until the drugs enter relatively large and costly clinical trials. New predictive models in humans, and new study designs are being sought to allow for confirmation of pharmacodynamic and potentially clinically meaningful effects in early development. This review focuses on human challenge models with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, ozone, and rhinovirus, in the early clinical development phases of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment and reduction of exacerbations in COPD.","The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease defines chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a … common preventable and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients. 1 Exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation, which lead to airway wall edema, sputum plugging, and bronchoconstriction."

Entry Screening for Infectious Diseases in Humans PERSPECTIVE Find emerging infectious disease information on,"In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003 and the influenza pandemic of 2009, many countries instituted border measures as a means of stopping or slowing the spread of disease. The measures, usually consisting of a combination of border entry/exit screening, quarantine, isolation, and communications, were resource intensive, and modeling and observational studies indicate that border screening is not effective at detecting infectious persons. Moreover, border screening has high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need. We discuss the border-screening experiences with SARS and influenza and propose an approach to decision-making for future pandemics. We conclude that outbreak-associated communications for travelers at border entry points, together with effective communication with clinicians and more effective disease control measures in the community, may be a more effective approach to the international control of communicable diseases.","M any countries instituted border screening in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003 and the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic of 2009, and although not formally evaluated, the experiences of several countries have been documented (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Given the recent emergence of the influenza A(H7N9) virus in many parts of China (12) , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia (13) , and the current, most widespread Ebola outbreak in Africa (14) , it seems timely to consider the costs and the effectiveness of border screening, as shown by recent experiences. Herein, we discuss the use of border-screening measures instituted during the 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2009 influenza pandemic."

Despite the relatively large number of cases, little is known about the disease pathology of MERS in humans (2) . Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is therefore mostly based on data derived from studies in animal models. Although the first animal model used to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis and test potential countermeasures became available shortly after the discovery of MERS-CoV (3) , all the animal models that have been developed so far have drawbacks (4) . Because of the host restriction conferred by the binding of the MERS-CoV spike protein to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), small animal models that are routinely used to conduct infectious disease research are not naturally susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Although human DPP4-transgenic mouse models have been developed, these do not completely recapitulate the disease pathology observed in humans. Nonhuman primate models recapitulate mild and moderate human disease pathology; however, practical and ethical constraints limit work with these models."
Exposure of cats to low doses of FeLV: seroconversion as the sole parameter of infection,"In felids, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive (virus readily eliminated and never detectable) to progressive infection (persistent viremia and viral shedding). Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.","Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus of great veterinary importance that was discovered more than 40 years ago [20] and infects domestic cats and some related small felids worldwide [18, 22, 32] . An infection with FeLV may cause disorders of hematopoietic cells, a state of immunodeficiency and fatal neoplasia. Common symptoms are fever, anaemia, anorexia and weight loss. The prevalence of FeLV infection has been decreasing in the past few years. In Switzerland, FeLV prevalence was found to be 3% in healthy and of up to 13% in ill cats [29] . Decreasing prevalence is the consequence of identification and segregation of infected cats, and of extensive vaccination programs. However, cases of recurrence keep occurring and emphasise the importance of an accurate diagnosis [24] . FeLV is mainly transmitted directly from cat to cat. Transmission occurs through contact with saliva via licking, mutual grooming and sharing of food or water dishes or trough bites [5, 6] . Infectious FeLV can also be transmitted via faeces and milk [8, 34] . FeLV RNA was also detected in urine, but, its infection potential has not been demonstrated so far [1] . Pathogenesis is well understood if infectious pressure is high. Infection starts in the oropharynx where the virus first replicates in tonsils and local lymph nodes [37] , from which the virus spreads to the bone marrow, thymus, spleen and intestine through infected lymphocytes. Bone marrow infection is an important hallmark of FeLV pathogenesis as the virus replicates extensively in bone marrow and infects blood precursor cells first, and many organs and tissues thereafter, including salivary gland, tonsils, pharyngeal, urinary bladder, gastric, intestinal, colonic, pancreatic and endometrial epithelia, lymph nodes throughout the body, bone marrow, and spleen [36, 37] . FeLV infection presents a variety of outcomes [11, 16-18, 25, 27, 35, 37, 38] , which are influenced by both host and virus factors. Known host resistance factors include age and immune system status. Known virologic factors are virus strain, subtype and viral infection dose [18] . The outcome of infection is still a rather controversial issue. In the past, infection outcome was classified as viremic, non-viremic, and transiently viremic based on results of virus isolation, immunofluorescence assays and/or antigen detection [27] . Viremic cats are characterized by continuous expression of p27 viral antigen. FeLV infection is not contained due to a lack of FeLV specific immunity [3, 4, 18] . Viremic cats continuously shed virus, thereby posing a risk of infection to susceptible cats, and usually succumb to FeLV-associated diseases (anaemia, immunosuppression, and neoplasia). In transiently viremic cats, viremia is overcome after a few weeks post-infection (p.i.). However, transiently viremic cats remain provirus positive [15] . In addition, some nonviremic cats were shown to have localized infection characterized by virus replication in certain tissues, such as mammary, salivary and urinary epithelium [8, 12, 34] . This additional form of FeLV infection was termed atypical or sequestered infection. New sensitive molecular assays have been described recently for the use in detection and quantification of FeLV provirus DNA and viral RNA [14, 39, 42] , resulting in a more sensitive measure for FeLV exposure. The spectrum of host response categories was refined accordingly. Especially in p27 negative cats, the outcome should be reevaluated based on the presence or absence of FeLV proviral DNA in blood or bone marrow. The spectrum of host response categories was thus reclassified into: abortive (no virus detected after exposure), regressive (p27-negative, provirus positive after or without transient antigenemia) and progressive (persistently p27 positive, virus isolation, provirus positive, FeLV RNA positive) [16] . Whether cats that show no signs of infection (abortive) are truly immune or just resistant, is still open to debate. In this context, a very interesting finding was that FeLV infection can be transmitted by contact with faeces [8] with no apparent viremia and infection involving the bone marrow, and constant negativity for proviral DNA in blood -which would be classified as abortive infection. However, in the study of Gomes-Keller et al. [8] FeLV provirus could be detected in several organs and the cats showed seroconversion, indicating that infection indeed had occurred. It was concluded that under low infectious pressure a different pathogenesis may take place in which bone marrow is not involved. Since FeLV transmission at very low infection levels appears to be the most natural way of infection, many cats may show this yet uncharacterized outcome. Cats that test negative for FeLV by conventional diagnostic methods could still have been infected and constitute a relevant portion of the cat population affected by the virus. The prevalence of FeLV infection may therefore have been underestimated, a factor that can have important consequences for FeLV control management, e.g. in Iberian lynxes, which seem to be particularly susceptible for FeLV infection and for which a correct estimation of FeLV spreading potential is of great importance [32] . It was thus the aim of this study to further characterize the course of infection after exposure to low infectious pressure and to test the hypothesis that low FeLV doses applied to young cats may lead to seroconversion even when the infection does not progress through bone marrow. The virus may not be completely eliminated and a limited viral replication in tissues may lead to a development of a weak immune response. Three groups of 7 cats were exposed to different, low doses of FeLV. Blood p27 antigen, proviral DNA and viral RNA were measured in blood at regular intervals until week 20 p.i. and in popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder, lungs, thymus, myocardium, parotid gland, and pancreas after euthanasia. Immune response against FeLV was assessed by the detection of antibodies by ELISA to FeLV whole virus and to FeLV p45 (the recombinant env-gene product), by immunofluorescence assay to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA), and by Western blot analysis to the separated FeLV components."
WU and KI Polyomaviruses in Respiratory Samples from Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients,"Data are limited regarding 2 new human polyomaviruses, KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV), in immunocompromised patients. We used realtime PCR to test for these and 12 respiratory viruses in 2,732 nasal wash samples collected during the fi rst year after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from 222 patients. Specimens were collected weekly until day 100; then at least every 3 months. One year after hematopoietic cell transplantation, the cumulative incidence estimate was 26% for KIPyV and 8% for WUPyV. Age <20 years predicted detection of KIPyV (hazard ratio [HR] 4.6) and WUPyV (HR 4.4), and detection of a respiratory virus in the previous 2 weeks predicted KIPyV detection (HR 3.4). Sputum production and wheezing were associated with detection of KIPyV in the past week and WUPyV in the past month. There were no associations with polyomavirus detection and acute graft versus host disease, cytomegalovirus reactivation, neutropenia, lymphopenia, hospitalization, or death.","I n 2007, two new human polyomaviruses, KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV), were identifi ed in respiratory specimens from patients with respiratory illness (1, 2) . Since then, KIPyV and WUPyV have been frequently detected in respiratory specimens, especially those from children with respiratory symptoms and from patients co-infected with a respiratory virus (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, KIPyV and WUPyV were detected at similar rates in specimens from symptomatic patients and in persons without respiratory symptoms (6, 8, 12, 13) , suggesting that these viruses might not cause respiratory illness in immunocompetent children."
Plant polyphenols as dietary antioxidants in human health and disease,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants and are generally involved in defense against ultraviolet radiation or aggression by pathogens. in the last decade, there has been much interest in the potential health benefits of dietary plant polyphenols as antioxidant. epidemiological studies and associated meta-analyses strongly suggest that long term consumption of diets rich in plant polyphenols offer protection against development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present knowledge about the biological effects of plant polyphenols in the context of relevance to human health.","Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds found largely in the fruits, vegetables, cereals and beverages. Fruits like grapes, apple, pear, cherries and berries contains up to 200-300 mg polyphenols per 100 grams fresh weight. The products manufactured from these fruits, also contain polyphenols in significant amounts. Typically a glass of red wine or a cup of tea or coffee contains about 100 mg polyphenols. Cereals, dry legumes and chocolate also contribute to the polyphenolic intake. 1, 2 Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants and are generally involved in defense against ultraviolet radiation or aggression by pathogens. 3 In food, polyphenols may contribute to the bitterness, astringency, color, flavor, odor and oxidative stability. Towards the end of 20 th century, epidemiological studies and associated meta-analyses strongly suggested that long term consumption of diets rich in plant polyphenols offered some protection against development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases 4, 5 (Fig. 1) . Polyphenols and other food phenolics are the subject of increasing scientific interest because of their possible beneficial effects on human health. This review focuses on the present understanding of the biological effects of dietary polyphenols and their importance in human health and disease. Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds found largely in the fruits, vegetables, cereals and beverages. These molecules are secondary metabolites of plants and are generally involved in defense against ultraviolet radiation or aggression by pathogens and may also contribute to the bitterness, astringency of the food. researchers have explored that these molecules are very good antioxidants and may neutralize the destructive reactivity of undesired reactive oxygen/nitrogen species produced as byproduct during metabolic processes in the body. epidemiological studies have revealed that polyphenols provide a significant protection against development of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CvDs), cancer, diabetes, infections, aging, asthma etc."
Virulent Epidemics and Scope of Duty of Care Emerging Infectious Diseases • www,"The phrase ""duty of care"" is, at best, too vague and, at worst, ethically dangerous. The nature and scope of the duty need to be determined, and conflicting duties must be recognized and acknowledged. Duty of care is neither fixed nor absolute but heavily dependent on context. The normal risk level of the working environment, the healthcare worker's specialty, the likely harm and benefits of treatment, and the competing obligations deriving from the worker's multiple roles will all influence the limits of the duty of care. As experts anticipate the arrival of an avian influenza pandemic in humans, discussion of this matter is urgently needed. Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 12, No",E pidemiologists are warning against an impending pandemic of avian influenza that could kill several million people (1) . This possibility raises an urgent and thorny ethical question: Are healthcare professionals obligated to care for patients during virulent epidemics of infectious disease?

Bactericidal and Virucidal Activity of Povidone-Iodine and Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cleansers in an In Vivo Hand Hygiene Clinical Simulation Study,"Introduction: Standard in vitro and in vivo tests help demonstrate efficacy of hand hygiene products; however, there is no standard in vivo test method for viruses. We investigated the bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of povidoneiodine (PVP-I) 7.5% scalp and skin cleanser, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 4% hand cleanser and the reference hand wash (soft soap) in 15 healthy volunteers following European Standard EN1499 (hygienic hand wash test","The importance of hand hygiene in health care and community settings is undoubted, with numerous studies demonstrating the association between proper hand hygiene and reductions in both rates of nosocomial infections [1] [2] [3] and rates of infectious illnesses in communities [4] . Hand hygiene is also an infection control procedure that can be rapidly adopted by the public and healthcare workers in the case of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases to limit the spread of viruses by breaking the transmission [5, 6] ."
Preparation of Aluminum Oxide-Coated Glass Slides for Glycan Microarrays,"In this study, we report the fabrication of aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG) slides for the preparation of glycan microarrays. Pure aluminum (Al, 300 nm) was coated on glass slides via electron-beam vapor deposition polymerization (VDP), followed by anodization to form a thin layer (50−65 nm) of aluminum oxide (Aloxide) on the surface. The ACG slides prepared this way provide a smooth surface for arraying sugars covalently via phosphonate formation with controlled density and spatial distance. To evaluate this array system, a mannose derivative of α-5-pentylphosphonic acid was used as a model for the optimization of covalent arraying based on the fluorescence response of the surface mannose interacting with concanavalin A (ConA) tagged with the fluorescence probe A488. The ACG slide was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ellipsometry, and the sugar loading capacity, uniformity, and structural conformation were also characterized using AFM, a GenePix scanner, and a confocal microscope. This study has demonstrated that the glycan array prepared from the ACG slide is more homogeneous with better spatial control compared with the commonly used glycan array prepared from the N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated glass slide.","Glycan microarrays have been used as an effective tool for the high-throughput analysis of protein−glycan interactions and are thus useful for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and vaccine development. 1−28 Numerous surfaces have been made available for glycan arraying, including (a) noncovalent adsorption of sugar derivatives to the surface of a porous nitrocellulose membrane; [1] [2] [3] [4] 7, 9, 10, 17, 22, 23, 26 metal oxide surface; 5 microtiter plate; fabricated plastics of polystyrene, polypropylene, or polycarbonate; and polyfluorohydrocarbon-linked aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG) slides 21 and (b) covalent attachment to a gold surface or alkenthiol-activated gold surface, 6, [9] [10] [11] 22 epoxy-activated glass slide, 6, 18, 19, 22, 25 N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated glass slide, [8] [9] [10] 14, 20, 22, 24, 25 and ACG slide. 15, 21 The glycan array on ACG slides developed in our laboratory 15, 21 was prepared by spotting glycan−phosphonic acids onto the surface of the ACG slides, 29−31 and the properties of the arrays were characterized using both mass spectrometry and fluorescence scanning microscopy. 15, 21 The fluorescence intensity of sugar−protein interaction on the ACG slide was found to be more sensitive and homogeneous with higher glycan density than that on the NHS-activated glass slides. 14, 15 We have further used the ACG slides to prepare a mixed-glycan array for the study of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated from HIV patients and found that some of the antibodies recognized two different glycans simultaneously; a new observation that was not detected previously by the use of NHS-activated glass slides. 28 In addition, the ACG slide surface can be used for noncovalent hydrophobic adherence of glycans with a fluorohydrocarbon tail for the identification and study of enzyme activity analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry. 16, 21 Despite all of these studies, the fabrication method for the preparation of ACG slides has not been clearly defined. In our previous study, the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) surface had properties and functions similar to those of the native aluminum oxide (NAO) surface. 16 Different vapor deposition polymerization (VDP) techniques have resulted in various degrees of surface roughness. Even the surface morphology of the ACG slides appeared different from that of aluminum objects that have been widely used in industry. 29,32−38 Previous surface treatment of aluminum objects involved mostly indepth anodization for the control of pore sizes but not for the preparation of glycan microarrays. On the basis of our experience, the AAO surface to be used in glycan microarrays should have the following properties: (1) The aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) layer should be smooth enough for the covalent coupling reaction with sugar derivatives of phosphonic acid. 29, 30 (2) The thickness of the Al-oxide layer on the surface should be adjusted to provide optimal fluorescence intensity for the detection of the protein−sugar interaction. In this study, we use the glass slide with electron-beam (E-beam)-coated aluminum to produce ACG slides with various thicknesses under various anodization conditions and then study their effect on the fluorescence intensity in sugar−protein interactions. Mannose with an α-5-pentylphosphonic acid tail was used as a model compound for covalent attachment to the Al-oxide layer, and the fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor-488-tagged ConA (ConA-A488) that interacts with the covalently bound sugar was used to evaluate and optimize the system. Computer software was used to design experiments to fabricate the surface with various thicknesses and roughness of the AAO layer for the study. Data analysis of the result was conducted mathematically and used for the development of optimized conditions for the preparation of ACG slides. "
"A molecular beacon, bead-based assay for the detection of nucleic acids by flow cytometry","Molecular beacons are dual-labelled probes that are typically used in real-time PCR assays, but have also been conjugated with solid matrices for use in microarrays or biosensors. We have developed a fluid array system using microsphere-conjugated molecular beacons and the flow cytometer for the specific, multiplexed detection of unlabelled nucleic acids in solution. For this array system, molecular beacons were conjugated with microspheres using a biotin-streptavidin linkage. A bridged conjugation method using streptavidin increased the signal-tonoise ratio, allowing for further discrimination of target quantitation. Using beads of different sizes and molecular beacons in two fluorophore colours, synthetic nucleic acid control sequences were specifically detected for three respiratory pathogens, including the SARS coronavirus in proof-of-concept experiments. Considering that routine flow cytometers are able to detect up to four fluorescent channels, this novel assay may allow for the specific multiplex detection of a nucleic acid panel in a single tube.","With the continual emergence of new pathogens, the differential diagnosis or identification of etiological agents is the important first step to control the spread of infection. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-hCoV) tested the ability of the scientific community to develop methods to isolate, identify and characterize an emerging virus (1, 2) . The most powerful etiological diagnostic was arguably the use of a microarray 'Viro-chip', which was able to quickly reveal that this pathogen was a coronavirus, even as it also found that this particular coronavirus had never been described previously (3) . It appears that this type of solid-phase array technology will become more routine as the costs decrease, the procedures become streamlined for practical use and the technology becomes better disseminated. Current tests for nucleic acid detection are based upon real-time PCR assays (4) . In these assays, non-specific (SYBR) or probe-specific fluorescence is measured throughout the PCR reaction [reviewed in (5) ]."
New Variants of Porcine Epidemic,"In 2011, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection rates rose substantially in vaccinated swine herds.","F). The disease progressed to death within a few days. Pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited diarrhea and loss of appetite with different degrees of severity, which were determined to be age dependent; 100% of suckling piglets became ill. Pigs >2 weeks of age experienced mild diarrhea and anorexia, which completely resolved within a few days (5) . Morbidity and mortality rates were lower for vaccinated herds than for nonvaccinated herds, which suggests the emergence of a new PEDV fi eld strain(s) for which the current vaccine, based on the CV777 strain, was partially protective. To identify the PEDV strain(s) responsible for the recent outbreak in China, we sequenced the full-length S gene of isolates obtained from diarrhea samples collected from pigs at 9 affected pig farms.

DISPATCHES,We identified influenza C virus (ICV) in samples from US cattle with bovine respiratory disease through real-time PCR testing and sequencing. Bovine ICV isolates had high nucleotide identities (≈98%) with each other and were closely related to human ICV strains (≈95%). Further research is needed to determine bovine ICV's zoonotic potential.,"I nfluenza viruses are contagious zoonotic pathogens that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, which consists of 4 genera: Alphainfluenzavirus (influenza A virus), Betainfluenzavirus (influenza B virus), Gammainfluenzavirus (influenza C virus [ICV]), and Deltainfluenzavirus (influenza D virus) (1) (2) (3) (4) .

,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has raised a global alert since March 2003. After its causative agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was confirmed, laboratory methods, including virus isolation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serologic methods, have been quickly developed. In this study, we evaluated four serologic tests ( neutralization test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], immunofluorescent assay [IFA], and immunochromatographic test [ICT]) for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV in sera of 537 probable SARS case-patients with correlation to the RT-PCR . With the neutralization test as a reference method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.2%, 98.7%, 98.7%, and 98.4% for ELISA; 99.1%, 87.8%, 88.1% and 99.1% for IFA; 33.6%, 98.2%, 95.7%, and 56.1% for ICT, respectively. We also compared the recombinantbased western blot with the whole virus-based IFA and ELISA; the data showed a high correlation between these methods, with an overall agreement of >90%. Our results provide a systematic analysis of serologic and molecular methods for evaluating SARS-CoV infection.","SARS was quickly identified as a new coronavirus species, now referred to as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (4) (5) (6) . With epidemiologic evidence, droplet and close contact transmission are the major routes for the spread of SARS (7) . Suspected SARS patients need to be quarantined and treated with intense care to minimize transmission to others. Therefore, sensitive and specific laboratory tests to differentiate SARS from other mild atypical pneumonia must be developed to shorten the quarantine period for contacts with SARS patients and further to contain SARS outbreaks."
Respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis: viral detection and clinical findings,"Background Viral detection from different respiratory sample types in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is facilitated by available molecular methods, but optimum sampling strategies have not been identified. In addition, associations between viral detection and respiratory symptoms are not well described.","Prior to the use of molecular detection methods to detect respiratory viruses, detection rates of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens from children with cystic fibrosis (CF) were remarkably low. 1 Viral detection in this patient population was complicated by multiple factors, including tenacious respiratory specimens that inhibited viral growth in cell culture, bacterial and fungal overgrowth contaminating respiratory specimens, and the general problems with cultivation of difficult-to-propagate respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, and other viral pathogens. The use of potentially insensitive serologic assays further hampered the detection of respiratory viral infections in this patient population. None-the-less, the association of respiratory viral infections with exacerbations of lung disease and overall progression of CF airway disease has been appreciated for a number of years. [1] [2] [3] [4] Molecular diagnostic techniques circumvent the problems associated with viral culture in children with CF and permit the detection of viruses that are extremely difficult or impossible to culture even in optimal settings. 2,5-7 Multiple viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have been clearly associated with pulmonary exacerbations and worsening lung function in children with CF. 2, 6, 8, 9 However, clinical symptoms associated with new respiratory viruses such as coronavirus and human metapneumovirus are not well described, and the symptomatic impact of rhinovirus, the most commonly detected virus in CF patients, 2, 6, 8, 9 is not We performed a 2-year prospective cohort study in school-age children with CF to compare respiratory virus detection in upper airway and sputum samples. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of respiratory viruses was performed on respiratory specimens collected during routine clinic visits and during pulmonary exacerbation. Paired upper airway and sputum samples were collected on a subset of participants within the larger cohort study, and the concordance of PCR-based viral detection between sample types was determined. The association between the detection of respiratory viruses and clinical symptoms was also evaluated."
SARS Antibody Test for Serosurveillance,for providing convalescent-phase serum samples from patients confirmed with SARS.,"A peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used for retrospective serosurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by helping identify undetected chains of disease transmission. The assay was developed by epitope mapping, using synthetic peptides from the spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein sequences of SARS-associated coronavirus. The new peptide ELISA consistently detected seroconversion by week 2 of onset of fever, and seropositivity remained through day 100. Specificity was 100% on normal blood donor samples, on serum samples associated with infection by other pathogens, and on an interference panel. The peptide-based test has advantages of safety, standardization, and automation over previous immunoassays for SARS. The assay was used for a retrospective survey of healthy healthcare workers in Taiwan who treated SARS patients. Asymptomatic seroconversions were detected in two hospitals that had nosocomial disease. R etrospective surveillance for infection is an important means to screen for and interrupt undetected chains of disease transmission. Such surveillance may be key to tracking the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) because mild and asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV infection that do not meet the World Health Organization's case definition (1) have been identified by immunoassays (2) (3) (4) , and SARS-CoV-like viruses have been isolated from wild mammals (5) . SARS-CoV may have persisted over the summer in previously affected areas in such difficult-to-recognize reservoirs (6) . The reemergence of SARS in the city of Guangzhou of the Guangdong Province of China in December 2003 and January 2004 (7) is evidence that an unknown reservoir exists and signals the need for continued surveillance with laboratory testing."

In recent years, however, the early use of steroid therapy has become progressively established in a wide range of infective conditions [1, 2] , including septic shock, its most severe systemic manifestation. We thus decided to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify the current strength of evidence for the use of corticosteroids in specified infections, and to make appropriate graded recommendations."
Respiratory virus infections in hospitalized children and adults in Lao PDR,"Background Acute respiratory infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a major burden of disease in developing countries. The relative contribution of viruses in acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) is, however, poorly documented in Lao PDR.","Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 They represent around 2 million deaths per year, especially in infants. 2 The burden of these infections is particularly important in developing countries. 3 During the last decade, South East Asia received much attention from the international scientific community due to the emergence of respiratory viruses with pandemic potential (SARS-CoV, avian influenza A/ H5N1 virus). 4 Respiratory infections can be caused by numerous viruses, including influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and human enteroviruses. Molecular techniques have become more and more popular to detect these viruses. Multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been shown to be a sensitive tool and allows identification of a majority of respiratory viruses, as well as coinfections. [5] [6] [7] In Lao PDR, the etiology of respiratory infections is still poorly documented. To improve the clinical management of the patients, limit unnecessary antibiotic use, and prevent opportunistic secondary infections, it appears important to develop surveillance and tools to assess the etiology of acute respiratory infections in this country. 8, 9 The purpose of this study was to describe during a limited period of time the viral etiology of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in patients hospitalized in two Lao hospitals by using a set of five multiplex RT-PCR/PCR targeting 18 common respiratory viruses."
Isolation and identification of a canine coronavirus strain from giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca),"Two giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) died of unknown causes in a Chinese zoo. The clinical disease profile suggested that the pandas may have suffered a viral infection. Therefore, a series of detection including virus isolation, electron microscopy, cytobiological assay, serum neutralization and RT-PCR were used to identify the virus. It was determined that the isolated virus was a canine coronavirus (CCV), on the basis of coronavirus, neutralization by canine anti-CCV serum, and 84.3% to 100% amino acid sequence similarity with CCV. The results suggest that the affected pandas had been infected with CCV.","The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an endangered animal that is treasured by humans and strictly protected by law. Currently, pandas face the threat of infectious diseases [3, 10] . It has been reported that antibodies against multiple species of viruses such as canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus (CCV) [3, 4] . However, little information is available regarding the clinical relevance and epidemiology of these pathogens in giant pandas."
Aptamers against pathogenic microorganisms,"An important current issue of modern molecular medicine and biotechnology is the search for new approaches to early diagnostic assays and adequate therapy of infectious diseases. One of the promising solutions to this problem might be a development of nucleic acid aptamers capable of interacting specifically with bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Such aptamers can be used for the specific recognition of infectious agents as well as for blocking of their functions. The present review summarizes various modern SELEX techniques used in this field, and of several currently identified aptamers against viral particles and unicellular organisms, and their applications. The prospects of applying nucleic acid aptamers for the development of novel detection systems and antibacterial and antiviral drugs are discussed.","Infectious diseases that result from the invasion of viral, bacterial or protozoan agents into a human organism are the major cause of human pathogenesis and mortality, surpassing cardiovascular diseases and cancer in both industrialized and developing countries. Infectious diseases are highly contagious and can also be easily transmitted through food and water. Taken together with an issue of hospital-acquired infections that can hardly be cured using standard therapeutics, this fact dictates a necessity to search for new approaches of fast and reliable diagnostics and treatment. Nowadays, the following methods of diagnostics of infectious diseases are broadly used (Kaittanis et al., 2010; Shinde et al., 2012) ."
A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection by dual binding to the circumsporozoite protein,"Immunization with attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) has been shown to be protective, but the features of the antibody response induced by this treatment remain unclear. To Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:","investigate this response at high resolution, we isolated IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies from Tanzanian volunteers who were immunized by repeated injection of irradiated PfSPZ and who were found to be protected from controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with infectious homologous PfSPZ. All IgG monoclonals isolated bound to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in the N-terminus, NANP repeat region, and Cterminus. Strikingly, the most effective antibodies, as assessed in a humanized mouse model, bound not only to the repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal junction that is not in the RTS,S vaccine. These dual-specific antibodies were isolated from different donors and used VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles carrying tryptophan or arginine at position 52. Using structural and mutational data, we describe the elements required for germline recognition and affinity maturation. Our study provides potent neutralizing antibodies and relevant information for lineage-targeted vaccine design and immunization strategies."
TLR agonist-Stat3 siRNA conjugates: cell-specific gene silencing and enhanced antitumor immune responses,"Efficient delivery of siRNA to specific cell populations in vivo remains a formidable challenge to its successful therapeutic application. We describe a novel siRNA-based approach -synthetically linking siRNA to an oligonucleotide TLR9 agonist -that targets and silences genes in TLR9 + myeloid cells and B cells, both of which are key components of the tumor microenvironment. Because Stat3 in tumor-associated immune cells suppresses antitumor immune responses and hinders TLR9-induced immune stimulation, we tested CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates for anti-tumor effects. When injected locally at the tumor site or systemically through an intravenous route, the CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates access tumor-associated dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, inhibit Stat3 expression, leading to activation of tumor-associated immune cells, and ultimately potent anti-tumor immune responses. Our findings demonstrate the potential of TLR agonist-",siRNA conjugates for targeted gene silencing coupled with TLR stimulation and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment.
A single T cell epitope drives the neutralizing anti-drug antibody response to natalizumab in multiple sclerosis patients,"Natalizumab (NZM), a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody to α4 integrins, is used to treat patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) 1,2 , but in about 6% of the cases persistent neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) are induced leading to therapy discontinuation 3,4 . To understand the basis of the ADA response and the mechanism of ADA-mediated neutralization,","we performed an in-depth analysis of the B and T cell responses in two patients. By characterizing a large panel of NZM-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found that, in both patients, the response was polyclonal and targeted different epitopes of the NZM idiotype. The neutralizing activity was acquired through somatic mutations and correlated with a slow dissociation rate, a finding that was supported by structural data. Interestingly, in both patients, the analysis of the CD4 + T cell response, combined with mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, revealed a single immunodominant T cell epitope spanning the FR2-CDR2 region of the NZM light chain. Moreover, a CDR2-modified version of NZM was not recognized by T cells, while retaining binding to α4 integrins. Collectively, our integrated analysis identifies the basis of T-B collaboration that leads to ADA-mediated therapeutic resistance and delineates an approach to design novel deimmunized antibodies for autoimmune disease and cancer treatment."
"Novel Orthoreovirus from Mink, China, 2011","We identified a novel mink orthoreovirus, MRV1HB-A, which seems to be closely related to human strain MRV-2tou05, which was isolated from 2 children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy in 2005. Evolution of this virus should be closely monitored so that prevention and control measures can be taken should it become more virulent.","T he family Reoviridae is a diverse group of viruses with double-stranded RNA genomes contained within icosahedral, nonenveloped, double-layered, protein capsids (1) . Members of the genus Orthoreovirus contain 10 genome segments and have been isolated from a wide variety of reptiles, birds, and mammals (including humans) (1, 2) . The mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) have 4 major serotypes: type 1 Lang, type 2 Jones,, type 3 Dearing, and type 4 Ndelle (3, 4) , which can be differentiated by neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays (5, 6) . It is well known that reovirus genomes are prone to various types of genome alterations, including intragenic rearrangement and reassortment under laboratory and natural conditions (7, 8) . Reassortment events, involving exchange of genome segments between 2 viruses, which could lead to increased virulence, are major driving forces for reovirus genome molecular diversity and evolution (9, 10) . In 1975, natural reovirus infection in mink was first described in Germany (11) . In 1992, Liu et al. also reported the isolation of a reovirus from the feces of mink with diarrhea in China (12) . However, to our knowledge, no genetic evidence of MRV strains isolated from mink has been reported."

"Recombinant Canine Coronaviruses in Dogs, Europe","Coronaviruses of potential recombinant origin with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), referred to as a new subtype (IIb) of canine coronavirus (CCoV), were recently identifi ed in dogs in Europe. To assess the distribution of the TGEV-like CCoV subtype, during 2001-2008 we tested fecal samples from dogs with gastroenteritis. Of 1,172 samples, 493 (42.06%) were positive for CCoV. CCoV-II was found in 218 samples, and CCoV-I and CCoV-II genotypes were found in 182. Approximately 20% of the samples with CCoV-II had the TGEV-like subtype; detection rates varied according to geographic origin. The highest and lowest rates of prevalence for CCoV-II infection were found in samples from Hungary and Greece (96.87% and 3.45%, respectively). Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the CCoV-IIb strains were related to prototype TGEV-like strains in the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the spike protein gene.","C oronaviruses (CoVs) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) are exceptionally prone to genetic evolution through accumulation of point mutations in genes encoding for structural and nonstructural proteins and homologous recombination among members of the same antigenic group (1) . CoVs are organized by antigenic group. The fi rst group is subdivided into subgroups 1a and 1b. Subgroup 1a includes highly related viruses (i.e., porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV] and its derivative porcine respiratory coronavirus [PRCoV] , feline coronaviruses [FCoVs] , and canine coronaviruses [CCoVs]) (2). According to a proposal by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, and given the virus' close genetic relatedness (i.e., >96% aa identity in the key replicase 1ab domains), TGEV, FCoV, and CCoV should not be considered separate viruses. Instead, they should be considered host range variants of the same species (3) ."

"Towards evidence-based, GIS-driven national spatial health information infrastructure and surveillance services in the United Kingdom","The term ""Geographic Information Systems"" (GIS) has been added to MeSH in 2003, a step reflecting the importance and growing use of GIS in health and healthcare research and practices. GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e.g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. The concepts and principles presented in this paper can be also applied in other countries, and on regional (e.g., European Union) and global levels.","""A new wave of technological innovation is allowing us to capture, store, process and display an unprecedented amount of information about our planet and a wide variety of environmental and cultural phenomena. Much of this information will be 'geo-referenced' -that is, it will refer to some specific place on the Earth's surface. The hard part of taking advantage of this flood of geospatial information will be making sense of it, turning raw data into understandable information."" -Former American Vice President Al Gore [1] The need for an evidence-based, spatio-temporal approach to public health Geography plays a major role in understanding the dynamics of health, and the causes and spread of disease [2] . The classic public health triad composed of man, agent/vehicle and environment emphasises the importance of geographic location (environment or space where we live) in health and disease. Interactions within this triad can also change with time."
Time for T? Immunoinformatics addresses vaccine design for neglected tropical and emerging infectious diseases,"Affecting more than two billion people, the neglected tropical diseases shown here lack effective vaccines. Computational vaccinology tools represent an accelerated, cost-sparing approach to vaccine design for these challenging targets. DALYs reflect global sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability as of 2010, presented with 95% UI. DALYs: Disability-adjusted life year; ND: No data; UI: Uncertainty interval. Data taken from [96]. Review Terry, Moise, Martin et al. 22 Expert Rev. Vaccines 14(1), (2015) •• One of the several studies describing HLA class II 'supertypes', that is, families of Review Terry, Moise, Martin et al.","Vaccines have been invaluable for global health, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs, while also raising the quality of human life. However, newly emerging infectious diseases (EID) and more well-established tropical disease pathogens present complex challenges to vaccine developers; in particular, neglected tropical diseases, which are most prevalent among the world's poorest, include many pathogens with large sizes, multistage life cycles and a variety of nonhuman vectors. EID such as MERS-CoV and H7N9 are highly pathogenic for humans. For many of these pathogens, while their genomes are available, immune correlates of protection are currently unknown. These complexities make developing vaccines for EID and neglected tropical diseases all the more difficult. In this review, we describe the implementation of an immunoinformatics-driven approach to systematically search for key determinants of immunity in newly available genome sequence data and design vaccines. This approach holds promise for the development of 21st century vaccines, improving human health everywhere."
Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza-like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"Background Influenza and other respiratory infections cause excess winter morbidity in children. This study assessed the economic impact of influenza-like illness (ILI) on families with children attending childcare using a societal perspective. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in 90 childcare centres and one general practitioner clinic in Sydney, Australia, during 2010. Healthy children aged ≥6 months to <3 years were enrolled. Economic impacts of ILI (temperature ≥37Á8°C or parental report of fever, plus ≥1 respiratory symptoms) were collected at 2 and 4 weeks after ILI onset by telephone interview. Parent-collected respiratory specimens were tested for respiratory viruses using realtime PCR (RT-PCR). Costs associated with healthcare visits, medication usage, carer time lost (work or recreation) and home care and/or additional childcare were collected. Influenza-like illness costs were described and further analysed using a Tobit model. Zero-inflated Poisson regression was employed to compare the numbers of healthcare visits for each ILI.","for a coronavirus and 27 for a polyomavirus. The mean cost of all ILIs was AU$626 (95% confidence interval: AU$484-768) per ILI with no significant differences observed between viruses. Carers lost on average 13 hours of work and 3 hours of leisure time per ILI. Independent drivers of ILI costs were having both parents in employed work and longer duration of ILI. In multivariate analyses, four variables were significantly associated with an increased number of healthcare visits per ILI: non-Caucasian child, living in a detached house, both parents in employed work and having an ILI with one or more viruses identified."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus Infection,"Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection can be asymptomatic is unclear. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV among 674 healthcare workers from a hospital in which a SARS outbreak had occurred. A total of 353 (52%) experienced mild self-limiting illnesses, and 321 (48%) were asymptomatic throughout the course of these observations. None of these healthcare workers had antibody to SARS CoV, indicating that subclinical or mild infection attributable to SARS-CoV in adults is rare.","T he outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, began on March 10, 2003 (1, 2) . Within the next 10 weeks, the hospital admitted 331 patients with SARS; 160 (48.3%) were healthcare workers (HCWs). Prince of Wales is a 1,350-bed teaching hospital with 3,711 employees, of whom 12% are physicians, 36% nurses, 11% allied health workers, and the remainder, administrative and ancillary staff. During the outbreak, many HCWs had been exposed directly or indirectly to aerosols, body fluids, secretions, and excretions of SARS patients. The clinical manifestations of SARS are well documented (2) (3) (4) (5) . However, we do not yet know the spectrum of clinical disease or whether mild or asymptomatic infections attributable to the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) occur. Whether subclinical infections occur and whether one may seroconvert to the SARS-CoV with minimal or no symptoms are concerns for HCWs and others."
Current progress in the development of a prophylactic vaccine for Hiv-1,"Since its discovery and characterization in the early 1980s as a virus that attacks the immune system, there has been some success for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. However, due to the overwhelming public health impact of this virus, a vaccine is needed urgently. Despite the tireless efforts of scientist and clinicians, there is still no safe and effective vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity. A vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity against HIV infection remains elusive in part due to the following reasons: 1) degree of diversity of the virus, 2) ability of the virus to evade the hosts' immunity, and 3) lack of appropriate animal models in which to test vaccine candidates. There have been several attempts to stimulate the immune system to provide protection against HIV-infection. Here, we will discuss attempts that have been made to induce sterilizing immunity, including traditional vaccination attempts, induction of broadly neutralizing antibody production, DNA vaccines, and use of viral vectors. Some of these attempts show promise pending continued research efforts.","Since its discovery and characterization in the early 1980s as a virus that attacks the immune system, leaving patients unable to fight off opportunistic infections, there has been an ebb and flow of effective treatments and hope as scientists continue to search for ways to eradicate human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) from the human population similar to what has been accomplished in the case of smallpox. The majority of the effort and nearly all of the success has come in the area of patient treatment rather than inhibition of contraction or spread of the virus. A class of treatments, antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) and later highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs), has been the mainstay of disease control during the last 15 years. Notwithstanding the increased life span of patients, increased time to full-blown AIDS, and decreased contraction of opportunistic infections and AIDS-related diseases (ie, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, etc) by patients treated with HAART, there are several reasons why development of an HIV-1 vaccine is still warranted. Five of these reasons are as follows: 1) nearly two-thirds of the patients who contract HIV-1 live in underdeveloped countries and cannot afford the expensive HAART regimen, 1 2) both the ART and HAART regimen are complex and are disruptive to patients' lives and diets, making long-term compliance an issue, 2 3) the potential side effects of ART/HAART treatments negatively affect the long-term health of patients and include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, fractures, etc, 3-5 4) development of HAART drug resistance, and 5) the presence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs harboring viral strains that were produced through mutation throughout the duration of the infection of the host also play a role in the failure of HAART. 6 These reasons, as well as many others, underscore the need for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine."
Hospital Preparedness and SARS,"On May 23, 2003, Toronto experienced the second phase of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Ninety cases were confirmed, and >620 potential cases were managed. More than 9,000 persons had contact with confirmed or potential case-patients; many required quarantine. The main hospital involved during the second outbreak was North York General Hospital. We review this hospital's response to, and management of, this outbreak, including such factors as building preparation and engineering, personnel, departmental workload, policies and documentation, infection control, personal protective equipment, training and education, public health, management and administration, follow-up of SARS patients, and psychological and psychosocial management and research. We also make recommendations for other institutions to prepare for future outbreaks, regardless of their origin.","O n March 5, 2003 , the first patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This index patient was a 78-year-old woman who, upon returning to Toronto from Hong Kong, transmitted the new variant coronavirus to her family (1). On March 7, her son was admitted to the hospital, and he subsequently died on March 13. His unrecognized disease led to nosocomial transmission of this disease in Toronto (1) . As of August 28, 2003, a total of 375 cases of suspected and probable SARS had been identified in Toronto; most of these cases occurred within healthcare facilities (1) (2) (3) . A minority of cases were related to household and community transmission, most acquired after hospital visits. The last community-acquired case of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection was identified on April 13, 2003 (2) ."
Coronavirus 3CL pro proteinase cleavage sites: Possible relevance to SARS virus pathology,"Background: Despite the passing of more than a year since the first outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), efficient counter-measures are still few and many believe that reappearance of SARS, or a similar disease caused by a coronavirus, is not unlikely. For other virus families like the picornaviruses it is known that pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases. Furthermore, several studies indicate that virus proliferation can be arrested using specific proteinase inhibitors supporting the belief that proteinases are indeed important during infection. Prompted by this, we set out to analyse and predict cleavage by the coronavirus main proteinase using computational methods.","In the spring of 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused numerous fatalities particularly in Southeast Asia and gravely affected the global economy. The causative agent was shown to be a human coronavirus [1] , a virus type which normally causes mild cold symptoms in humans. The abrupt appearance raises concern of another break-out of an epidemic of SARS virus or similar strains in the future."
"Toxicology, biodistribution and shedding profile of a recombinant measles vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 antigens, in cynomolgus macaques","As a new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine approach, the live-attenuated measles virus (MV) Schwarz vaccine strain was genetically engineered to express the F4 antigen (MV1-F4). F4 is a fusion protein comprising HIV-1 antigens p17 and p24, reverse transcriptase and Nef. This study assessed the toxicity, biodistribution and shedding profiles of MV1-F4. Cynomolgus macaques were intramuscularly immunized one or three times with the highest dose of MV1-F4 intended for clinical use, the reference (Schwarz) measles vaccine or saline, and monitored clinically for 11 or 85 days. Toxicological parameters included local and systemic clinical signs, organ weights, haematology, clinical and gross pathology and histopathology. Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no morbidity, clinical signs or gross pathological findings observed. Mean spleen weights were increased after three doses of either vaccine, which corresponded with increased numbers and/or sizes of germinal centers. This was likely a result of the immune response to the vaccines. Either vaccine virus replicated preferentially in secondary lymphoid organs and to a lesser extent in epithelium-rich tissues (e.g., intestine, urinary bladder and trachea) and the liver. At the expected peak of viremia, viral RNA was detected in some biological fluid samples from few animals immunized with either vaccine, but none of these samples contained infectious virus. In conclusion, no shedding of infectious viral particles was identified in cynomolgus monkeys after injection of MV1-F4 or Schwarz measles vaccines. Furthermore, no toxic effect in relation to the MV vaccination was found with these vaccines in this study.","The development of a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is a global health priority. During the past two decades, significant efforts have been made to develop such a vaccine. Among the few candidate HIV-1 vaccines tested in large Phase IIb or III clinical trials, only the RV144 trial, evaluating a recombinant canarypox vector prime and HIV-1 gp120 protein boost, showed a modest efficacy (31 %) against HIV-1 acquisition (reviewed by McElrath and Haynes 2010; McMichael et al. 2010) . Although ultimately, a preventive vaccine against HIV-1 inducing sterile immunity would be optimal, vaccines that would reduce viral load and disease progression by induction of strong and polyfunctional T cell responses should also prove beneficial (McMichael et al. 2010) ."
Role of macrolide therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease study has concluded that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020, and will increase its ranking of disability-adjusted life years lost from 12th to 5th. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with impaired quality of life and pulmonary function. More frequent or severe AECOPDs have been associated with especially markedly impaired quality of life and a greater longitudinal loss of pulmonary function. COPD and AECOPDs are characterized by an augmented infl ammatory response. Macrolide antibiotics are macrocyclical lactones that provide adequate coverage for the most frequently identifi ed pathogens in AECOPD and have been generally included in published guidelines for AECOPD management. In addition, they exert broad-ranging, immunomodulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as diverse actions that suppress microbial virulence factors. Macrolide antibiotics have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic, infl ammatory lung disorders including diffuse panbronchiolitis, asthma, noncystic fi brosis associated bronchiectasis, and cystic fi brosis. Data in COPD patients have been limited and contradictory but the majority hint to a potential clinical and biological effect. Additional, prospective, controlled data are required to defi ne any potential treatment effect, the nature of this effect, and the role of bronchiectasis, baseline colonization, and other cormorbidities.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects between 12 and 24 million people in the United States, where it is the fourth leading cause of death, accounting for over 106,000 deaths in 1996. Worldwide, COPD is the sixth leading cause of death (Petty 2000; Ward et al 2000; Halbert et al 2003; Wouters 2003) and is the only condition in the top 10 causes of death with an increasing prevalence and mortality (Pauwels et al 2001; Mannino et al 2002; Petty 2000; Stoller 2002) . The Global Burden of Disease study undertaken by the World Bank and the World Health Organization concluded that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020, and its ranking relative for number of disability-adjusted life-years lost will increase from 12th to 5th (Gulsvik 2001) . Currently, oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients and cigarette-smoking cessation are the only interventions known to alter the natural history of COPD."
,"To determine the prevalence of inapparent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among healthcare workers, we performed a serosurvey to test for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) among 1,147 healthcare workers in 3 hospitals that admitted SARS patients in mid-May 2003. Among them were 90 healthcare workers with SARS. As a reference group, 709 healthcare workers who worked in 2 hospitals that never admitted any SARS patients were similarly tested. The seroprevalence rate was 88.9% (80/90) for healthcare workers with SARS and 1.4% (15/1,057) for healthcare workers who were apparently healthy. The seroprevalence in the reference group was 0.4% (3/709). These findings suggest that inapparent infection is uncommon. Low level of immunity among unaffected healthcare workers reinforces the need for adequate personal protection and other infection control measures in hospitals to prevent future epidemics.","O n January 2, 2003, a patient was admitted to the Traditional Medicine Hospital, Guangdong Province, with fever, cough, decreased leukocyte count, and abnormal chest radiographs. Shortly after the patient was admitted, 7 healthcare workers who cared for him became ill with similar symptoms. This index patient was retrospectively confirmed to be the first patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangzhou (1) . Subsequently, outbreaks of SARS occurred in several hospitals (2) , and the disease rapidly spread to the Guangzhou community (1). In mid-February, the incidence of SARS reached a peak and gradually declined thereafter. When the last case was reported on May 9, 2003, a total of 1,284 probable SARS cases had been reported in Guangzhou (3) ."
Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation Reconciling competing priorities in commissioning: the future of bone densitometry service for North Wales,"Background: Osteoporosis creates brittle bones susceptible to fracture, with resulting high levels of morbidity and mortality. Poor access to bone densitometry services for the residents of North Wales led to the Welsh Assembly Government offering capital to purchase a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner, used to diagnose osteoporosis, for the region. The commissioning question for the six Local Health Boards across North Wales was where to site the new scanner. This decision needed to reflect current inequalities in access to services and concerns over inappropriate prescribing relative to Welsh norms.","Osteoporosis is a disease which creates brittle bones susceptible to fracture. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines osteoporosis in terms of bone density [1] . A woman has osteoporosis when her bone density falls more than 2.5 standard deviations below the young adult mean value. BMD measurements at the hip have the highest predictive value for hip fracture, with the WHO diagnostic criteria having a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 30% [2] ."
"Coxsackievirus A21, Enterovirus 68, and Acute Respiratory Tract Infection, China","2 rare human enterovirus serotypes, coxsackievirus A21 and enterovirus 68, were detected most frequently in human enterovirus-positive adults with acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, during some years, these 2 viruses cause a substantial proportion of enterovirus-associated adult acute respiratory tract infections.","H uman enteroviruses (HEVs) are small, nonenveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae. HEVs are classifi ed into 4 species (HEV-A to -D) according to their molecular and antigenic properties (1) . HEVs are associated with diverse clinical syndromes, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract illnesses to severe and potentially fatal conditions, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, acute fl accid paralysis, and handfoot-and-mouth disease (1) ."
DETECTION OF NON-INFLUENZA VIRUSES IN ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE-YEAR-OLD IN COTE D'IVOIRE (JANUARY -DECEMBER 2013),"Background: Influenza sentinel surveillance in Cote d'Ivoire showed that 70% of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) cases remained without etiology. This work aims to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and virological pattern of ARI that tested negative for influenza virus, in children under five years old. Materials and Methods: one thousand and fifty nine samples of patients presenting influenza Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) symptoms were tested for other respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR assays targeting 10 respiratory viruses. Results: The following pathogens were detected as follows, hRV 31,92% (98/307), hRSV 24.4% (75/329), PIV 20.5% (63/307), HCoV 229E 12,05% (37/307), hMPV 6.2% (19/307), HCoVOC43 1.0% (3/307) and EnV 1.0% (3/307). Among the 1,059 specimens analyzed, 917 (86.6%) were ILI samples and 142 (23.4%) were SARI samples. The proportion of children infected with at least one virus was 29.8% (273/917) in ILI cases and 23.9% (34/142) in SARI cases. The most prevalent viruses, responsible for ILI cases were hRV with 35.89% (98/273) and hRSV in SARI cases with 41.2% (14/34) of cases. Among the 1,059 patients, only 22 (2.1%) children presented risk factors related to the severity of influenza virus infection. Conclusion: This study showed that respiratory viruses play an important role in the etiology of ARI in children. For a better understanding of the epidemiology of ARI and improved case management, it would be interesting in this context to expand the surveillance of influenza to other respiratory viruses.","Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a real public health problem because of their high morbidity and mortality (Black et al., 2010) . The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies respiratory infections as the second leading cause of death worldwide in children under the age of five (Bryce et al., 2005) . Approximately 2.2 million children worldwide die each year of ARI and nearly 40% of these deaths occur in Africa because of limited diagnostic capacities (Williams et al., 2002) . It has been shown that viral infections play a major role in the occurrence of ARI in developed countries. In sub-Saharan Africa some work on specific viruses such as influenza (Inf) and human respiratory syncytial viruses (hRSV) have been realized but data on the occurrence of ARI remain insufficient (Tiveljung-Lindell et al., 2009 , Brittain-Long et al., 2008 . Indeed, the responsibility of viruses other than influenza in the occurrence of ARI is not yet sufficiently documented."
The Major Histocompatibility Complex: The Value of Extended Haplotypes in the Analysis of Associated Immune Diseases and Disorders,"Major histocompatibility complex antigens are critical to an animal's immune response. In most animals, the extreme polymorphism of MHC molecules complicates studies of the role of this complex in the immune response. In mice, however, MHC haplotype-homozygous inbred strains have been developed which are invaluable in the study of the immune system and the search for immune response genes. The human MHC bears many similarities to its murine equivalent with regard to antigen structure and polymorphism; furthermore, a number of combinations of specific MHC alleles between HLA-B and HLA-DR/DQ (extended haplotypes) are found in people more commonly than predicted by individual allele frequencies. Over 30 percent of Caucasian haplotypes are extended haplotypes, and over 55 percent of individuals have at least one extended haplotype. Examples of the same extended haplotype, even in unrelated individuals, should either all have or lack any gene within the MHC region. The value of considering extended haplotypes in searching for associations between the MHC and diseases, or immune response, is shown in three examples: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hepatitis B immunization, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease.","An elaborate system of host defense has evolved in animals to allow an organism to defend itself from invasion by other species. Graft rejection has proven to be an excellent test for the presence of a functional immune system. Although the recognition and rejection of foreign grafted tissues may not be a normal physiologic function, graft rejection involves processes very similar to those used in identifying viral and other foreign organisms and antigens. Studies have shown that all vertebrate animals are capable of graft rejection, and that this phenomenon correlates with the presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. The MHC is a critical factor in this self:non-self immune recognition system: MHC cell-surface proteins, antigenic determihants, and the T-cell receptor must interact in order to initiate humoral and cellular immune responses. MHC proteins are highly polymorphic, and, in recent years, additional complexities have been uncovered with the use of techniques such as 477 Abbreviations: CAH: congenital adrenal hyperplasia GVH: graft-versus-host (disease) MHC: major histocompatibility complex Supported by grants HL 29583 and HL 02033 (Transfusion Medicine Academic Award) from the isoelectric focusing and restriction fragment length polymorphisms [1] [2] [3] [4] . Such intricacies have complicated study of the role of the MHC in antibody formation in response to specific antigens, susceptibility to disease, and transplantation problems, particularly in humans."
Age-associated impaired plasmacytoid dendritic cell functions lead to decreased CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity,"Increased susceptibility to infections, particularly respiratory viral infections, is a hallmark of advancing age. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and there is a scarcity of information regarding the contribution of the innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against infections. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of advancing age on plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) function because they are critical in generating a robust antiviral response via the secretion of interferons (IFN).","Aging is characterized by an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases as the ability to fight new infections decreases, and latent infections re-emerge and increase in severity. Infections, such as influenza, pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Powers 1994; Treanor and Falsey 1999; Gavazzi et al. 2004 ), thus account for nearly one third of deaths in the aged population (Groen et al. 1998; Schildgen 2009 ). Alterations in the adaptive immune system, particularly the T cells, are thought to account for these age-related immune deficiencies. Studies have shown that aged subjects exhibit significantly lower CD8+ cytotoxic responses to influenza virus when compared with young subjects (Mbawuike et al. 1990 (Mbawuike et al. , 1993 Powers and Belshe 1993; Christensen et al. 2000; Effros et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, IFN-γ secretion from both CD4 and CD8 T cells also decreases with age (Powers and Belshe 1993; Castle et al. 1997; Kang et al. 2004) . Although the decline in T cell immunity is considered a key factor in the increased susceptibility to infections in the elderly, the impact of aging on the innate immune system is not well understood (Pawelec et al. 1998; Solana et al. 2006) . Since the innate immune system plays a crucial role in controlling pathogen invasion, and in instructing the adaptive immune system to initiate an antigenspecific response, it is important to determine the extent to which aging affects the innate immune responses."
"Primary and Secondary Human Bocavirus 1 Infections in a Family, Finland","Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) was detected in a young child hospitalized for pneumonia and subsequently in his twin brother and other family members.

Veterinary Science Molecular characterization and genogrouping of VP1 of aquatic birnavirus GC1 isolated from rockfish Sebastes schlegeli in Korea,"The cDNA nucleotide sequence of genome segment B encoding the VP1 protein was determined for the aquatic birnavirus GC1 isolated from the rockfish Sebastes schlegeli in Korea. The VP1 protein of GC1 contains a 2,538 bp open reading frame, which encodes a protein comprising 846 amino acid residues that has a predicted MW of 94 kDa. The sequence contains 6 potential Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs. Eight potential Ser phosphorylation sites and 1 potential Tyr phophorylation site were also identified. GC1 contains the Leu-Lys-Asn (LKN) motif instead of the typical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif found in other aquatic birnaviruses. We also identified the GLPYIGKT motif, the putative GTPbinding site at amino acid position 248. In total, the VP1 regions of 22 birnavirus strains were compared for analyzing the genetic relationship among the family Birnaviridae. Based on the deduced amino acid sequences, GC1 was observed to be more closely related to the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) from the USA, Japan, and Korea than the IPNV from Europe. Further, aquatic birnaviruses containing GC1 and IPNV have genogroups that are distinct from those in the genus Avibirnaviruses and Entomo-birnaviruses. The birnavirusstrains were clustered into 5 genogroups based on their amino acid sequences. The marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABVs) containing GC1 were included in the MABV genogroup; the IPNV strains isolated from Korea, Japan, and the USA were included in genogroup 1 and the IPNV strains isolated primarily from Europe were included in genogroup 2. Avibirnaviruses and entomobirnaviruses were included in genogroup 3 and 4, respectively.","Members of the family Birnaviridae have 2-segmented genomes -A and B. This family comprises 3 main genera, including the genus Aquabirnavirus, Avibirnavirus, and Entomobirnavirus [4, 19] . The type species of the genus Aquabirnavirus is the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV); the genus comprises marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABV) of fish and shellfish [3] . Other members of the family Birnaviridae include infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus, and Drosophila X virus (DVX) that belongs to the genus Entomobirnavirus. Aquatic birnaviruses are the largest and most diverse group of viruses within the family Birnaviridae. The first reported MABV was isolated from the yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata in Japan [22] , other MABVs have been subsequently isolated from various marine fishes in Korea and Japan, and their characteristics have been investigated [7, 8, 14, 18, 23, 24] . The genome segment B of birnaviruses encodes the VP1 protein, which is the presumptive virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [13, 15] . Some researchers reported the characteristics of VP1 and compared the VP1 region among birnaviruses [4, 25] . They identified several conserved domains associated with RdRps and GTP-binding proteinsin the IPNV strains; these domains were the same as those in other RNA viruses. However, they also discovered that the typical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif that is found in all RNA viruses was absent in the VP1 region of some IPNV [4] IBDV, and DXV [2] strains. The physical, antigenic, and genetic features of the VP2/NS junction region of the aquatic birnavirus GC1 isolated from the rockfish Sebastes (S.) schlegeli, which is the second most important in the aquaculture industry in Korea, has been studied [8, 9, 20] ."
"Human Betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012- related Viruses in Bats, Ghana and Europe","We screened fecal specimens of 4,758 bats from Ghana and 272 bats from 4 European countries for betacoronaviruses. Viruses related to the novel human betacoronavirus EMC/2012 were detected in 46 (24.9%) of 185 Nycteris bats and 40 (14.7%) of 272 Pipistrellus bats. Their genetic relatedness indicated EMC/2012 originated from bats.","C oronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (1) ."
,"We describe an atypical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a geriatric patient with multiple coexisting conditions. Interpretation of radiographic changes was confounded by cardiac failure, with resolution of fever causing delayed diagnosis and a cluster of cases. SARS should be considered even if a contact history is unavailable, during an ongoing outbreak.","The patient was a 90-year-old Singaporean Chinese woman who was a resident of a nursing home. She had a past history of vascular dementia with dysphagia and behavioral abnormalities, ischemic heart disease with atri-al fibrillation, and congestive cardiac failure. In addition, she also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees, and an old traumatic fracture of the left humeral neck. As such, she was fully dependent in her daily activities."
Virus detection and its association with symptoms during influenza-like illness in a sample of healthy adults enrolled in a randomised controlled vaccine trial,Background Viral respiratory infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many new aetiological agents have been described recently.,"next most common. Individuals with influenza were significantly less likely to have been immunised than the reference (virus negative) population (OR = 0AE52 (0AE31, 0AE87) P = 0AE01). The mean symptom score (95% CI) reported by individuals with influenza was significantly higher than in all other episodes [Influenza: 10AE2 (9AE4, 10AE9); Other: 7AE4 (7AE2, 7AE7); Difference (95% CI): 2AE5 (1AE5, 3AE5); P < 0AE001]. In an analysis restricted to influenza-positive cases, the symptom score was not attenuated by vaccination."
Pathogen Transmission and Clinic Scheduling,"probability of transmission from environment to caregiver; Pce, probability of transmission from caregiver to environment.; Ppe, probability of transmission from patient to environment; Pep, probability of transmission from environment to patient.","We developed a model of pathogen dissemination in the outpatient clinic that incorporates key kinetic aspects of the transmission process, as well as uncertainty regarding whether or not each incident patient is contagious. Assigning appointments late in the day to patients suspected of being infectious should decrease pathogen dissemination. P athogen dissemination within hospitals has been extensively analyzed (1) . However, it has been the subject of far fewer investigations within the outpatient clinic. We developed a model of pathogen dissemination in the outpatient clinic and explored the anticipated effects of a system-based intervention (temporal segregation of suspected infectious and noninfectious patients) and an individualbased intervention (increased compliance with hand hygiene) on the risk that an uncontaminated patient will become contaminated during a clinic visit. An annotated copy of the model, as well as more detailed simulations and supporting material, may be obtained from the corresponding author."
Potential Impact of Antiviral Drug Use during Influenza Pandemic,"The recent spread of highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza has highlighted the threat posed by pandemic influenza. In the early phases of a pandemic, the only treatment available would be neuraminidase inhibitors, which many countries are considering stockpiling for pandemic use. We estimate the effect on hospitalization rates of using different antiviral stockpile sizes to treat infection. We estimate that stockpiles that cover 20%-25% of the population would be sufficient to treat most of the clinical cases and could lead to 50% to 77% reductions in hospitalizations. Substantial reductions in hospitalization could be achieved with smaller antiviral stockpiles if drugs are reserved for persons at high risk.","R ecent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in East Asia (H5N1), Canada (H7N3), and the Netherlands (H7N7), and their subsequent transmission to humans, have intensified concern over the emergence of a novel strain of influenza with pandemic potential. Three influenza pandemics occurred during the 20th century, with varying degrees of severity; outcomes ranged from the high levels of illness and death observed during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (estimates of deaths range from 20 to 100 million [1] ) to the much lower levels observed during the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 (≈1 million deaths each [2] ). While recognizing that the characteristics of future influenza pandemics are difficult to predict, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that nations prepare pandemic contingency plans (3) . Several have been drafted, and some have been published (4) (5) (6) (7) , although all are subject to continuous refinement. Surveillance, on both a local and global scale, will enable policy makers and practitioners to act during the early phases of a pandemic. However, the likely rapid global spread of a pandemic strain will limit the time available to implement appropriate mitigating strategies, and preemptive contingency planning is needed."
Access to,"Canine rabies, responsible for most human rabies deaths, is a serious global public health concern. This zoonosis is entirely preventable, but by focusing solely upon rabies prevention in humans, this ""incurable wound"" persists at high costs. Although preventing human deaths through canine rabies elimination is feasible, dog rabies control is often neglected, because dogs are not considered typical economic commodities by the animal health sector. Here, we demonstrate that the responsibility of managing rabies falls upon multiple sectors, that a truly integrated approach is the key to rabies elimination, and that considerable progress has been made to this effect. Achievements include the construction of global rabies networks and organizational partnerships; development of road maps, operational toolkits, and a blueprint for rabies prevention and control; and opportunities for scaling up and replication of successful programs. Progress must continue towards overcoming the remaining challenges preventing the ultimate goal of rabies elimination.","Today, RNA viruses play an increasingly important role in emerging human diseases throughout the world [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . One of the main reasons for this is their ability to evolve rapidly, adapting to new species of hosts and thus to expand their range [6, 7] , including humans (i.e., new zoonotic diseases). Social and environmental changes also contribute to providing new ecological niches and promoting the rapid selection of novel virus variants [8] [9] [10] . This group of viruses includes the causative agents of rabies. As with most generalist agents of a zoonotic nature, rabies is a 2 Veterinary Medicine International very complex disease, in part because of its wide global distribution, the diverse number of virus variants and host species, its extremely high case fatality rate, and for its existence at the border between animal and human health."
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of nucleocapsid genes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains in China,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea and dehydration with high mortality rates in swine. It has become increasingly problematic in China. Since the nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly conserved, it is a candidate protein for early diagnosis and vaccine development. In this study, the N genes of 15 PEDV strains were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the pMT-19T vector, sequenced, and compared to each other as well as to PEDV reference strains. The nucleotide sequences of the N gene of the Chinese PEDV strains consist of 1326 nucleotides and encode a 441-aa-long peptide. The nucleotide sequences of the fifteen PEDV strains in our study were 96.1-100 % identical to each other, and the deduced amino acid sequences were 94.8-100 % identical. Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from Gen-Bank revealed that their nucleotide sequences were 94.2-99.7 % identical to those of the Chinese PEDV strains, and their deduced amino acid sequences were 94.1-99.5 % identical. In addition, the fifteen strains showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity to the early domestic strains (98.4-99.7 %) except the LZC strain, but less sequence identity to the vaccine strain (CV777) used in . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Chinese PEDV strains are composed of a separate cluster including three early domestic strains (JS-2004-02, LJB/03 and DX) but differ genetically from the vaccine strain (CV777) and the early Korean strains (Chinju99 and SM98).","Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating enteric disease that is characterized by severe enteritis and diarrhea, with high mortality rates in suckling pigs [1] . PED was first reported in England in 1971 [2] . Since then, PED occurs in most swine-raising countries in Europe, as well as China, Korea, Thailand, and Japan [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, this disease is becoming a big concern especially in Asia, where outbreaks are often more acute and severe than those observed in Europe [7, 8] . Since the beginning of October 2010, a porcine epidemic diarrhea epizootic has been occurring in China, affecting pigs of all ages but characterized by high mortality rates among suckling piglets. The outbreak has been prevalent nationwide and has caused huge economic losses [9] [10] [11] . Most of the affected farms have lost 100 % of their newborn piglets, usually within 7 days, but sometimes even within only a few hours of birth. Few sows or boars show any clinical signs, which is inconsistent with a previous report of an outbreak in Thailand in 2007 that was characterized by pigs of all ages being infected and showing different degrees of diarrhea and anorexia [4] . In addition, in China, sporadic outbreaks of PED have been seen year round, and not just in the winter months."
Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body,"Nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized, processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins. RNA polymerase I synthesizes the ribosomal RNAs and this activity is cell cycle regulated. The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the diVerent steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies. Perspectives on the evolution of this research area are proposed.","Brief history of the nucleolus An ovoid body visible in the nucleus was probably the Wrst observation of the nucleolus more than two centuries ago by F. Fontana. Since that time, the nucleolus has been the object of intense investigation and interestingly our vision of the nucleolus has evolved with technical progress. During the nineteenth century, using light microscopy, numerous cytologists described the variability of nucleolar morphology with great precision (Montgomery 1898) . In 1934, McClintock proposed that the ""nucleolus is organized in the telophase through the activity of ... the nucleolar-organizing body"" (McClintock 1934) . Since the nucleolar-organizing body corresponds to a speciWc region of chromosome 6 in Zea mays, this was the Wrst time the nucleolus was related to gene activity. In the 1950's the presence of RNAs in the nucleolus was demonstrated, and in the 1960's in situ hybridization techniques made it possible to identify ribosomal genes (rDNAs) in the nucleolar organizer region (NOR) (Caspersson 1950; Perry 1962; Ritossa and Spiegelman 1965) . During the same period, mass isolation of nucleoli became possible leading to the biochemical characterization of nucleolar components. Based on these results it was proposed that ribosome biogenesis occurs in nucleoli. Given that the nucleolus became a subject of great interest, the ""International symposium on the nucleolus-its structure and function"" was organized in Montevideo in 1965 and the contributions published in Natl Cancer Inst Monogr no 23 (USA) in 1966. Since 1969, at the initiative of W. Bernhard and H. Busch, ""Nucleolar Workshops"" on nucleolar organization, the biochemistry of nucleolar proteins, rRNA processing as well as variability in cancer cells were regularly organized. Several books on nucleoli were published; among them, the famous ""The nucleolus and ribosome biogenesis"" is still a very useful source of information (Hadjiolov 1985) . Between 1980 and 2000, the functional organization of the nucleolus was deciphered in large part due to the improvement of labeling by the electron microscopy (EM)."
Retrospective Evaluation of Control Measures for Contacts of Patient with Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever,"After an imported case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever was reported in 2008 in the Netherlands, control measures to prevent transmission were implemented. To evaluate consequences of these measures, we administered a structured questionnaire to 130 contacts classifi ed as either having high-risk or low-risk exposure to body fl uids of the case-patient; 77 (59.2%) of 130 contacts responded. A total of 67 (87.0%) of 77 respondents agreed that temperature monitoring and reporting was necessary, signifi cantly more often among high-risk than low-risk contacts (p<0.001). Strict compliance with daily temperature monitoring decreased from 80.5% (62/77) during week 1 to 66.2% (51/77) during week 3. Contacts expressed concern about development of Marburg hemorrhagic fever (58.4%, 45/77) and infecting a family member (40.2%, 31/77). High-risk contacts had signifi cantly higher scores on psychological impact scales (p<0.001) during and after the monitoring period. Public health authorities should specifi cally address consequences of control measures on the daily life of contacts.","I n July 2008 in the Netherlands, an imported case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) (1) was diagnosed in a person after possible exposure in a bat cave in Uganda. MHF is caused by Marburg virus, which belongs to the family Filoviridae (2, 3) . The main route of transmission is by direct contact with blood or body fl uids (4) . The virus was discovered in 1967 during a laboratory outbreak in Marburg, Germany (5, 6) . Apart from this person, since the outbreak in Marburg, MHF has been diagnosed only once outside Africa (7) ."
Early transcriptional response in the jejunum of germ-free piglets after oral infection with virulent rotavirus,"Germ-free piglets were orally infected with virulent rotavirus to collect jejunal mucosal scrapings at 12 and 18 hours post infection (two piglets per time point). IFNgamma mRNA expression was stimulated in the mucosa of all four infected piglets, indicating that they all responded to the rotavirus infection. RNA pools prepared from two infected piglets were used to compare whole mucosal gene expression at 12 and 18 hpi to expression in uninfected germ-free piglets (n = 3) using a porcine intestinal cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis identified 13 down-regulated and 17 up-regulated genes. Northern blot analysis of a selected group of genes confirmed the data of the microarray. Genes were functionally clustered in interferon-regulated genes, proliferation/differentiation genes, apoptosis genes, cytoskeleton genes, signal transduction genes, and enterocyte digestive, absorptive, and transport genes. Downregulation of the transport gene cluster reflected in part the loss of rotavirus-infected enterocytes from the villous tips. Data mining suggested that several genes were regulated in lower-or mid-villus immature enterocytes and goblet cells, probably to support repair of the damaged epithelial cell layer at the villous tips. Furthermore, up-regulation was observed for IFN-c induced guanylate binding protein 2, a protein that effectively inhibited VSV and EMCV replication in vitro (Arch Virol 150:1213-1220. This protein may play a role in the small intestine's innate defense against enteric viruses like rotavirus.","With an estimated death rate of more than 400,000 per year, mainly affecting children less than 5 years of age in developing countries, rotavirus is recognized as one of the major infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract [38] . Rotaviruses are members of the family Reoviridae, viruses with segmented double-stranded RNA genomes [17] ."

The attack rate of confi rmed infection in close contacts was 2.4% overall, ranging from 0.9% among aircraft passengers to >5% among household members. Risk factors for infection among close contacts were younger age, being a household member of an index case-patient, exposure during the index casepatient's symptomatic phase, and longer exposure. Among close contacts with positive test results at the start of quarantine, 17.2% had subclinical infection.

Real-time Forecast of Multiphase Outbreak,"We used a single equation with discrete phases to fit the daily cumulative case data from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Toronto. This model enabled us to estimate turning points and case numbers during the 2 phases of this outbreak. The 3 estimated turning points are March 25, April 27, and May 24. The estimated case number during the first phase of the outbreak between February 23 and April 26 is 140.53 (95% confidence interval ) if we use the data from February 23 to April 4; and 249 (95% CI: 246.67-251.25) at the end of the second phase on June 12 if we use the data from April 28 to June 4. The second phase can be detected by using case data just 3 days past the beginning of the phase, while the first and third turning points can be identified only ≈10 days afterwards. Our modeling procedure provides insights into ongoing outbreaks that may facilitate real-time public health responses. M athematical models have been used to predict the course of epidemics, albeit with mixed results (1). Whether and how infectious diseases are likely to spread (2-4) are affected by stochastic events (5). Once outbreaks have begun, knowing their potential severity helps public health authorities respond immediately and effectively. Much relevant information is contained in the answers to 2 questions: 1) Is the current outbreak getting better or worse? 2) How many people will be infected before the outbreak ends? Attempts to answer these questions in the early stages of an epidemic can be futile and at times misleading (6); nonetheless, we can address them with an appropriate mathematical model once sufficient time has elapsed (7). Moreover, answers can be accurate if no stochastic event occurs that could substantially alter the course of outbreaks.","M athematical models have been used to predict the course of epidemics, albeit with mixed results (1) .

Once outbreaks have begun, knowing their potential severity helps public health authorities respond immediately and effectively. Much relevant information is contained in the answers to 2 questions: 1) Is the current outbreak getting better or worse? 2) How many people will be infected before the outbreak ends? Attempts to answer these questions in the early stages of an epidemic can be futile and at times misleading (6) ; nonetheless, we can address them with an appropriate mathematical model once sufficient time has elapsed (7) . Moreover, answers can be accurate if no stochastic event occurs that could substantially alter the course of outbreaks."
NCBI Viral Genomes Resource,"to fundamentally alter our understanding of viral biology and profoundly impact public health policy. Yet, any potential benefits from the billowing cloud of next generation sequence data hinge upon well implemented reference resources that facilitate the identification of sequences, aid in the assembly of sequence reads and provide reference annotation sources. The NCBI Viral Genomes Resource is a reference resource designed to bring order to this sequence shockwave and improve usability of viral sequence data. The resource can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/ and catalogs all publicly available virus genome sequences and curates reference genome sequences. As the number of genome sequences has grown, so too have the difficulties in annotating and maintaining reference sequences. The rapid expansion of the viral sequence universe has forced a recalibration of the data model to better provide extant sequence representation and enhanced reference sequence products to serve the needs of the various viral communities. This, in turn, has placed increased emphasis on leveraging the knowledge of individual scientific communities to identify important viral sequences and develop well annotated reference virus genome sets.","Recent outbreaks of Ebolavirus (1, 2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (3, 4) clearly demonstrate the power of sequence analysis in viral surveillance, host reservoir identification and public health policy debate. As these viruses have filled media headlines, their genome sequences have spilled into international public databases. Such real time analysis promises to fundamentally alter our understanding of viral biology and significantly impact public health responses to viral dis-ease, but it also places renewed emphasis on public research infrastructure that is necessary to support the storage and analysis of sequence data. This infrastructure includes primary databases that together comprise the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (5) , GenBank (6) , European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) (7) , and DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ) (8) , and reference databases like the ViralZone Resource at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (http://viralzone.expasy. org) (9) and the Viral Genome Resource at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/) (10) . Whereas primary databases are archival repositories of sequence data, reference databases provide curated datasets that enable a number of activities, among them are transfer annotation to related genomes (11) (12) (13) , sequence assembly and virus discovery (14) (15) (16) (17) , viral dynamics and evolution (18) (19) (20) and pathogen detection (14, (21) (22) (23) ."
,"A Ab bs st tr ra ac ct t Although most epidemic human infectious diseases are caused by recently introduced pathogens, cospeciation of parasite and host is commonplace for endemic infections. Occasional host infidelity, however, provides the endemic parasite with an opportunity to survive the potential extinction of its host. Such infidelity may account for the survival of certain types of human lice, and it is currently exemplified by viruses such as HIV.","Hans Zinsser's Rats, Lice and History [1] is a classic in microbiology. Written in 1934 and subtitled The biography of a bacillus, it tells the tale of that dreaded disease typhus, its reservoir in rats and its transmission among humans by lice. Here, I discuss how we may in the course of prehistory have acquired the lice, and how other infections may, like the typhus bacillus, come to be shared by us and the animal species with which we are in close contact. It is a tale of infidelity that I shall begin with the recent research on lice of David Reed and colleagues [2, 3] and of Mark Stoneking's group [4] who, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, have speculated that we may have acquired a clade of head lice from another hominid species and pubic lice from gorillas; they have also suggested that lice might help determine the date when humans adopted clothing. I shall examine this unfolding story in the context of what we know about microbial infections, and will look at the promiscuity of viruses through the lens of modern molecular technology; and I will add my own speculation on why naked apes have pubic hair."
,"By screening rabbits with enterocolitis or enteritis complex and asymptomatic rabbits, we identifi ed a novel astrovirus. The virus was distantly related (19.3%-23.7% aa identity) in the capsid precursor to other mammalian astroviruses within the Mamastrovirus genus. By using realtime reverse transcription PCR, with specifi c primers and probes and targeting a conserved stretch in open reading frame 1b, we found rabbit astrovirus in 10 (43%) of 23 samples from animals with enteric disease and in 25 (18%) of 139 samples from asymptomatic animals in Italy during 2005-2008. The mean and median titers in the positive animals were 10 2 × and 10 3 × greater, respectively, in the symptomatic animals than in the asymptomatic animals.

Deubiquitylating Enzymes and DNA Damage Response Pathways,"Covalent post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like factors has emerged as a general mechanism to regulate myriad intracellular processes. The addition and removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from factors has recently been demonstrated as a key mechanism to modulate DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. It is thus, timely to evaluate the potential for ubiquitin pathway enzymes as DDR drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The synthetic lethal approach provides exciting opportunities for the development of targeted therapies to treat cancer: most tumours have lost critical DDR pathways, and thus rely more heavily on the remaining pathways, while normal tissues are still equipped with all DDR pathways.

"MERS Coronavirus in Dromedary Camel Herd, Saudi Arabia",A prospective study of a dromedary camel herd during the 2013-14 calving season showed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection of calves and adults. Virus was isolated from the nose and feces but more frequently from the nose. Preexisting neutralizing antibody did not appear to protect against infection.,"We studied dromedaries at 2 farms in Al-Hasa, 4-5 km apart. Farm A had 70 animals; 4 were 1 month of age, 8 were ≈1 year of age, and the rest were adults (>2 years of age). The herd did not go to pasture in the desert (""zero-grazing""; type of grazing may influence types of potential exposures). The animals were sampled on 5 occasions during November 2013-February 2014. Farm B (""semi-zero-grazing"") had 17 adults and 3 calves; its herd was sampled in February 2014. Nasal, oral, or rectal swab samples and blood samples were collected (Table 1;  online Technical Appendix Table, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/20/7/14-0571-Techapp1.pdf).

Merging Economics and Epidemiology to Improve the Prediction and Management of Infectious Disease Original Contribution,"Mathematical epidemiology, one of the oldest and richest areas in mathematical biology, has significantly enhanced our understanding of how pathogens emerge, evolve, and spread. Classical epidemiological models, the standard for predicting and managing the spread of infectious disease, assume that contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals depend on their relative frequency in the population. The behavioral factors that underpin contact rates are not generally addressed. There is, however, an emerging a class of models that addresses the feedbacks between infectious disease dynamics and the behavioral decisions driving host contact. Referred to as ''economic epidemiology'' or ''epidemiological economics,'' the approach explores the determinants of decisions about the number and type of contacts made by individuals, using insights and methods from economics. We show how the approach has the potential both to improve predictions of the course of infectious disease, and to support development of novel approaches to infectious disease management.","Economic behavior is known to play a key role in disease transmission. Throughout history, new pathogens have emerged with the opening of new markets or trade routes. The Black Death in the fourteenth century, and the sixteenth century Columbian exchange-which brought smallpox and typhus to the Americas, and syphilis to Europe, are the bestknown examples (McNeill 1977; Yoo et al. 2010 ). In the last few decades, the growth of global trade and travel have been implicated in the emergence of human infectious diseases such as plague, cholera, HIV (Tatem et al. 2006a, b) , West Nile virus (Lanciotti et al. 2000) , SARS (Guan et al. 2003; Hufnagel et al. 2004) , as well as livestock diseases such as H9N2 Avian influenza, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Bluetongue or Foot and Mouth disease (Rweyemamu and Astudillo 2002; Karesh et al. 2005; Fevre et al. 2006; Purse et al. 2008) , and diseases of wildlife-potentially white-nose syndrome in bats (Pikula et al. 2012) . In the USA, many other wildlife diseases and zoonoses have been linked to live animal imports (Smith et al. 2009a) . Trade and travel affect the likelihood that pathogens are spread internationally by altering the number and variety of infectious-susceptible contacts Jones et al. 2008; Suhrcke et al. 2011; Daszak 2012; Kilpatrick and Randolph 2012) . In the same way, the decisions people make to engage with others in their own community affect the spread of disease nationally. Since people take account of potential disease risks, it is possible to analyze the spread of disease as a function of the costs and benefits of disease risk management."
High-Affinity Recognition of HIV-1 Frameshift-Stimulating RNA Alters Frameshifting in Vitro and Interferes with HIV-1 Infectivity,"The life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has an absolute requirement for ribosomal frameshifting during protein translation in order to produce the polyprotein precursor of the viral enzymes. While an RNA stemloop structure (the ""HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Signal"", or HIV-1 FSS) controls the frameshift efficiency and has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target, developing compounds that selectively bind this RNA and interfere with HIV-1 replication has proven challenging. Building on our prior discovery of a ""hit"" molecule able to bind this stem-loop, we now report the development of compounds displaying high affinity for the HIV-1 FSS. These compounds are able to enhance frameshifting more than 50% in a dual-luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney cells, and they strongly inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV-1 virions.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), remains a significant challenge to global health. 1, 2 Since its initial identification in 1983, HIV-1 infection has reached the status of a pandemic. In 2009 alone, there were approximately 2.7 million new infections and about 2.0 million deaths from AIDS related causes. 3 Currently there is no cure for HIV-1 infection. While progression of the disease can be controlled by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of drugs designed to inhibit different stages in the virus' life cycle, 4 the complexity of the HAART regimen, and the ability of the virus to evolve resistance suggest that alternative drug targets for HIV-1 treatment and prophylaxis are needed. 5 One potentially attractive target for pharmacological interference in the HIV-1 life cycle is the virus' requirement for a programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF) in order to express its enzymes. 6 Ribosomal frameshifting is a recoding mechanism common among viruses with polycistronic (multiple open reading frames, or ORFs, in a single gene) genomes. It allows viruses to translate polypeptides in different ORFs by avoiding the stop codon(s) present in the single mRNA transcript. In HIV-1, the pol gene is in the −1 reading frame with respect to gag. Gag, the precusor of the viral structural proteins, is produced via normal translational rules, while Pol, the precursor of the viral enzymes, is synthesized as a fused Gag-Pol polyprotein via −1 PRF. This occurs with a frequency of 5−10% of ribosomes translating the full-length viral mRNA. A critical molar ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag protein is required for HIV-1 replication and infectivity; alterations to this ratio have been shown to be detrimental. 7 −1 PRF in HIV-1 is controlled by two cis acting mRNA elements: a heptameric slippery sequence (U UUU UUA), with the 0 frame indicated by spaces and where the frameshift actually occurs, and a downstream two-stem helix immediately following the slippery sequence, also known as the frameshift stimulatory signal (HIV-1 FSS, Figure 1 ). 8 While several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the frameshift, 9 it is currently hypothesized that this event results from an incomplete translocation for a limited number of ribosomes, due to resistance of the FSS to unwinding. 10−12 These ribosomes then start translation of pol in the new −1 reading frame. Modification of the slippery site or stimulatory sequence (either via natural variation or laboratory mutations) in ways affecting frameshifting efficiency translates to a decrease in viral replication. 13, 14 These and other results have led several groups to propose −1 PRF as a potential target for developing antiretroviral agents for HIV-1. 6,15−17 NMR structural analyses indicate that the HIV-1 FSS RNA consists of a G-C rich upper stem-loop structure, 18 separated from a flexible lower stem by a GGA trinucleotide bulge ( Figure 1 ). 19, 20 The bulge produces a roughly 60°bend between the upper and lower stems. The upper stem-loop is exceptionally stable. This stability is believed to play a vital role in the stimulation of the frameshift, since the ribosome must unwind the stem during translation. The lower stem is thermodynamically less stable. The highly structured ACAA tetraloop is uncommon among tetraloops 21 but is conserved among all HIV-1 group M subtypes except the uncommon H and J subtypes. Likewise, the heptameric slippery sequence is conserved across all HIV-1 group M subtypes. SHAPE analysis of the intact HIV genome suggests a more complex structure for the FSS RNA, although the upper stem-loop is retained. 22, 23 Since other viruses also rely on frameshifting, 24 targeting frameshift-regulating structures may have general utility beyond the context of HIV. For example, human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2) uses two −1 PRF events similar to HIV-1 in order to synthesize fused Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol precursor proteins. 25 The RNA responsible for the −1 PRF essential for expression of Gag-Pro in HTLV-2 also consists of two cis-acting RNA elements, a heptanucleotide (AAAAAAC) slippery site and a stem-loop shown in Figure 1 . 26 This HTLV-2 FSS served as a sequence specificity control in the experiments we describe herein."
"Distinct Lineage of Vesiculovirus from Big Brown Bats, United States Technical Appendix Materials and Methods Sample collection and viral metagenomic sequencing","In 2008, >500 bats associated with possible human exposure were submitted to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene State Laboratory for the postmortem diagnosis of rabies by direct fluorescent antibody assay. The carcasses of the bats negative for rabies were kept frozen at 80°C. A total of 120 bats were selected for necropsy, including 30 individuals for each of the following categories: juvenile male, juvenile female, adult male and adult female. The lungs and livers were dissected from the bats and pooled for virus purification and metagenomic sequencing according to previously described protocols (1,2). In short, virus particles were purified from the tissues using homogenization, filtration and nuclease treatment.","The complete genome of the American bat vesiculovirus (ABVV) was obtained by Sanger dideoxy sequencing of PCR products obtained using combinations of primers designed throughout the genome (Technical Appendix Figures 1 and 2 ) and the 5 and 3 extremities were obtained using Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE). PCR primers were designed from metagenomic contigs using PRIMER3 (5) . PCRs were performed using LA Taq (Clontech) with reagent concentrations according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were carried out with a ""universal touch-down PCR"" suitable for the melting temperatures of all primers, as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles of [94°C for 1 min, 58°C minus 0.2°C per cycle for 1 min, 72°C for 1 to 5 min], followed by 72°C for 10 min. Amplicons were sequenced to their entirety by Sanger sequencing. The 5 and 3 genome extremities were amplified using RACE amplification kits (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and previously described protocols (4) ."
Induction of type I interferon by RNA viruses: cellular receptors and their substrates,"Virus recognition and induction of interferon (IFN) are critical components of the innate immune system. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptor families have been characterized as key players in RNA virus detection. Signaling cascades initiated by these receptors are crucial for establishment of an IFN signaling mediated antiviral state in infected and neighboring cells and containment of virus replication as well as initiation of the adaptive immune response. In this review, we focus on the diverse and overlapping functions of these receptors, their physiological importance, and respective viral inducers. We highlight the roles of TRL3, TLR7/8, retinoic acid inducible gene I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and the RNA molecules responsible for activating these viral sensors.","The phenomenon of host directed viral interference has been observed for many years, with some descriptions dating back to observations made by Jenner in 1804 in reference to herpes virus infections interfering with vaccinia virus lesion developments. Supporting these initial reports, more controlled studies with numerous bacteria, plant, and animal viruses followed in the 1930s and 1940s and further confirmed the viral interference phenomena. A thorough and detailed review by Henle describes many pioneering studies and provides numerous examples of initial reports of viral interference (Henle 1950) . These early studies varied widely in their approach with some using live or inactivated virus as an interfering agent and challenging with either the same or different species of virus. Through hindsight, it becomes clear that many of these initial experiments were not relevant to the action of interferon but could be attributed to other phenomena where the end result was inhibition of viral infection. Nevertheless, numerous important and relevant observations were made in those early years of research and placing these initial findings in the context of current molecular biology knowledge provides a deeper understanding of the field and also highlights areas in need of elucidation."

The goal of this study was to describe patterns of all-cause mortality among residents of Tianjin, China."
,"Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) was established in 1995 as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network to assess the extent of invasive bacterial infections of public health importance. ABCs is distinctive among surveillance systems because of its large, population-based, geographically diverse catchment area; active laboratory-based identification of cases to ensure complete case capture; detailed collection of epidemiologic information paired with laboratory isolates; infrastructure that allows for more in-depth investigations; and sustained commitment of public health, academic, and clinical partners to maintain the system. ABCs has directly affected public health policies and practices through the development and evaluation of vaccines and other prevention strategies, the monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance, and the response to public health emergencies and other emerging infections.","A ctive Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs), a program in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network, was launched in 1995 as part of the CDC strategy to address the worldwide threat of emerging infectious diseases (1) .

Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Infl uenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Infl uenza,"Avian infl uenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian infl uenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal infl uenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specifi c for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against infl uenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between infl uenzaspecifi c CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These fi ndings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal infl uenza vaccination.","I nfl uenza viruses are segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. According to the antigenic differences in nucleoprotein and matrix proteins, 3 types of infl uenza viruses (A, B, and C) have been described. Infl uenza viruses A and B are associated with seasonal illness and death, whereas infl uenza virus C causes mild infections (1, 2) . Infl uenza A viruses are subtyped on the basis of the antigenic differences on external hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins. Human type A infl uenza virus subtypes have been limited to H1, H2, and H3 and to N1 and N2 (3) . Several HAs and NAs have been isolated from avian hosts; occasionally, they have been associated with human outbreaks (4, 5) ."
Review Lipoquality control by phospholipase A 2 enzymes,"The phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) family comprises a group of lipolytic enzymes that typically hydrolyze the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to give rise to fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The mammalian genome encodes more than 50 PLA 2 s or related enzymes, which are classified into several subfamilies on the basis of their structures and functions. From a general viewpoint, the PLA 2 family has mainly been implicated in signal transduction, producing bioactive lipid mediators derived from fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Recent evidence indicates that PLA 2 s also contribute to phospholipid remodeling for membrane homeostasis or energy production for fatty acid O-oxidation. Accordingly, PLA 2 enzymes can be regarded as one of the key regulators of the quality of lipids, which I herein refer to as lipoquality. Disturbance of PLA 2 -regulated lipoquality hampers tissue and cellular homeostasis and can be linked to various diseases. Here I overview the current state of understanding of the classification, enzymatic properties, and physiological functions of the PLA 2 family.","In terms of signal transduction, the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) reaction, which hydrolyzes the sn-2 position of phospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids, has been considered to be of particular importance, since arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4), one of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) released from membrane phospholipids by PLA 2 , is metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs) to lipid mediators including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs), which are often referred to as eicosanoids (Fig. 1) ."
,"Disaster management plans have traditionally been required to manage major traumatic events that create a large number of victims. Infectious diseases, whether they be natural (e.g. SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] and influenza) or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill into our already strained hospital systems. With proper planning, hospitals, health care workers and our health care systems can be better prepared to deal with such an eventuality. This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in the SARS outbreak disaster. Our health care system and, in particular, our critical care system were unprepared for this event, and as a result the impact that SARS had was worse than it could have been. Nonetheless, we were able to organize a response rapidly during the outbreak. By describing our successes and failures, we hope to help others to learn and avoid the problems we encountered as they develop their own disaster management plans in anticipation of similar future situations.","The Commission recognizes the skill and dedication of so many individuals in the Ontario public health system and those volunteers from Ontario and elsewhere who worked beyond the call of duty … They faced enormous workloads and pressures in their tireless fight, in a rapidly changing environment, against a deadly mysterious disease. The strength of Ontario's response lay in the work of the people who stepped up and fought SARS. What went right in a system where so much went wrong, is their dedication … [1] Disaster management plans have traditionally been required to manage major traumatic events that create a large number of victims. Infectious diseases, whether they be natural or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill patients, and disaster management planning should take such eventualities into account. This need was demonstrated in February 2003, when a new illness -SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) -spread from the People's Republic of China to 28 countries, resulting in 8096 probable cases with 774 deaths [2] . This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in a disaster outbreak situation. By sharing our experiences and our coping strategies, we hope that others will learn from our successes and avoid the problems we encountered, many of which were a direct result of lack of preparedness. We hope that this review will encourage others to make plans to cope with similar outbreaks in the future, should they occur."
Urine Peptidomic and Targeted Plasma Protein Analyses in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,"Purpose Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic pediatric disease. The initial clinical presentation can mimic other pediatric inflammatory conditions, which often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and appropriate therapy. SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. Experimental Design We profiled the urine peptidome to analyze a set of 102 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI), and healthy controls. A set of 91 plasma samples, from SJIA flare and quiescent patients, were profiled using a customized antibody array against 43 proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes. Results We identified a 17-urine-peptide biomarker panel that could effectively discriminate SJIA patients at active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Targeted sequencing of these peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters from seven different proteins, suggesting diseasespecific proteolytic activities. The antibody array plasma profiling identified an SJIA plasma flare signature consisting of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), interleukin (IL)-18, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin.","Clinical Relevance Sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarkers for systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) would allow its differentiation from other febrile illnesses, such as Kawasaki disease (KD) or acute infections (febrile illness (FI)) and facilitate prompt initiation of appropriate treatment at disease onset. Early treatment may reduce the risk of long-term complications and subsequent disabilities. In addition, biomarkers that distinguish intercurrent SJIA flare from infection in patients with known SJIA would be clinically useful, as would markers that predict impending disease flare or responder status to particular therapies, or provide an early indication of a treatment response. Finally, biomarkers may provide clues to unanswered questions concerning SJIA pathogenesis. Our comparative analysis of SJIA, KD, and FI urine peptidomes identified a small subset of the urine peptidome that effectively discriminates SJIA patients in the active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and also discriminates patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Urine peptide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers could be of clinical use, especially for serial sampling of pediatric SJIA patients. Targeted sequencing revealed that these peptide markers fall into several tight clusters indicating SJIA-specific proteolytic events. Plasma cataloging analysis of the normal plasma peptidome shows that at least some of these nested peptide markers originate in the circulation. A customized antibody array was used to compare the plasma abundance of proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes, revealing a SJIA flare signature. Taken altogether, the urine peptidomic and plasma protein and peptide analyses suggest a testable model that SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may be an outcome of inflammation-driven effects on catabolic pathways operating at multiple sites."
Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates: pathogen detection and inactivation methods,"Whereas the reduction of transfusion related viral transmission has been a priority during the last decade, bacterial infection transmitted by transfusion still remains associated to a high morbidity and mortality, and constitutes the most frequent infectious risk of transfusion. This problem especially concerns platelet concentrates because of their favorable bacterial growth conditions. This review gives an overview of platelet transfusion-related bacterial contamination as well as on the different strategies to reduce this problem by using either bacterial detection or inactivation methods.","Reduction of transfusion related viral transmission such as HIV, HBV or HCV has been a priority for blood transfusion services. Implementation of antibody screening followed by nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT) introduced in blood donor screening during the last decade, have largely contributed to this reduction. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Nevertheless, all blood products remain under the threat of emerging blood-transmitted infections (virus, protozoans, helminths, bacteria, prions) 6 and bacterial transfusion related transmission is still associated to a high morbidity and mortality. [1] [2] [3] 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] Platelets are especially affected by this risk, and septic infections are most commonly associated with platelet transfusion because of the favorable bacterial growth conditions that are: i) room temperature storage allowing the growth of even small bacterial inoculums and, ii) the biological composition of platelet concentrates. [3] [4] [5] 9, 11, 12 The estimated rate of bacterial platelet contamination is about 1/2,000-3,000 units (wholeblood and apheresis-derived platelets) 1-3,5 and a severe sepsis may be associated with one out of 6 of contaminated platelet units transfused. 3 The risk of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates has been estimated to be 50-250 times higher than the combined risk of HIV, HBV, HCV and HTLV-1/2. 9 Transfusion related sepsis is often not recognized, and the real clinical and fatal prevalence are probably underestimated. 10 Platelet transfusion-related bacterial contamination: some data"

,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which emerged in the United States in 2013, has spread throughout North America. Limited availability of PEDV complete genomes worldwide has impeded our understanding of PEDV introduction into the United States. To determine the relationship between the North American strains and global emerging and historic PEDV strains, we sequenced and analyzed complete genomes of 74 strains from North America; the strains clustered into 2 distinct clades. Compared with the initially reported virulent US PEDV strains, 7 (9.7%) strains from 4 states contained insertions and deletions in the spike gene (S INDELs). These S INDEL strains share 99.8%-100% nt identity with each other and 96.2%-96.7% nt identity with the initial US strains. Furthermore, the S IN-DEL strains form a distinct cluster within North American clade II, sharing 98.6%-100% nt identity overall. In the United States, the S INDEL and original PEDV strains are cocirculating and could have been introduced simultaneously.","P orcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae family, genus alphacoronavirus) has an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of ≈28 kb (1). The 5′ two thirds of the genome contains 2 large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, that encode 2 nonstructural polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, that direct genome replication and transcription. The remaining PEDV genome contains ORFs specifying structural and nonstructural proteins in the following order: spike (S), ORF 3, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) (2, 3) ."
Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV) Pneumonia in Beef Calf Herds Despite Vaccination,"Larsen LE, Tegtmeier C, Pedersen E: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) pneumonia in beef calf herds despite vaccination. Acta vet. scand. 2001, 42, 113-121. -The present report describes the clinical, pathological, serological and virological findings in calves from 2 larger Danish beef herds experiencing outbreaks of pneumonia. The calves had been vaccinated with an inactivated bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) vaccine 2 months prior to the outbreak. The clinical signs comprised nasal discharge, pyrexia, cough and increased respiratory rates. A total of 28 calves died in the 2 herds. The laboratory investigations revealed that BRSV was involved and probably initiated both outbreaks. Furthermore, the serological results suggested that the vaccine induced only sparse levels of antibodies probably due to the presence of maternally derived antibodies at the time of vaccination. Necropsy findings in 5 calves revealed changes typical for infectious pneumonia with involvment of BRSV. In conclusion, vaccination of calves against BRSV in 2 Danish beef herds failed to protect the calves against severe or even fatal BRSV mediated respiratory disease 2 months later.","Respiratory disease is one of the most important health problems in young Danish cattle with substantial financial losses for the industry (Tegtmeier et al. 1999 , Uttenthal et al. 1996 . Thus, approximately 20% of the materials from bovines submitted to The Danish Veterinary Laboratory (DVL) for necrosy originate from cattle with a history of respiratory symptoms. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) has been recognised in recent years as the major viral component of the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex (Larsen 2000) . This is based on the high prevalence of seropositive individuals (Uttenthal et al. 2000 , Uttenthal et al. 1996 and the strong correlation between respiratory disease and detection of the virus in diagnostic samples (Larsen et al. 1999 ). BRSV has a predilection for the lower respiratory tract and may damage the respiratory tract epithelium directly followed by changes induced by, i.e. inflammatory mediators (Kimman et al. 1989a ) and/or it may increase the ability of bacteria to invade the lung and cause a secondary bacterial infection (Babiuk et al. 1988) . So far it has not been possible to prove a clear link between protection and level of actively produced or passively acquired antibodies in natural BRSV infection. Thus, calves less that 6 months are most frequently infected with BRSV despite the presence of maternally derived antibodies. Furthermore, reinfections occur even in sero-positive calves (Van der Poel et al. 1993) . Antibodies may be partly protective, however, since the incidence and severity of disease seems to be inversely related to the level of specific maternal antibodies (Kimman et al. 1988) . Several inac-tivated and modified live BRSV vaccines are commercially available in North-America and Europe, yet none have been registered for use in Denmark (September, 2000) . In 1997 approximately 20 Danish beef herds, with confirmed BRSV positive status, received a temporary permission to use an inactivated vaccine against BRSV in calves. The present report describes the clinical, pathological, serological and virological findings in vaccinated calves in 2 Danish beef herds experiencing outbreaks of pneumonia in January 1998."
Rational Design of Peptide Vaccines Against Multiple Types of Human Papillomavirus Supplementary Issue: Novel Data Analytics in Biomedical Informatics and Translational Medicine,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) occurs in many types, some of which cause cervical, genital, and other cancers. While vaccination is available against the major cancer-causing HPV types, many others are not covered by these preventive measures. Herein, we present a bioinformatics study for the designing of multivalent peptide vaccines against multiple HPV types as an alternative strategy to the virus-like particle vaccines being used now. Our technique of rational design of peptide vaccines is expected to ensure stability of the vaccine against many cycles of mutational changes, elicit immune response, and negate autoimmune possibilities. Using the L1 capsid protein sequences, we identified several peptides for potential vaccine design for HPV 16, 18, 33, 35, 45, and 11 types. Although there are concerns about the epitope-binding affinities for the peptides identified in this process, the technique indicates possi bilities of multivalent, adjuvanted, peptide vaccines against a wider range of HPV types, and tailor-made different combinations of the peptides to address frequency variations of types over different population groups as required for prophylaxis and at lower cost than are in use at the present time.","Certain types of cancers such as liver cancer, cervical cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and others are caused by viruses, for some of which vaccines are well established. Vaccines operate by triggering immune response in an individual. It has been shown that under some circumstances immunocompetent individuals can protect themselves against primary tumor development. 1 It is also established that while a healthy immune system can act as a tumor suppressor, in other cases it might facilitate tumor progression. 2 Nevertheless, given the wide variety of viral cancers and progression of the disease, using the immune system to prevent cancer through antiviral vaccines could be a reasonable procedure. Some viral cancers such as those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B viruses have been effectively prevented through such techniques."
"Effects of School Closures, 2008 Winter Infl uenza Season, Hong Kong","In winter 2008, kindergartens and primary schools in Hong Kong were closed for 2 weeks after media coverage indicated that 3 children had died, apparently from infl uenza. We examined prospective infl uenza surveillance data before, during, and after the closure.

We then considered the effects of the school closures on community transmission.
"Ebola Risk Perception in Germany, 2014","Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have occurred during the past 5 decades, but none has affected European countries like the 2014 epidemic in West Africa. We used an online questionnaire to investigate risk perceptions in Germany during this epidemic peak. Our questionnaire covered risk perceptions, knowledge about transmission routes, media use, reactions to the outbreak, attitudes toward measures to prevent the spread of EVD and vaccination against EVD, and willingness to volunteer for aid missions. Of 974 participants, 29% indicated that they worried about EVD, 4% correctly stated virus transmission routes, and 75% incorrectly rated airborne transmission and transmission by asymptomatic patients as possible. Many indicated that if a patient were flown to Germany for treatment in a nearby hospital, they would adapt preventive behavior. Although most participants were not worried about EVD at the current stage of the epidemic, misperceptions regarding transmission were common and could trigger inappropriate behavior changes.","M isperceptions of risk can lead to inappropriate reactions during epidemics (1, 2) , such as stigmatization of those who are perceived as possible sources of infection (3) . With regard to Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the West African countries most affected by the outbreak in 2014, indications are strong that societal misperceptions contributed to the outbreak spread (4) . Public perceptions even in countries not directly affected by the EVD outbreak might influence outbreak response (e.g., by the priorities governments will set or by the willingness of persons to volunteer for aid missions in the affected countries) (5, 6) ."
Real-time Estimates in Early Detection of SARS,"We propose a Bayesian statistical framework for estimating the reproduction number R early in an epidemic. This method allows for the yet-unrecorded secondary cases if the estimate is obtained before the epidemic has ended. We applied our approach to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that started in February 2003 in Hong Kong. Temporal patterns of R estimated after 5, 10, and 20 days were similar. Ninety-five percent credible intervals narrowed when more data were available but stabilized after 10 days. Using simulation studies of SARSlike outbreaks, we have shown that the method may be used for early monitoring of the effect of control measures.","T he reproduction number R of an epidemic (the mean number of secondary cases infected by a single infectious case) is a key parameter for the analysis of infectious diseases because it summarizes the potential transmissibility of the disease and indicates whether an epidemic is under control (R<1). Up to now, this parameter has only been estimated retrospectively for periods from which all secondary cases had been detected. In terms of policy development and evaluation during the epidemic, obtaining estimates of the temporal trends in the reproduction number relating to as recent a time as possible would be critical."
,"A virulent avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was isolated from 30-day-old broiler chickens that exhibited respiratory symptoms, nephropathologic lesions, and a high proportion of deaths in the People's Republic of China during 2005. The strain, designated YN, was genetically and pathologically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that YN and most of the previously characterized IBV isolates found in China were phylogenetically classifi ed into 2 main genetic clusters. The YN isolate caused severe lesions and resulted in deaths of 65% in experimental infections of 30-day-old specifi c-pathogen-free chickens. Tracheal and severe kidney lesions developed in all infected birds, confi rming the ability of YN strain to induce both respiratory and renal disease. IBV antigens were detected by immunohistochemical analysis in the trachea, lung, kidney, and bursa, consistent with histopathologic observations, virus isolation, and reverse transcription PCR detection. We showed that YN IBV exhibits severe pathogenicity in chickens, and that similar viruses are prevalent in China.","A vian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, causes a highly contagious respiratory and sometimes urogenital disease of chickens that is characterized by respiratory signs, nephritis, or reduced egg production and quality in layer chickens. IBV is a major poultry pathogen that is endemic worldwide and leads to serious economic losses."
,"The fi rst human virus in the genus Cardiovirus was described in 2007 and named Saffold virus (SAFV). Cardioviruses can cause severe infections of the myocardium and central nervous system in animals, but SAFV has not yet been convincingly associated with disease in humans. To study a possible association between SAFV and infections in the human central nervous system, we designed a realtime PCR for SAFV and tested cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) samples from children <4 years of age. SAFV was detected in 2 children: in the CSF and a fecal sample from 1 child with monosymptomatic ataxia caused by cerebellitis; and in the CSF, blood, and myocardium of another child who died suddenly with no history of illness. Virus from each child was sequenced and shown to be SAFV type 2. These fi ndings demonstrate that SAFV can cause serious invasive infection in children.","M olecular biology has revolutionized the diagnostics of infectious diseases through the introduction of more sensitive and specifi c diagnostic tests. Despite these advances, the etiologic agents of many apparent infections are still unidentifi ed. For example, the etiologic agent is unknown for many cases of apparent pneumonia (1); in a study conducted in California, USA, despite extensive testing and evaluation, an underlying cause of encephalitis was unidentifi ed for 207 (62%) of 334 patients (2) ."
Enhancing Laboratory Response Network Capacity in South Korea,"Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories help protect populations from biological and chemical public health threats. We examined the role of LRN biological laboratories in enhancing capacity to detect and respond to public health infectious disease emergencies in South Korea. The model for responding to infectious disease emergencies leverages standardized laboratory testing procedures, a repository of standardized testing reagents, laboratory testing cooperation among hospital sentinel laboratories and reference laboratories, and maintenance of a trained workforce through traditional and on-demand training. Cooperation among all network stakeholders helps ensure that laboratory response is an integrated part of the national response. The added laboratory testing capacity provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention LRN assets helps protect persons who reside in South Korea, US military personnel and civilians in South Korea, and those who reside in the continental United States.","(CDC), in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, developed the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) as part of the strategic infrastructure that keeps the United States safe from intentional and naturally occurring public health threats (1) . The LRN has a broad capacity to detect biological and chemical public health threats. LRN laboratories that detect and identify biological threat agents, such as Bacillus anthracis, ricin toxin, or variola virus, are referred to as LRN-B laboratories; those that detect chemical agents are called LRN-C laboratories. The LRN-B comprises clinical, food, veterinary, environmental, and agricultural laboratories that work together to detect and identify agents that have historically been considered potential weapons of mass destruction (2) . The LRN-B currently has 139 reference microbiology laboratories; ≈100 laboratories are in the United States, and member laboratories (which have access to LRN-B assets) are in Canada, Australia, and South Korea (Figure 1 ). Increasing the number of LRN-B laboratories worldwide can help countries more rapidly detect, respond to, and contain public health emergencies at their source and thereby enhance global health security."
,"hospital with pneumonia had evidence of recent B. pertussis infection. In these persons, whether B. pertussis is a primary or secondary pathogen or an innocent bystander is not clear. Further work is needed to clarify the precise role of B. pertussis in developing adult pneumonia, the risk factors for B. pertussis-associated pneumonia, and the value of specific B. pertussis therapy in this setting. These data will also help inform about the role of pertussis vaccination in adults.","Measures, Singapore and Japan"
Mice Susceptible to SARS Coronavirus,"Murine models of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) will greatly advance research on this emerging virus. When BALB/c mice were simultaneously inoculated intranasally and orally, replication of SARS-CoV was found in both lung and intestinal tissue.","T he outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that emerged in China in November 2002 was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that was detected in lungs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and feces of infected patients (1) (2) (3) (4) . This outbreak in humans is striking because of the high rate of illness and death associated with it. The SARS-CoV outbreak likely resulted from zoonotic transmission, and natural animal reservoirs of viruses nearly identical to SARS-CoV increase the likelihood of its reemergence in humans (5) ."

,"Several studies investigated associations of IFN-c rs2430561 T/A, IL28B rs12979860 C/T and ERa rs2077647 T/C gene polymorphisms with outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but the results were controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of all published observational studies to address this inconsistency. Literature was searched in online database and a systematic review was conducted based on the search results. A total of 24 studies were included and dichotomous data were presented as odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The rs2430561 T allele was associated with reduced persistent HBV infection risk (T vs. A: OR, 0.690; 95% CI, [0.490, 0.971]), while the rs2077647 T allele significantly increased the risk of persistent HBV infection (T vs. C: OR, 1.678; 95% CI, [1.212, 2.323]). Rs 2077647 CC might play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence (TT vs. CC: OR, 4.109; 95% CI, [2.609, 6.473]). Furthermore, carriers of the rs2430561 TT genotype were more likely to clear HBV spontaneously compared with those of the AA genotype (TT vs. AA: OR, 0.555; 95% CI, [0.359, 0.856])","Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) appears under different forms of evolution, ranging from the asymptomatic and self-limited infection to the chronic state, which can develop into chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1] . So far, factors that determine the variable outcomes of HBV infection are little known. Besides pathogenesis of virus, environment factors, ethnic differences and genetic susceptibility have also been reported to have an effect on the progression of this liver disease [2] . Recently, a number of studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of cytokines have a correlation with the outcomes of HBV infection [3, 4] . However, controversies exist among similar studies."
Patients and Methods Patients,"For many encephalitis cases, the cause remains unidentifi ed. After 2 children (from the same family) received a diagnosis of acute necrotizing encephalopathy at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (Tours, France), we attempted to identify the etiologic agent. Because clinical samples from the 2 patients were negative for all pathogens tested, urine and throat swab specimens were added to epithelial cells, and virus isolates detected were characterized by molecular analysis and electron microscopy. We identifi ed a novel reovirus strain (serotype 2), MRV2Tou05, which seems to be closely related to porcine and human strains. A specifi c antibody response directed against this new reovirus strain was observed in convalescent-phase serum specimens from the patients, whereas no response was observed in 38 serum specimens from 38 healthy adults. This novel reovirus is a new etiologic agent of encephalitis.","Orthoreovirus, are nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses with a genome composed of 10 segments. These viruses have 3 major serotypes: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), and type 3 Dearing (T3D), which can be differentiated by neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests (1) . A fundamental characteristic of these viruses, because of their segmented genome, is that 2 distinct viruses can infect the same cell and combine their genomes, thus generating novel viruses (2) . The acronym reovirus (respiratory enteric orphan virus) is used to designate viruses isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of persons with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms (3) . Although reovirus infection of humans usually induces mild symptoms, infection of newborn mice leads to severe pathologic conditions, such as lethal encephalitis, depending on the inoculation route and strain (4, 5) . Previous studies have described the isolation of 3 reovirus strains after cell culture of cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) from patients with meningitis: serotype 1 (6), serotype 3 (T3C96) (7) , and serotype 2 (T2W) (8, 9) . The etiologic role of the T2W strain in meningitis could not be ascertained because the patient was co-infected with other agents (8) . Similarly, new mammalian reoviruses, such as BYD1, JP, and BYL, were isolated from throat swab specimens of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (10) . Similarly, Melaka virus (11) , Kampar virus (12) , and HK23629/07 virus (13) were isolated from adults with acute respiratory infection. Here, we report the isolation of a novel human type 2 reovirus (named MRV2Tou05) from 2 children hospitalized with acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). Virologic, molecular, and serologic methods were used to detect the MRV2Tou05 strain."
The effect of spent bleaching earth ageing process on its physicochemical and microbial composition and its potential use as a source of fatty acids and triterpenes,"This study was aimed at investigating the physicochemical and microbiological changes that took place during the ageing process of spent bleaching earth in the presence of autochthonous microorganisms. Research material included fresh spent bleaching earth (SBE 0 ) and the same material after 3 years of storage at the constant temperature of 20°C, without aeration and moistening (SBE 3 ). Changes in the chemical composition of analysed waste material were observed during its ageing process point to a spontaneous bioconversion of fat substance towards formation and/or release of free saturated fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0 (14.3 g 100 g −1 D.M.), triterpenes (8.48 g 100 g −1 D.M.), cholesterol (3.29 g 100 g −1 D.M.), small quantities of carbohydrates and esters (0.80 g 100 g −1 D.M.). This process was accompanied by other changes in physicochemical parameters of the waste material, such as colour, odour and viscosity, decrease in fat content from 28.27 to 24.6 % and that of soluble forms of metals (Mo, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr and Mn), ranging from 25 to 75 %, and an increase in pH, from 3.85 to 4.2. At the same time, changes in the microbial consortium were observed.","Waste generation is an inseparable part of economic activity, and therefore, it is reasonable to minimise both the quantity of generated waste materials as well as their negative environmental impact. In the waste management scheme being valid throughout the EU, there are to be found in the order of priority such sections as recovery of usable components and recycling of components which cannot be directly used Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 19 November 2008 (European Parliament 2008 . However, waste disposal, particularly through landfilling, is still a disagreeable and undesirable necessity (European Council 1999) ."
The influence of locked nucleic acid residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2 0 -O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes,"The influence of locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2 0 -O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes is reported. Optical melting studies indicate that LNA incorporated into an otherwise 2 0 -O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide usually, but not always, enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA. Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3 0 terminal U LNA and 5 0 terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3 0 terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2 0 -O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2 0 -O-methyl nucleotide. An equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA when at least one 2 0 -O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides. The sequence dependence of 2 0 -Omethyl RNA/RNA duplexes appears to be similar to that of RNA/RNA duplexes, and preliminary nearestneighbor free energy increments at 37 C are presented for 2 0 -O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes. Internal mismatches with LNA nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with RNA.","Understanding the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplexes is important for many reasons. For example, such knowledge facilitates design of ribozymes (1), antisense and RNAi oligonucleotides (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) , diagnostic probes including those employed on microarrays (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) and structures useful for nanotechnology (24) (25) (26) (27) . Many modified residues have been developed for such applications. Examples include propynylated bases (28) (29) (30) , peptide nucleic acids (5, (31) (32) (33) , N3 0 -P5 0 phosphoramidates (34-38) and 2 0 -O-alkyl RNA (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) . A modification that is particularly stabilizing in DNA and RNA duplexes (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) is a methyl bridge between the 2 0 oxygen and 4 0 carbon of ribose to form a 'locked nucleic acid' or LNA as shown in Figure 1 . McTigue et al. (48) have shown that the enhanced stability due to a single LNA residue in a DNA duplex can be predicted from a nearestneighbor model."
Hypothesis High-throughput virtual screening and docking studies of matrix protein vp40 of ebola virus,"Ebolavirus, a member of the Filoviridae family of negative-sense RNA viruses, causes severe haemorrhagic fever leading up to 90% lethality. Ebolavirus matrix protein VP40 is involved in the virus assembly and budding process. The RNA binding pocket of VP40 is considered as the drug target site for structure based drug design. High Throughput Virtual Screening and molecular docking studies were employed to find the suitable inhibitors against VP40.

Coronavirus membrane-associated papain-like proteases induce autophagy through interacting with Beclin1 to negatively regulate antiviral innate immunity,"Autophagy plays important roles in modulating viral replication and antiviral immune response. Coronavirus infection is associated with the autophagic process, however, little is known about the mechanisms of autophagy induction and its contribution to coronavirus regulation of host innate responses. Here, we show that the membrane-associated papain-like protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) of coronaviruses acts as a novel autophagyinducing protein. Intriguingly, PLP2-TM induces incomplete autophagy process by increasing the accumulation of autophagosomes but blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Furthermore, PLP2-TM interacts with the key autophagy regulators, LC3 and Beclin1, and promotes Beclin1 interaction with STING, the key regulator for antiviral IFN signaling. Finally, knockdown of Beclin1 partially reverses PLP2-TM's inhibitory effect on innate immunity which resulting in decreased coronavirus replication. These results suggested that coronavirus papain-like protease induces incomplete autophagy by interacting with Beclin1, which in turn modulates coronavirus replication and antiviral innate immunity.","Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process which plays an important role in eliminating damaged organelles and long-live proteins for maintenance of cellular homestasis (Mizushima, 2009) . During autophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes that are destined for fusion with lysosomes for content degradation. Under stress conditions such as starvation, autophagic acitivity is greatly augmented from its basal levels, providing recyclable resources that help maintain metabolism and ATP levels for cell survival (Rabinowitz and White, 2010) . Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in various physiologic and pathologic processes including cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolism, viral infections and immune response, etc. (Deretic, 2012; Levine and Deretic, 2007; Mihaylova and Shaw, 2011; Shintani and Klionsky, 2004; Yang et al., 2011) ."
SARS-CoV Antibody Prevalence in All Hong Kong Patient Contacts,"A total of 1,068 asymptomatic close contacts of patients with severe acute respiratory (SARS) from the 2003 epidemic in Hong Kong were serologically tested, and 2 (0.19%) were positive for SARS coronavirus immunoglobulin G antibody. SARS rarely manifests as a subclinical infection, and at present, wild animal species are the only important natural reservoirs of the virus.","S ince severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that causes it have emerged and spread, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology, pathogenesis, and epidemiologic features of both the virus and the disease. Epidemiologic studies of hospitalized patients suggest that the overall transmissibility of SARS (as indicated by the basic reproductive number R 0 = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-3.7) (1) is relatively low compared to other pathogens. However, such studies could not take into account possible episodes of mild or moderate illness that did not require inpatient medical care and could not address whether asymptomatic community spread played a role in the 2003 epidemic. If this type of spread occurred, sufficient herd immunity against SARS-CoV to protect against another large-scale outbreak might have been developed in the population. The full spectrum of disease associated with SARS-CoV infection should be examined to define more precisely what constitutes a case requiring quarantine and isolation to minimize potential human-tohuman spread. Understanding these issues requires the systematic study of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV antibody in a large sample stratified by age and other baseline characteristics, especially since children were disproportionately less affected by SARS, both in terms of reduced incidence and severity of infection. Serologic surveys can be based on a random sample from the total population with appropriate stratification, on serum collected for other reasons (e.g., blood donors, all hospital admissions), or on surveys of persons who resided in sites of superspreading events or who have had close contact with a confirmed SARS patient."
Norovirus Infection in Harbor Porpoises Technical Appendix Rescue and Rehabilitation of Small Cetaceans,"Since 1967, small cetaceans-mainly harbor porpoises-that strand alive along the coasts of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany have been rehabilitated at the Dolfinarium Harderwijk (Harderwijk, the Netherlands) and subsequently released into the wild. Since 2004,","this activity has been organized in the form of an independent foundation, SOS Dolphin which operates at the same site. The SOS Dolphin Foundation has two 50-m 3 pools with fresh water to which salt is added. In the first period of rehabilitation, animals are observed 24 hours per day, and standard parameters are recorded, including respiration rate, cramps, food intake, and defecation. In addition, other potentially relevant observations are recorded, including swimming behavior and alertness. As an animal improves, the level of observation and care diminish to a minimum of 9 hours per day. Admission and rehabilitation of live-stranded wild harbor porpoises at the SOS Dolphin Foundation was authorized by the government of the Netherlands (application no. FF/75/2012/036). The tissues and fecal material were collected during necropsies of stranded wild harbor porpoises, animals that died despite intensive care or were euthanized because of severe clinical signs in the absence of any indication of future recovery."
"Targeting Human Immunodefi ciency Virus Type 1 Assembly, Maturation and Budding","The targets for licensed drugs used for the treatment of human immunodefi ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are confi ned to the viral reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and the gp41 transmembrane protein (TM). While currently approved drugs are effective in controlling HIV-1 infections, new drug targets and agents are needed due to the eventual emergence of drug resistant strains and drug toxicity. Our increased understanding of the virus life-cycle and how the virus interacts with the host cell has unveiled novel mechanisms for blocking HIV-1 replication. This review focuses on inhibitors that target the late stages of virus replication including the synthesis and traffi cking of the viral polyproteins, viral assembly, maturation and budding. Novel approaches to blocking the oligomerization of viral enzymes and the interactions between viral proteins and host cell factors, including their feasibility as drug targets, are discussed.","HIV-1 is a major public health problem affecting an estimated 40 million individuals worldwide (www. unaids.org). Although it has been over 20 years since HIV-1 was identifi ed as the etiologic cause of acquired immune defi ciency syndrome (AIDS) an effective vaccine is not available. Thus, apart from public health measures that aim at HIV-1 prevention, the only effective strategy for controlling HIV-1 infections and lowering HIV-1 transmission is the use of antiretroviral drugs either for the treatment or prevention of infections."
Collecting Data To Assess SARS Interventions,"With cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurring across geographic regions, data collection on the effectiveness of intervention strategies should be standardized to facilitate analysis. We propose a minimum dataset to capture data needed to examine the basic reproduction rate, case status and criteria, symptoms, and outcomes of SARS. F irst detected in China, confirmed and probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have now appeared in at least 30 countries in five continents. SARS is the first new severe infectious disease to occur in the 21st century, and little is known about its epidemiologic features (1). To assess the effect of SARS on public health and outcomes, data are needed about who becomes ill, how they contracted their illness, and the sequelae.","With cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurring across geographic regions, data collection on the effectiveness of intervention strategies should be standardized to facilitate analysis.

,"Understanding the dynamics of infl uenza transmission on international fl ights is necessary for prioritizing public health response to pandemic incursions. A retrospective cohort study to ascertain in-fl ight transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and infl uenza-like illness (ILI) was undertaken for 2 long-haul fl ights entering Australia during May 2009. Combined results, including survey responses from 319 (43%) of 738 passengers, showed that 13 (2%) had an ILI in fl ight and an ILI developed in 32 (5%) passengers during the fi rst week post arrival. Passengers were at 3.6% increased risk of contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 if they sat in the same row as or within 2 rows of persons who were symptomatic prefl ight. A closer exposed zone (2 seats in front, 2 seats behind, and 2 seats either side) increased the risk for postfl ight disease to 7.7%. Effi ciency of contact tracing without compromising the effectiveness of the public health intervention might be improved by limiting the exposed zone.","in Mexico and the United States, with rapid spread to Europe, Asia, and the Pacifi c, is testament to the ease of spread of infectious disease across the globe (1). The World Health Organization activated level 5 pandemic alert on April 29, 2009, when sustained community transmission of the pandemic virus was demonstrated in Mexico and the United States. In her address to the United Nations on May 4, 2009 , Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, called for heightened vigilance to limit international spread of the virus (2). Australia's response was rapid, with the introduction of a number of measures as outlined in the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Infl uenza, 2008 (3) . These measures included in-fl ight messages to incoming passengers, use of health declaration cards by all incoming travelers, and mandatory reporting by the pilot on the health status of crew and passengers before landing (4) . The novel virus was also listed as a quarantinable disease under Australia's Quarantine Act 1908, which allows for the application of public health powers for intervention (5) ."
CD13/Aminopeptidase N overexpression by basic fibroblast growth factor mediates enhanced invasiveness of 1F6 human melanoma cells,"CD13/Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is known to play an important role in tumour cell invasion. We examined whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is involved in the regulation of CD13 expression in human melanoma cells. 1F6 human melanoma cells were stably transfected with constructs encoding either the 18 kDa (18kD) or all (ALL) bFGF isoform proteins. We observed highly increased CD13 mRNA and protein expression in the 1F6 clones regardless of the overexpression of either the 18kD or all isoform proteins. Neutral aminopeptidase activity was increased five-fold and could be inhibited by bestatin and the CD13-neutralising antibody WM15. The enhanced invasion through Matrigel, but not migration in a wound assay, was efficiently abrogated by both bestatin and WM15. Upregulation of CD13 expression was the result of increased epithelial and myeloid promoter activity up to 4.5fold in 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones. Interestingly, in a panel of human melanoma cell lines, a significant correlation (r 2 ¼ 0.883, Po0.05) between bFGF and CD13 mRNA and protein expression was detected. High bFGF and CD13 expression were clearly related with an aggressive phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that high bFGF expression upregulates CD13 expression in human melanoma cells by activating both the myeloid and the epithelial CD13 promoter. In addition, we show that high bFGF and CD13 expression results in enhanced invasive capacity and metastatic behaviour of human melanoma cells.","Cutaneous melanoma is a type of skin cancer with high metastatic potential. Melanoma cells can express a wide variety of (angiogenic) growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). During tumour development, melanoma cells depend on the autocrine production of these growth factors for proliferation and survival (Rodeck, 1993; Halaban, 1996) Most specifically, bFGF appears to be a key signal in melanoma progression. Basic fibroblast growth factor is involved in proliferation, migration and invasion of tumour cells (Bikfalvi et al, 1997) We here report that bFGF overexpression in human melanoma cells is responsible for upregulation of CD13 resulting in a highly increased invasive capacity."
"Follow-up of Contacts of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-Infected Returning Travelers, the Netherlands, 2014",Notification of 2 imported cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the Netherlands triggered comprehensive monitoring of contacts. Observed low rates of virus transmission and the psychological effect of contact monitoring indicate that thoughtful assessment of close contacts is prudent and must be guided by clinical and epidemiologic risk factors.,", mostly from countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Travel-related cases have been reported in Europe, Asia, and the United States, with limited, local, person-to-person secondary transmission (3) ."
Detecting Emerging Diseases in Farm Animals Detecting Emerging Diseases in Farm Animals,"Predicting emerging diseases is among the most difficult challenges facing researchers and health managers. We present available approaches and tools to detect emerging diseases in animals based on clinical observations of farm animals by veterinarians. Three information systems are described and discussed: Veterinary Practitioner Aided Disease Surveillance in New Zealand, the Rapid Syndrome Validation Project-Animal in the United States, and ""émergences"" in France. These systems are based on syndromic surveillance with the notification of every case or of specific clinical syndromes or on the notification of atypical clinical cases. Data are entered by field veterinarians into forms available through Internetaccessible devices. Beyond challenges of implementing new information systems, minimizing economic and health effects from emerging diseases in animals requires strong synergies across a group of field partners, in research, and in international animal and public health customs and practices.","A fter the discovery of antimicrobial drugs, the increased knowledge in pathogenesis, and the improvement of health management, infectious diseases were thought to be a concern restricted to the application of known control measures. However, the dramatic spread of highly pathogenic diseases such as AIDS and multidrugresistant bacterial infections led the scientific community to seriously examine emerging infectious diseases (1) . Additionally, most of the emerging issues for humans are zoonotic (2) (e.g., avian influenza, bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , West Nile virus fever). Consequently, emerging diseases are now being addressed in domestic animals and wildlife with greater interest (3) ."

Thin-Section Computed Tomography Manifestations During Convalescence and Long- Term Follow-Up of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) This work is licensed under Creative Common Attribution- NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0),"SARS is not only an acute disease, but also leads to long-term impaired lung diffusing capacity in some survivors. However, there is a paucity of data regarding long-term CT findings in survivors after SARS. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in lung function and lung thin-section computed tomography (CT) features in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially the dynamic changes in ground-glass opacity (GGO).","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emergent infectious disease that was epidemic in 2002 and 2003 [1] . Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China infected about 8000 people and led to 774 recorded deaths, mostly in Hong Kong [1] . Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to 37 countries [2] . A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is responsible for SARS.

Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia in Swine Associated with Porcine Circovirus Type 2 Infection,"Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a chronic respiratory disease. Although the pathogenesis of BOOP is still incompletely understood, BOOP is responsive to steroids and has a good prognosis. In our five pigs with chronic postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), typical BOOP lesions were revealed. All five porcine lungs showed typical intraluminal plugs, and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was identified. They also exhibited similar pathologic findings such as proliferation of type II pneumocytes and myofibroblasts (MFBs), extracellular collagen matrix (ECM) deposition, and fragmentation of elastic fibers. MFBs migration correlative molecules, for instance, gelatinase A, B and osteopontin, appeared strongly in the progressing marginal area of polypoid intraluminal plugs of fibrotic lesion. These molecules colocalized with the active MFBs. Both gelatinase activity and intercellular level of active MFBs were significantly increased (P < .05). Porcine chronic bronchopneumonia leads to BOOP and it is associated with PCV2 persistent infection. Swine BOOP demonstrates similar cellular constituents with human BOOP. Perhaps their molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis operate in a similar way. Thus we infer that the swine BOOP can be considered as a potential animal model for human BOOP associated with natural viral infection. Moreover, it is more convenient to obtain samples.","Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), described firstly in 1901 [1] , was clarified as a distinct histopathological and clinical entity in 1985 [2] . It is characterized by the proliferation of fibroblastic tissues, extending as polypoid plugs from lamina propria into the lumen of terminal and respiratory bronchioles. Additional features include a patchy inflammatory process involving mononuclear inflammatory cells in interalveolar septa [3] . Although the pathogenesis of BOOP is still incompletely understood, BOOP is responsive to steroids and has, in the vast majority of cases, a good prognosis."
Distinctive clinical features of human bocavirus in children younger than 2 years,"Background and objective Clinical characteristics of human bocavirus (HBoV) infection have been studied worldwide, but their importance of those characteristics remains unknown. We investigated distinctive clinical features of HBoV-positive children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Methods and results During April 2007-July 2009, for 402 hospitalized children younger than 2 years with LRTI, we prospectively examined virus genomes in nasopharyngeal swabs for HBoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenzavirus, and adenovirus. The HBoV genomes were identified in 34 patients (8.5%). Clinical and laboratory data of HBoV-positive and other virus/bacteria-negative patients (n=18) were analyzed and compared with data of RSV-single positive patients (n=99). The seasonal distribution of HBoV exhibits a concentration of cases during March-September, with most RSV cases occurring during winter in Japan. The minimum age of HBoV-positive patients was 5 months, although 44 patients (44%) with RSV were younger than 6 months. The main clinical features were respiratory distress and hypoxia. Hypoxia advances within 3 days after onset. The mean oxygen saturation on arrival was 92.8%, which was significantly lower than that in patients with RSV (p< 0.001). White blood cell counts were similar among groups. However, the percentage of neutrophils in white blood cells were significantly higher in HBoV-positive patients (62 vs. 45%, p<0.001). Their prognoses were good. Their hospital stays were 6.6 days. Conclusions HBoV-single positive patients show several clinical characteristics, such as seasonality, age, hypoxia, and neutrophilia, which differ from those with RSV infection.","Pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in infants and young children [6] . During the past decade, detection of various respiratory viruses has improved by virtue of new molecular techniques and the availability of monoclonal antibodies for many viral species. New viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [28] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [11, 16, 23] , and human bocavirus (HBoV) are reportedly major pathogens of human respiratory infection."
"Comparisons of substitution, insertion and deletion probes for resequencing and mutational analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays","Although oligonucleotide probes complementary to single nucleotide substitutions are commonly used in microarray-based screens for genetic variation, little is known about the hybridization properties of probes complementary to small insertions and deletions. It is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of disease-related genes. Here, we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions, and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene. Over 68 different dye-labeled single-stranded nucleic acid targets representing all ATM coding exons were applied to these microarrays. We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra-and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions. Overall, these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing and mutational analysis. e33 of specific sequence variants by sequencing even when dealing with slightly ambiguous hybridization data.","Oligonucleotide microarrays are a powerful technological platform for large-scale screens of common genetic variation and disease-causing mutations (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In most published studies (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) , oligonucleotide microarrays are designed to screen specific sequence tracts, up to megabases in length (11, 15, 22, 23) , for all possible single nucleotide substitutions. With some exceptions (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) , the same emphasis was not placed on identifying all possible small insertions and deletions in the heterozygous state. Nevertheless, it is crucial to detect such small insertions and deletions since they can play a major role in inactivating or altering gene function by disrupting functional elements (e.g. splice junctions, cis-acting elements and open reading frames) and also represent another class of common genetic variation."
Targeted Delivery of siRNA,"Therapeutic application of siRNA requires delivery to the correct intracellular location, to interact with the RNAi machinery within the target cell, within the target tissue responsible for the pathology. Each of these levels of targeting poses a significant barrier. To overcome these barriers several strategies have been developed, such as chemical modifications of siRNA, viral nucleic acid delivery systems, and nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems. Here, we discuss progress that has been made to improve targeted delivery of siRNA in vivo for each of these strategies.","The functional mediators of RNA interference (RNAi) are small interfering RNAs (siRNA) [1, 2] . These doublestranded RNA molecules are typically 19 to 23 nucleotides in length, and consequently have a molecular weight of approximately 13 to 15 kd and 38 to 46 negative charges. As a consequence, passive transport over the lipophilic cell membrane is poor [3] [4] [5] . At the same time, intracellular entry and translocation into the cytoplasm (and/or nucleus), where the RNAi machinery is located, is a prerequisite, for gene silencing activity [6] [7] [8] [9] . More importantly, for in vivo applications, intracellular entry into the target cell within the diseased tissue is required and should lead to appearance in the cytoplasm to silence the mRNA of interest ( Figure 1 ). Ideally, siRNA should therefore be targeted to three levels: to the target tissue, the target cell type, and the subcellular compartment."
Preparedness of institutions around the world for managing patients with Ebola virus disease: an infection control readiness checklist Preparedness of institutions around the world for managing patients with Ebola virus disease: an infection control readiness checklist,"Background: In response to global concerns about the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD), outbreak to-date in West Africa documented healthcare associated transmission and the risk of global spread, the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC) Infection Control Working Group created an Ebola Infection Control Readiness Checklist to assess the preparedness of institutions around the globe. We report data from the electronic checklist that was disseminated to medical professionals from October to December 2014 and identify action needed towards better preparedness levels. Findings: Data from 192 medical professionals (one third from Africa) representing 125 hospitals in 45 countries around the globe were obtained through a specifically developed electronic survey. The survey contained 76 specific questions in 7 major sections: Administrative/operational support; Communications; Education and audit; Human resources, Supplies, Infection Prevention and Control practices and Clinical management of patients. The majority of respondents were infectious disease specialists/infection control consultants/clinical microbiologists (75; 39 %), followed by infection control professionals (59; 31 %) and medical doctors of other specialties (17; 9 %). Nearly all (149; 92 %) were directly involved in Ebola preparedness activities. Whilst, 54 % indicated that their hospital would need to handle suspected and proven Ebola cases, the others would subsequently transfer suspected cases to a specialized centre. Conclusion: The results from our survey reveal that the general preparedness levels for management of potentially suspected cases of Ebola virus disease is only partially adequate in hospitals. Hospitals designated for admitting EVD suspected and proven patients had more frequently implemented Infection Control preparedness activities than hospitals that would subsequently transfer potential EVD cases to other centres. Results from this first international survey provide a framework for future efforts to improve hospital preparedness worldwide.","On 8th August, 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [1, 2] . The Ebola virus disease outbreak had an unprecedented rate of increase with 22,500 reported cases and nearly 9000 deaths as of 4 February 2015 [1] . Furthermore, cases exported to other countries made this a global concern and both a medical and public health crisis [3] . WHO recommended all nations to implement public health measures to respond to the suspected and confirmed EVD cases and for the international community to strengthen their support towards the affected countries [4, 5] . As pointed out in the Lancet [5] , however, there are no incentives or sanctions in place for failing to build capacity to implement such measures. Whilst, infections related to cross-transmission, similar to the ones seen in Dallas, USA and Spain, will probably remain sporadic in the more developed regions around the globe, the widespread transmission in healthcare facilities in the three countries most badly affected emphasizes the need for hospitals to be prepared. It is imperative to understand the current situation in the diverse healthcare facilities globally, in order to be better prepared for Ebola and any future emerging infectious diseases."
CPT-cGMP Is A New Ligand of Epithelial Sodium Channels,"Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are localized at the apical membrane of the epithelium, and are responsible for salt and fluid reabsorption. Renal ENaC takes up salt, thereby controlling salt content in serum. Loss-of-function ENaC mutations lead to low blood pressure due to salt-wasting, while gain-of-function mutations cause impaired sodium excretion and subsequent hypertension as well as hypokalemia. ENaC activity is regulated by intracellular and extracellular signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, protein kinases, and small compounds. Cyclic nucleotides are broadly involved in stimulating protein kinase A and protein kinase G signaling pathways, and, surprisingly, also appear to have a role in regulating ENaC. Increasing evidence suggests that the cGMP analog, CPT-cGMP, activates αβγ-ENaC activity reversibly through an extracellular pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the parachlorophenylthio moiety and ribose 2'-hydroxy group of CPT-cGMP are essential for facilitating the opening of ENaC channels by this compound. Serving as an extracellular ligand, CPT-cGMP eliminates sodium self-inhibition, which is a novel mechanism for stimulating salt reabsorption in parallel to the traditional NO/cGMP/PKG signal pathway. In conclusion, ENaC may be a druggable target for CPT-cGMP, leading to treatments for kidney malfunctions in salt reabsorption.","Cyclic guanosine monophosphates (cGMP) are important cyclic nucleotides, playing a critical role in signal transduction in many different organisms 1 . Signal transduction in eukaryotic cells is essential for moderating the transmission of information through the cell membrane, and as a second messenger, cGMP regulates numerous essential processes in cells by amplifying external signals, for example, from hormones and neurotransmitters. Cytosolic cGMP binds to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels 1, 2 and phosphorylates protein kinase G (PKG) directly [3] [4] [5] ."
Lactate dehydrogenase as a marker of nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during viral upper respiratory infection: implications for acute otitis media,"Background-Acute otitis media (AOM) is a frequent complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). We hypothesized that severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury during URI, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS), is related to AOM complication.","Acute otitis media (AOM) mostly occurs during or after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and is highly prevalent among young children (1) (2) . The pathogenesis of AOM is complex and involves interactions between the host, pathogen and environmental factors. Usually, there is a pre-existing nasopharyngeal colonization with pathogenic bacteria. Viral URI causes inflammation of the nasopharynx and Eustachian tubes, which is mediated by substances such as cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The inflammation leads to Eustachian tube dysfunction, which in turn causes a negative pressure in the middle ear allowing the pathogens from the nasopharynx to enter the middle ear resulting in fluid or pus accumulation, thereby causing AOM (1) (2) . However, while nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during symptomatic viral URI occurs in all children, AOM complication occurs in only about one third of young children. It is likely that more severe nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury leads to higher risk for AOM; however, this postulate has not been studied in clinical setting."

"Superspreading SARS Events, Beijing, 2003 EMERGENCE OF SARS","Superspreading events were pivotal in the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We investigated superspreading in one transmission chain early in Beijing's epidemic. Superspreading was defined as transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts. An index patient with onset of SARS 2 months after hospital admission was the source of four generations of transmission to 76 case-patients, including 12 healthcare workers and several hospital visitors. Four (5%) case circumstances met the superspreading definition. Superspreading appeared to be associated with older age (mean 56 vs. 44 years), case fatality (75% vs. 16%, p = 0.02, Fisher exact test), number of close contacts (36 vs. 0.37) and attack rate among close contacts (43% vs. 18.5%, p < 0.025). Delayed recognition of SARS in a hospitalized patient permitted transmission to patients, visitors, and healthcare workers. Older age and number of contacts merit investigation in future studies of superspreading.","O ne of the most intriguing aspects of coronavirusassociated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been the circumstances under which virus is transmitted to large numbers of persons. One so-called superspreading event occurred in a Hong Kong hotel, when transmission from an ill traveler from Guangdong led to export of the virus to several other countries (1) . Another highly effective episode of viral transmission occurred onboard China Air's flight 112 from Hong Kong to Beijing on March 15, 2003 (2) . Superspreading also played major roles in transmission of SARS within Singapore (3) and Toronto (4) . The potential to transmit SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to large numbers of contacts is likely influenced by factors associated with the host, agent, and environment. To develop hypotheses for future international evaluation of this issue, reviewing the circumstances of transmission associated with individual superspreading events may be useful."
Cationic Host Defence Peptides: Potential as Antiviral Therapeutics,There is a pressing need to develop new antiviral,"Abstract There is a pressing need to develop new antiviral treatments; of the 60 drugs currently available, half are aimed at HIV-1 and the remainder target only a further six viruses. This demand has led to the emergence of possible peptide therapies, with 15 currently in clinical trials. Advancements in understanding the antiviral potential of naturally occurring host defence peptides highlights the potential of a whole new class of molecules to be considered as antiviral therapeutics. Cationic host defence peptides, such as defensins and cathelicidins, are important components of innate immunity with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory capabilities. In recent years they have also been shown to be natural, broad-spectrum antivirals against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus. Here we review the antiviral properties of several families of these host peptides and their potential to inform the design of novel therapeutics."
"Evidence of human coroanvirus (229E), in patients with respiratory infec- tion, Iran, 2015: the first report","Background and Objectives: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are one of the main causes of upper respiratory tract infections in humans. While more often responsible for mild illness, they have been associated with illnesses that require hospitalization. Materials and Methods: 270 Samples from patients hospitalized with the respiratory infection during the autumn season of 2015 were evaluated for the presence of four HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HUK1, and NL63) using an optimized SYBR green RT-PCR assay. Results: Fifteen HCoV-229E positive samples were identified (5.5 % positive). 85% of positive samples were male with the range of age between 12-75 years old. Conclusion: It is the first comprehensive study on determination of the role of human coronaviruses in respiratory infections in Iran. Our data provide a novel insight into the epidemiology of HCoVs in Iran. Further studies are needed and should include the isolation and molecular characterization of HCoVs in Iran.","Coronaviruses are globally distributed , although there are differences in the frequency of detection of the four viruses in different parts of the world at different times (1) . Coronaviruses, a genus of the Coro-naviridae family, are enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand RNA genome. The genomic RNA is 27-32 kb in size, capped and polyadenylated. Three serologically distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described. Within each group, viruses are characterized by their host range and genome sequence. Coronaviruses have been identified in mice, rats, chickens, turkeys, swine, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, cattle and humans, and can cause a variety of severe diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract diseases (2) . In humans, coronaviruses are main causes of respiratory tract infections, whereas, in animals, they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity (3) . Hu-man coronaviruses (HCoVs) have attracted renewed interest recently, in part because of the emergence of a novel HCoV associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Before the emergence of CoV-SARS, HCoVs were generally thought to cause mild, self-limited infections of the upper respiratory tract. The study of HCoVs has been hampered by the difficulty in propagating these viruses in vitro (4) . First identified in the mid-1960s, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are recognized to be an important cause of the common cold. Epidemiologic studies have since shown that these viruses are responsible for up to 30% of mild upper respiratory tract infections .More recently, 2 new HCoVs, NL63 and HKU1, have been reported, both detected in respiratory tract specimens from patients with lower respiratory tract illness (5) . The complete viral genome sequence was determined. The characteristic genome organization of coronaviruses can be observed: the 5' two-third of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF1b. In the 3' part of the genome, genes encoding four structural proteins are found: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene, characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses, is not present in HCoV-NL63 (6) . HCoVs are recognized as one of the most frequent causes of URTI or common colds in adults, epidemiological data, and clinical profiles are limited to HCoVs infection in adults with URTI continuously for several years with sensitive molecular methods . There is a need for rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, who are susceptible to serious complications (7) . Few detection methods of coronavirus are available at present. Consequently, these viruses are sought rarely in diagnostic laboratories, and the associated clinical symptoms associated are not defined. Some molecular detection methods were described recently for screening for HCoVs: PCR amplification, simple or nested, with primers defined in the N protein gene (8) . The aim of this study was determinations of role of HCoVs in some respiratory infections in Iranian patients during autumn, 2015 ."
,"Patients want, need and expect that their relatives will be able to visit them during inpatient admissions or accompany them during ambulatory visits. The sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or a similar contagious pathogen, will restrict the number of people entering the hospital. The ethical values that underlie visitor restrictions are discussed here.","The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in April 2003 caused much concern and reaction. Refereed medical journals ever since have been rife with articles about SARS. The eventual containment and treatment of SARS has seen a diminution of the massive media publicity and overt public concern. However, fears have recently surfaced about the potential for re-emergence of SARS in the near future. As we confront the potential need to return to more stringent infection control measures once again, this is an appropriate time to reflect on the ethical values that underlay the strict visitation restrictions imposed in hospitals in Ontario during the SARS outbreak and the moderate restrictions in place since SARS. This reflection will facilitate future decision making with respect to visitation restrictions."
,"Understanding the emergence of new zoonotic agents requires knowledge of pathogen biodiversity in wildlife, human-wildlife interactions, anthropogenic pressures on wildlife populations, and changes in society and human behavior. We discuss an interdisciplinary approach combining virology, wildlife biology, disease ecology, and anthropology that enables better understanding of how deforestation and associated hunting leads to the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens.","A pproximately three fourths of human emerging infectious diseases are caused by zoonotic pathogens (1). These include agents responsible for global mortality (e.g., HIV-1 and -2, influenza virus) and others that cause limited deaths but result in high case-fatality rates and for which no effective therapies or vaccines exist (e.g., Ebola virus, hantaviruses, Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-associated coronavirus) (2) . Despite the growing threat of zoonotic emerging infectious diseases, our understanding of the process of disease emergence remains poor. Public health measures for such diseases often depend on vaccine and drug development to combat diseases once pathogens have emerged. Indeed, many believe that predicting emergence of new zoonoses is an unattainable goal (3) . Despite this, a growing trend in emerging disease research attempts to empirically analyze the process of emergence and move towards predictive capacity for new zoonoses. These studies track broad trends in the emergence of infectious diseases, analyze the risk factors for their emergence, or examine the environmental changes that drive them (4) (5) (6) ."
,Viral infections are common causes,"Viral infections are common causes for upper and lower respiratory tract infections and a frequent reason for outpatient office visits. Comparatively, viral respiratory infections are less common in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting but still play an important clinical role. Most viral respiratory infections in the ICU are community-associated cases with severe lower respiratory disease that can progress into respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1] . The remainder are infections seen in immunocompromised patients, such as transplantation [2, 3] . In some instances (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , influenza, and adenovirus), viral respiratory infections present with fulminant respiratory failure and ARDS, heralding a larger community outbreak [4] . In these situations, the newly recog-nized illness in an ICU patient might be the first presentation of a larger public health emergency."
Cell attachment protein VP8* of a human rotavirus specifically interacts with A-type histo-blood group antigen HHS Public Access,"As with many other viruses, the initial cell attachment of rotaviruses, major causative agent of infantile gastroenteritis, is mediated by interactions with specific cellular glycans 1-4 . The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 5 mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that 'sialidase-sensitive' animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas 'sialidase-insensitive' human rotavirus (HR) strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1 3 . Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies 1,3,6,7 , it is not yet known how VP8* of HRs interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. We found that VP8* of a HR strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-Atype antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in CHO cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of HR.

Cytokine Profiles in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Children Treated With Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy,There have been few longitudinal studies of cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1 infection and none in Asian or Chinese children.,"With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be controlled for prolonged periods, [1] although the virus cannot be eliminated [2] and treatment failures occur due to development of drug-resistant mutations. [3] Chronic immune hyperactivation and raised T-cell turnover due to continued viral replication and antigenic stimulation are present even after HAART has decreased the viral load to undetectable levels. [4] Both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines are produced during chronic immune stimulation. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), contribute to tissue pathology, especially in the brain, [5] and can induce transcription of latent HIV-1.[6,7] Type 2 or regulatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, can suppress type 1 cytokines and induce polyclonal B-cell activation, [8] lymphomagenesis, [9] autoantibody production, [10] and manifestations of allergy. [11] Type 1 cytokines, such as IL-12, interferon (IFN) gamma, and IL-2, are important for antiviral cell-mediated immunity. [12] During the long course of HIV-1 infection, type 2 cytokines gradually come to predominate over type 1 cytokines, [13] [14] [15] [16] although this finding is not universally accepted. [17] There have been few studies of in vitro cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1 infection in Asian or Chinese children. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELIS-POT) system for measuring unstimulated or mitogen-activated cytokine secreting cells has not been evaluated in this context. We wished to know whether monitoring cytokine production in addition to CD4+ cell counts and viral load could provide additional useful information in pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection being treated with HAART. We hoped to identify cytokine profiles that are characteristic of either clinical improvement or disease progression, so that manipulation towards the desirable profile might be attempted."
Structural Analysis of Biomolecules through a Combination of Mobility Capillary Electrophoresis and Mass Spectrometry,"The 3D structures of biomolecules determine their biological function. Established methods in biomolecule structure determination typically require purification, crystallization, or modification of target molecules, which limits their applications for analyzing trace amounts of biomolecules in complex matrices. Here, we developed instruments and methods of mobility capillary electrophoresis (MCE) and its coupling with MS for the 3D structural analysis of biomolecules in the liquid phase. Biomolecules in complex matrices could be separated by MCE and sequentially detected by MS. The effective radius and the aspect ratio of each separated biomolecule were simultaneously determined through the separation by MCE, which were then used as restraints in determining biomolecule conformations through modeling. Feasibility of this method was verified by analyzing a mixture of somatostatin and bradykinin, two peptides with known liquid-phase structures. Proteins could also be structurally analyzed using this method, which was demonstrated for lysozyme. The combination of MCE and MS for complex sample analysis was also demonstrated. MCE and MCE−MS would allow us to analyze trace amounts of biomolecules in complex matrices, which has the potential to be an alternative and powerful biomolecule structure analysis technique.","The activities and functions of a biomolecule in physiological and pathological processes closely correlate to its 3D structure. 1−3 Therefore, biomolecule structure characterization is essential in understanding biological processes and developing targeted drugs. To date, many techniques have been developed and applied in resolving biomolecule structures, including X-ray crystallography, 4−6 NMR, 7−10 cryo-electron microscopy, 11−13 and SAXS. 14, 15 Although relatively high-resolution biomolecule structure information could be obtained through these techniques, their applications in analyzing trace amounts of biomolecules, especially under in situ or in vivo conditions, are limited by the factor that target biomolecules need to be purified to certain homogeneity and in certain amounts. 5 With high sensitivity and specificity, MS is capable of identifying trace amounts of biomolecules in complex matrices. 16−21 Not only the molecular weight information but also the primary sequence could be resolved through highresolution MS and tandem MS, respectively. 22−24 As a result, MS has been widely applied in studying biological systems. It is specifically attractive to use MS-based techniques for the structural and functional investigation of the trace amount of biomolecules in vivo. However, significant challenges exist when using conventional MS for 3D structure studies of biomolecules. To solve this problem, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) 25−30 and capillary electrophoresis (CE) 31−38 have been increasingly coupled with MS to enhance its structure analysis capability. As a gas-phase technique, analytes are vaporized and ionized before their collision cross sections are measured in IMS, 39, 40 thus raising debates whether structures of biomolecules could be fully maintained. 41 Ivory et al. introduced a series of method utilizing counterflows to concentrate analyses in electrophoresis. 42−45 Although CE is a solution-phase technique that separates analytes based on their charge states and sizes, the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in CE is sensitive to its operating conditions, which affects its reproducibility and also its application in biomolecule structural determination. 46, 47 Through chemical modifications of charged groups on a protein surface, the protein ladder method could determine the effective charge and size of a protein by capillary electrophoresis. 48−51 Here, we developed a liquid-phase biomolecule separation and 3D structure analysis technique, named mobility capillary electrophoresis (MCE). MCE is a new type of CE method in which a constant liquid flow was used to replace EOF. Precise control of the liquid flow is beneficial to ion structure analysis. MCE has the capability of not only separating complex samples but also acquiring the sizes of biomolecules. Comparing with the protein ladder method, MCE does not require chemical modifications and has the capability of mixture analyses. The use of MCE in combination with MD simulations as a structural determination method was demonstrated here for peptide mixtures and a protein sample. A home-built MCE system was successfully coupled with a mass spectrometer for complex sample analysis. The MCE−MS system showed high stability, reproducibility, and capabilities for biomolecule separation, identification, and structure determination."
Structural and Functional Bases for Broad-Spectrum Neutralization of Avian and Human Influenza A Viruses,"Influenza virus remains a constant public health threat, owing to its ability to evade immune surveillance through rapid genetic drift and reassortment. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based immunotherapy is a promising strategy for disease control. Here we use a human Ab phage display library and H5 hemagglutinin (HA) ectodomain to select ten neutralizing mAbs (nAbs) with a remarkably broad range among Group 1 influenza viruses, including the H5N1 ""bird flu"" and the H1N1 ""Spanish flu"" strains. Notably, nine of the Abs utilize the same germline gene, VH1-69. The crystal structure of one mAb bound to H5N1 HA reveals that only the heavy chain inserts into a highly conserved pocket in the HA stem, inhibiting the conformational changes",required for membrane fusion. Our studies indicate that nAbs targeting this pocket could provide broad protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza A infections.
"Bartonella spp. in Bats, Kenya","We report the presence and diversity of Bartonella spp. in bats of 13 insectivorous and frugivorous species collected from various locations across Kenya. Bartonella isolates were obtained from 23 Eidolon helvum, 22 Rousettus aegyptiacus, 4 Coleura afra, 7 Triaenops persicus, 1 Hipposideros commersoni, and 49 Miniopterus spp. bats. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene from the obtained isolates showed a wide assortment of Bartonella strains. Phylogenetically, isolates clustered in specifi c host bat species. All isolates from R. aegyptiacus, C. afra, and T. persicus bats clustered in separate monophyletic groups. In contrast, E. helvum and Miniopterus spp. bats harbored strains that clustered in several groups. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these agents are responsible for human illnesses in the region.","A n unprecedented, increasing interest in bats as reservoirs of infectious diseases occurred during the past decade. Mounting evidence indicates an association of bats with various emerging infections, some with high mortality rates, including lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome and other coronaviruses, and henipa, Ebola, and Marburg viruses (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . However, the list of pathogens discovered in bats is even more extensive and includes other representatives from various taxonomic groups (6) (7) (8) . Most infectious agents in bats are viruses; bacterial species have been rarely reported (9) . Excluding reports resulting from serologic and microscopic observations before the 1990s, only a few recent publications describe bacterial species in bats. One publication reports fatal borreliosis in a bat caused by a relapsing fever spirochete in the United Kingdom (10) . Another study on the molecular detection of hemoparasites infecting bats in southwest England showed the presence of Bartonella spp. DNA in the blood of 5 of 60 tested bats (11) . This report on bat infection potentially caused by bacteria of the genus Bartonella is consistent with studies showing detection of Bartonella spp.-specifi c DNA in ectoparasites collected from bats in Egypt and the United States (12) (13) (14) ."
Dynamic and Cell-Infiltratable Hydrogels as Injectable Carrier of Therapeutic Cells and Drugs for Treating Challenging Bone Defects,"Biopolymeric hydrogels have been widely used as carriers of therapeutic cells and drugs for biomedical applications. However, most conventional hydrogels cannot be injected after gelation and do not support the infiltration of cells because of the static nature of their network structure. Here, we develop unique cell-infiltratable and injectable (Ci-I) gelatin hydrogels, which are physically cross-linked by weak and highly dynamic host−guest complexations and are further reinforced by limited chemical cross-linking for enhanced stability, and then demonstrate the outstanding properties of these Ci-I gelatin hydrogels. The highly dynamic network of Ci-I hydrogels allows injection of prefabricated hydrogels with encapsulated cells and drugs, thereby simplifying administration during surgery. Furthermore, the reversible nature of the weak host−guest cross-links enables infiltration and migration of external cells into Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, thereby promoting the participation of endogenous cells in the healing process. Our findings show that Ci-I hydrogels can mediate sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecular drugs (e.g., icaritin) to boost differentiation of stem cells while avoiding the adverse effects (e.g., in treatment of bone necrosis) associated with high drug dosage. The injection of Ci-I hydrogels encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and drug (icaritin) efficiently prevented the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and promoted in situ bone regeneration in an animal model of steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) of the hip by creating the microenvironment favoring the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, including the recruited endogenous cells. We believe that this is the first demonstration on applying injectable hydrogels as effective carriers of therapeutic cargo for treating dysfunctions in deep and enclosed anatomical sites via a minimally invasive procedure.","Various natural and synthetic materials have been used as potential carrier biomaterials of cell or therapeutic agents for tissue regeneration. 1−6 Hydrogels with highly hydrated polymeric networks are ideal carriers for encapsulating cells and drugs. 7−12 However, most conventional hydrogels that allow cells encapsulation are based on static chemical crosslinking and lack dynamic properties such as self-healing and injectability. 13−15 These limitations preclude the delivery of cargo agents by the hydrogel carriers to anatomically deep and enclosed defects via minimally invasive procedures, which have become increasingly popular because of demands for aesthetic appearance and expeditious postsurgery recovery. 16 Furthermore, the rigid and nondegradable nature of chemically crosslinked hydrogels hinders the recruitment and infiltration of host cells into implanted hydrogels, thereby limiting the extent of in situ regeneration and integration of implanted biomaterials into host tissues. 17, 18 Many previous studies have demonstrated the fabrication of dynamic hydrogels stabilized by reversible physical cross-linking including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, ligand−ion coordination, dipole−dipole interactions, and host−guest complexations. 19−37 These physically cross-linked hydrogels exhibit many desirable properties including self-healing and injectability. 38−44 However, because of the weak nature of physical cross-linking and the stringent demands of cell-friendly preparation, few studies have reported physical hydrogels that are sufficiently cytocompatible and stable to allow for encapsulation and long-term culture of cells and to provide continued support to the encapsulated cells in vivo after delivery."

"Structural Basis of Evasion of Cellular Adaptive Immunity by HIV-1 Nef HHS Public Access Author manuscript Online Methods Cloning, E. coli Expression, and Purification","The HIV-1 protein Nef inhibits antigen presentation by class I MHC (MHC-I). Here the mechanism of this activity is revealed by the crystal structure of a protein complex consisting of Nef, the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (MHC-I CD), and the μ1 subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1. A ternary, cooperative interaction clamps the MHC-I CD into a narrow binding groove at the Nef-μ1 interface encompassing the cargo-recognition site of μ1 and the proline rich strand of Nef. The Nef C-terminus induces a novel conformational change in μ1, while the Nterminus binds the Nef core to position it optimally for complex formation. Positively charged patches on μ1 recognize acidic clusters in Nef and MHC-I. The structure shows how Nef functions as a clathrin-associated sorting protein to alter the specificity of host membrane trafficking and enable viral evasion of adaptive immunity.","vesicles for intracellular transport 11, 12 . AP1 transports transmembrane proteins between endosomes and the TGN. Nef co-opts this pathway to retain MHC-I in the TGN before diverting it to lysosomes for degradation 7, 13 . The sequences recognized by AP complexes include the tyrosine-based Yxxϕ motif (ϕ refers to a bulky hydrophobic residue and x to any amino acid) and the leucine-based [ED]xxxL [LI] motif. Yxxϕ sequences bind to the medium-sized (μ) subunit of AP complexes at a well-defined binding pocket 14 . A tyrosine residue in MHC-I CD and the tyrosine-binding pocket in the μ1 subunit are critical for the modulation of MHC-I by Nef [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, the context of this tyrosine-Y 320 SQA-lacks the hydrophobic residue at the Y+3 position, rendering the sequence intrinsically inactive as an AP-binding signal. Nef plays the crucial role of enabling AP1 to recognize and bind the MHC-I CD."
,"The use of PIU during the SARS crisis had a number of positive effects in Taiwan. It enabled the safe transport of SARS patients between hospitals by air and road and decreased the risk of cross-infecting transport personnel. The anxiety of transport personnel was decreased, as was the fear felt by the population of the outer islands. In addition, the credibility of the local health authorities was improved among the general population in Taiwan.","Precautions for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS Evidence suggests that persons infected with SARS recovered physically, but SARS is associated with social and psychological problems poorly understood by the scientific community.

Approximately 20% of the rehabilitated patients showed some negative psychological effects (3), which included insomnia and depression. Some patients with serious cases could not rid themselves of the memories of fighting SARS, and these memories disrupted their daily activities. These psychosocial problems may be due to the complications of SARS medications, such as ribavirin and corticosteroid. Persons who took these drugs had hair loss, major memory loss, impaired concentration, and depression.

Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary biliary cirrhosis (,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) [1] is an immune-mediated chronic progressive inflammatory liver disease that leads to the destruction of small interlobular bile ducts, progressive cholestasis, and, eventually, fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver without medical treatment commonly necessitating liver transplantation. Addison and Gull [2] have first described a disease with a PBC-like picture in 1851, but the term ""primary biliary cirrhosis"" was coined in 1949 when a cohort of 18 patients with characteristic features of PBC was published [3] . PBC, predominantly affecting middle-aged women, is characterized by biochemical markers of cholestasis, serum antimitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA), and lymphocytic infiltration of the portal tracts of the liver [4] . Histologically, the hallmark of the disease is damage to biliary epithelial cells (BEC) and loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts accompanied by significant portal tract infiltration with CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and natural killer cells [5, 6] ."
,"Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is highly infectious in clinical settings, SARS has not been well examined in household settings. The household and household member attack rates were calculated for 1,214 SARS case-patients and their household members, stratified by two phases of the epidemic. A case-control analysis identified risk factors for secondary infection. Secondary infection occurred in 14.9% (22.1% versus 11% in earlier and later phases) of all households and 8% (11.7% versus 5.9% in the earlier and later phases) of all household members. Healthcare workers' households were less likely to be affected. Risk factors from the multivariate analysis included at-home duration before hospitalization, hospital visitation to the SARS patient (and mask use during the visit), and frequency of close contact. SARS transmission at the household level was not negligible in Hong Kong. Transmission rates may be greatly reduced with precautionary measures taken by household members of SARS patients.","T he first large-scale severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong on approximately March 11, 2003 (1,2).

A Method to Identify p62's UBA Domain Interacting Proteins,"The UBA domain is a conserved sequence motif among polyubiquitin binding proteins. For the first time, we demonstrate a systematic, high throughput approach to identification of UBA domain-interacting proteins from a proteome-wide perspective. Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system, we have successfully identified eleven proteins that interact with p62's UBA domain, and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, p62 may play a novel regulatory role through its UBA domain. Our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of UBA domain interacting proteins and its application will unfold the important roles that the UBA domain plays.","p62 is a novel cellular protein which was initially identified in humans as a phosphotyrosine independent ligand of the src homology 2 (SH2) domain of p56 lck (1, 2) . p56 lck is a member of the c-src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that is found predominantly in cells of lymphoid origin (3, 4) . In addition to the interaction with p56 lck , p62 also associates with the Ser/Thr kinase (1, 2) , atypical protein kinase C (5, 6) , and ubiquitin (7) . In addition to the SH2 domain, p62 possesses several structural motifs, including a ubiquitin associated (UBA) domain that is capable of binding ubiquitin nonconvalently (8, 9) . Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids that can be convalently attached to other proteins at specific lysine residues through chains composed of one (mono) or several ubiquitin moieties (poly). In addition to its classical role in protein degradation, ubiquitin is emerging as a signal for protein transport and processing (10) (11) (12) . Conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires three enzymes: a ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and a ubiquitin ligase E3. Initially, E1 activates ubiquitin by forming a high energy thioester intermediate with the C-terminal glycine using ATP. The activated ubiquitin is sequentially transferred to E2, then to E3 which catalyzes isopeptide bond formation between the activated C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and ε-amino group of a lysine residue of the substrate. Following the linkage of the first ubiquitin chain, additional molecules of ubiquitin are attached to lysine side chains of the previously conjugated moiety to form branched polyubiquitin chains. The fate of ubiquitinated substrates depends on the number of ubiquitin moieties conjugated, as well as, the lysine linkage of Ub-Ub conjugation. The conjugation of ubiquitin to eukaryotic intracellular proteins is one way in which those proteins are targeted to the proteasome for subsequent rapid degradation. This mechanism is particularly important for short-lived regulatory proteins such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase-inhibitors, p53, the nuclear factor kappa B precursor, and IκB (13) . The ubiquitinproteasome system consists of two steps: 1) the target protein is conjugated with polyubiquitin molecules, which mark the substrate for degradation; 2) the target protein is transferred to the 26S proteasome, unfolded and degraded."
"Human Bocavirus Infection among Children, Jordan","Human bocavirus was detected in 57 (18.3%) of 312 children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) who required hospitalization in Jordan. It was also detected in 30 (21.7%) of 138 children with severe ARI, in 27 (15.5%) of 174 with mild or moderate disease, and in 41 (72%) of 57 with other pathogens.","A cute respiratory infection (ARI) is a major cause of illness and death worldwide (1) . Although ARI is the third most common cause of death overall, in children it is the major cause of death outside the neonatal period; an estimated 2 million deaths occur in children <5 years of age, predominantly in developing countries (2) . Viruses are a cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and several of them have been described. Among these, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is most important, both in terms of prevalence and effect (3) . However, in recent years, several new viruses have emerged. These include human metapneumovirus (4), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (5) and human coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63 (6, 7) ."
Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome,"Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (ϩ) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (Ϫ) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from ϩRNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas ϪRNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of ϩRNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy. IMPORTANCE The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.","required for polymerase activity (21) (22) (23) . RdRps belong to the expansive class of polymerases containing so-called Palm catalytic domains along with the accessory Fingers and Thumb domains (24, 25) . In addition to viral RdRps, Palm domain polymerases include reverse transcriptases (RTs) of retroelements and reverse-transcribing viruses and the DNA polymerases that are responsible for genome replication in cellular organisms and diverse DNA viruses. Within the Palm domain class of proteins, RT and the ϩRNA virus RdRps are significantly similar in sequence and structure and appear to comprise a monophyletic group (22, (24) (25) (26) . More specifically, the highest similarity is observed between the ϩRNA virus RdRps and the RTs of group II introns. These introns are widespread retrotransposons in prokaryotes that are thought to be ancestral to the RTs of all other retrotransposons as well as retroviruses and pararetroviruses (recently jointly classified as the order Ortervirales) of eukaryotes (27) (28) (29) (30) ."
Illness in Intensive Care Staff after Brief Exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a threat to healthcare workers. After a brief, unexpected exposure to a patient with SARS, 69 intensive-care staff at risk for SARS were interviewed to evaluate risk factors. SARS developed in seven healthcare workers a median of 5 days (range 3-8) after last exposure. SARS developed in 6 of 31 persons who entered the patient's room, including 3 who were present in the room >4 hours. SARS occurred in three of five persons present during the endotracheal intubation, including one who wore gloves, gown, and N-95 mask. The syndrome also occurred in one person with no apparent direct exposure to the index patient. In most, but not all cases, developing SARS was associated with factors typical of droplet transmission. Providing appropriate quarantine and preventing illness in healthcare providers substantially affects delivery of health care.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a disease that consists of fever and respiratory symptoms that can progress to respiratory failure and death (1) . SARS is most likely to develop in healthcare workers and household or family contacts of infected persons (2) (3) (4) . Unprotected exposure to SARS in hospitals has several potential consequences, which include the following: illness in persons and healthcare workers; transmission of SARS from ill healthcare workers and patients to visitors and household contacts; and reduced ability of the healthcare system to deliver care because of illness in or quarantine of healthcare workers. In addition, the psychological impact of isolation and quarantine can be substantial (5) . As a result, understanding factors associated with SARS transmission after exposure to SARS patients is important and would assist with formulating appropriate quarantine procedures. We describe our experience with a large number of healthcare workers who were exposed to a patient in an intensive-care unit (ICU) with undiagnosed SARS."
Examining Landscape Factors Influencing Relative Distribution of Mosquito Genera and Frequency of Virus Infection,"Mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases, including yellow fever and malaria, yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes.","Looking at the world from above, it is striking how once vast belts of tropical rainforest are being fragmented into ever smaller forest blocks (Myers, 1990; Myers et al., 2000; Fig. 1) . Human encroachment on pristine ecosystems is driven by logging and agricultural conversion, resulting in sharp and rapidly moving gradients between the relatively cool and humid primary forest and the cultured land or villages, which show strong insolation, higher temperature, and lower humidity (Malhi and Wright, 2004) . Simultaneously global warming is further modifying rainfall and temperature levels (Kerr, 2007) . The consequences of these changes on the flora and fauna are frequently discussed (Trenberth, 2004; Vora, 2008; Ellis and Wilcox, 2009 ). In general, alterations to habitats and increasing proximity of humans to wild animals are creating new opportunities for infectious diseases to emerge in humans and wildlife, including vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria, or Lyme disease, and also parasitic or respiratory infections (Daszak et al., 2000; Allan et al., 2003; Patz et al., 2005; Nunn and Altizer, 2006; Reiter and LaPointe, 2007; Gillespie and Chapman, 2008; Köndgen et al., 2008) ."
The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in mainland China dissected,"This paper provides a review of a recently published series of studies that give a detailed and comprehensive documentation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in mainland China, which severely struck the country in the spring of 2003. The epidemic spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas. Reanalysis of all available epidemiological data resulted in a total of 5327 probable cases of SARS, of whom 343 died. The resulting case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries or areas, and this difference could only partly be explained by younger age of patients and higher number of community acquired infections. Analysis of the impact of interventions demonstrated that strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response was the most important factor to control SARS in mainland China, whereas the most stringent control measures were all initiated when the epidemic was already dying down. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited, much consumption was merely postponed, but for Beijing irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector were considerable. An important finding from a cohort study was that many former SARS patients currently suffer from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of the treatment with corticosteroids during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable information and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.","In the spring of 2003, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) brought China virtually to a standstill, forcing the country to thoroughly review the infectious disease control policy. Since then, the Chinese government has implemented new and innovative strategies, such as a real-time monitoring system that is now serving as a model for worldwide surveillance and response to infectious disease threats. 1 In order to understand the circumstances at the time, it was necessary to analyse the SARS epidemic in mainland China by dissecting it meticulously, performing a proper autopsy as it where. This was the focus of a multidisciplinary Chinese-European research collaboration of which the results were recently published in a special issue of Tropical Medicine & International Health. 2 The world has moved on since the SARS epidemic, but the insights gained in mainland China remain valuable, with comparable infectious disease threats presenting continuously, such as avian influenza (H5N1) and novel influenza A (H1N1). In the current paper we provide a narrative review of the main findings of our series of papers and discuss these in the context of the broader literature."
Human Bocavirus in French Children,"Human bocavirus (HBoV), a new member of the genus Bocavirus in the family Parvoviridae, has been recently associated with respiratory tract infections. We report the epidemiologic and clinical features observed from a 1-year retrospective study of HBoV infection in young children hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection.","V iral respiratory tract infections cause a substantial amount of illness and death in children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and the more recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV) all cause respiratory tract infections. However, in a substantial proportion of respiratory tract infections, no etiologic agent is detected (1) , which suggests unknown pathogens. A previously unknown virus likely involved in children's respiratory tract infections has been recently described in Sweden (2) and was also identified in Australia (3) and Japan (4) . This newly identified virus shares a high sequence identity and a similar genomic organization with bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus, 2 related members of the Bocavirus genus in the Parvovirinae subfamily of the Parvoviridae family, and it was provisionally named human bocavirus (HBoV)."
Gene-Specific Countermeasures against Ebola Virus Based on Antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers,"The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV) quickly outpace host immune responses and cause hemorrhagic fever, resulting in case fatality rates as high as 90% in humans and nearly 100% in nonhuman primates. The development of an effective therapeutic for EBOV is a daunting public health challenge and is hampered by a paucity of knowledge regarding filovirus pathogenesis. This report describes a successful strategy for interfering with EBOV infection using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). A combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting sequences of viral mRNAs for the viral proteins (VPs) VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents in both pre-and post-exposure therapeutic regimens. In a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial, the PMOs also protected 75% of rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. The work described here may contribute to development of designer, ''druggable'' countermeasures for filoviruses and other microbial pathogens.

PLoS Pathog 2(1): e1.","The development of effective countermeasures to the filoviruses Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) has been a long-sought and difficult endeavor, yielding little success [1, 2] . Although the worst outbreaks have resulted in only several hundred deaths worldwide [3] [4] [5] [6] , the filoviruses are considered a significant global health threat, because as the reservoir remains unknown, the pathogen is extremely deadly and highly infectious by aerosol, and there is anecdotal evidence that the use of both MARV and EBOV were explored as potential biowarfare agents in the offensive program of the former Soviet Union [7] [8] [9] [10] . The filoviruses are relatively simple viruses of 19-Kb genomes and consist of seven genes which encode nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein, four smaller viral proteins (VPs) (VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), all in a single strand of negative-sensed RNA [11] ."
Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) Infection Alters the Expression of Cellular MicroRNA Species That Affect Transcription of TGEV Gene 7,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of Coronaviridae family. TGEV infection has emerged as a major cause of severe gastroenteritis and leads to alterations of many cellular processes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV is still unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small non-coding RNAs which are involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes such as viral infection and cell apoptosis. Accumulating data show that miRNAs are involved in the process of coronavirus infection such as replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, the link between miRNAs and TGEV infection is unknown. In this study, we performed microRNA microarray assay and predicted targets of altered miRNAs. The results showed TGEV infection caused the change of miRNAs profile. Then we selected miR-4331 for further analysis and subsequently identified cell division cycle-associated protein 7 (CDCA7) as the target of miR-4331. Moreover, miR-4331 showed the ability to inhibit transcription of TGEV gene 7 (a non-structure gene) via directly targeting CDCA7. In conclusion, differentially expressed miR-4331 that is caused by TGEV infection can suppress transcription of TGEV gene 7 via targeting cellular CDCA7. Our key finding is that TGEV selectively manipulates the expression of some cellular miRNAs to regulate its subgenomic transcription.","The miRNAs are small RNA species (containing about 22 nucleotides) which are found in animals, plants, and some viruses. It has been shown that miRNAs play a variety of roles in many cellular processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle (reviewed in reference [1] ). Generally, miRNAs are derived from introns or intergenes of eukaryotic organisms or viruses and serve as regulators of gene expression [2] . The miRNA-mediated RNA interference includes two patterns. One is perfectly base-paring with 3' UTR of target mRNA leading to degradation of mRNA. The other is imperfectly binding to target 3' UTR of mRNA resulting in the inhibition of mRNA translation. In mammalians, miRNAs perform RNAi through translation inhibition mediated through imperfect complementarity [3] . As a result, a miRNA can directly interact with multiple targets and a gene can be targeted by many miRNAs [4] ."
Pathogenic characteristics of persistent feline enteric coronavirus infection in cats,"Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) comprise two biotypes: feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV). FECV is associated with asymptomatic persistent enteric infections, while FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a usually fatal systemic disease in domestic cats and some wild Felidae. FIPV arises from FECV by mutation. FCoV also occur in two serotypes, I and II, of which the serotype I viruses are by far the most prevalent in the field. Yet, most of our knowledge about FCoV infections relates to serotype II viruses, particularly about the FIPV, mainly because type I viruses grow poorly in cell culture. Hence, the aim of the present work was the detailed study of the epidemiologically most relevant viruses, the avirulent serotype I viruses. Kittens were inoculated oronasally with different doses of two independent FECV field strains, UCD and RM. Persistent infection could be reproducibly established. The patterns of clinical symptoms, faecal virus shedding and seroconversion were monitored for up to 10 weeks revealing subtle but reproducible differences between the two viruses. Faecal virus, i.e. genomic RNA, was detected during persistent FECV infection only in the large intestine, downstream of the appendix, and could occasionally be observed also in the blood. The implications of our results, particularly our insights into the persistently infected state, are discussed.","Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) present themselves in different forms. First of all there are two biotypes, the low-or avirulent viruses and the highly virulent ones. The former viruses cause intestinal infection with no or only mild clinical manifestations, i.e. diarrhoea in young kittens. These so-called feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV) are the predominant pathotype in the field. FECV infection often persists in apparently healthy animals, which shed the virus in their faeces. Natural infection occurs via the faecal-oral route. FECV infection appears to be mainly restricted to the intestinal tract where the virus replicates in villous epithelial cells. The virulent pathotype, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), causes severe systemic infection with lesions in many organs and tissues, most typically in the peritoneum, hence the disease's name feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Unlike FECV, FIPV does not spread readily among cats. Instead, it originates de novo by spontaneous mutation from FECV in individual animals [4, 24, 26, 30] often under conditions of immune suppression due to medication or coinfection [26] . FIP is a highly fatal disease that occurs in domestic cats and some wild felidae usually between 3 and 16 months of age. The disease is currently the leading infectious cause of death in domestic cats. In catteries 80 to 90% of the animals are usually feline coronavirus seropositive, in single cat households seropositivity often varies between 10 and 50% [20] . From the seropositive cats, 5 to 12% eventually develop FIP [1] . There is at present no effective way to prevent the infection or treat the disease. For recent reviews on FCoV, see Haijema et al. [11] and Pedersen [25] ."
and the NCID/SARS Community Outreach Team 1 EMERGENCE OF SARS,"Because of their evolving nature and inherent scientific uncertainties, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases can be associated with considerable fear in the general public or in specific communities, especially when illness and deaths are substantial. Mitigating fear and discrimination directed toward persons infected with, and affected by, infectious disease can be important in controlling transmission. Persons who are feared and stigmatized may delay seeking care and remain in the community undetected. This article outlines efforts to rapidly assess, monitor, and address fears associated with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the United States. Although fear, stigmatization, and discrimination were not widespread in the general public, Asian-American communities were particularly affected.","P ublic health strategies that deal with rapidly evolving disease outbreaks of new and emerging infectious diseases require a delicate balance between protecting the public's health and initiating exclusionary practices and treatments that can lead to fear and stigmatization of, and discrimination against, specific populations. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) illustrates these difficulties. SARS spontaneously appeared in the southern province of Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in November 2002 (1, 2) . By July 2003, the epidemic, had spread to more than 30 countries with 8,427 cumulative probable cases and 916 deaths and was identified as a global threat to health (1) . In the United States, 418 cases were reported with 74 classified as probable SARS; no deaths occurred (1) . As with many disease outbreaks, scientific information and data related to the disease changed almost hourly, as public health scientists and practitioners responded to the worldwide outbreak, which was coupled with widespread fear (3, 4) ."
,"Surveillance and outbreak reporting systems in Vietnam required improvements to function effectively as early warning and response systems. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a pilot project in 2016 focusing on community and hospital event-based surveillance. The pilot was implemented in 4 of Vietnam's 63 provinces. The pilot demonstrated that event-based surveillance resulted in early detection and reporting of outbreaks, improved collaboration between the healthcare facilities and preventive sectors of the ministry, and increased community participation in surveillance and reporting.","Regional Institutes in each of Vietnam's 4 administrative health regions are responsible for implementing and overseeing surveillance and response. Within each region, Provincial Preventive Medicine Centers (PPMCs) lead these activities within their jurisdictions, involving the Regional Institutes for larger events. The PPMCs are supported by 2 lower administrative levels, the District Health Center (DHC) and Commune Health Station (CHS). The CHS is generally staffed by a medical professional and village health workers (VHWs), who are largely volunteers. The VHWs promote prenatal visits and vaccinations and in theory are responsible for reporting outbreaks from their communities. In addition, several community members called health collaborators assist VHWs in these tasks."
"Technical Appendix Supplementary material including additional methodology, results, and discussion. Additional Methods","Under the treatment only strategy, we considered the possibility that the treatment stockpiles may be limited. We analyzed the effect of varying the percentage of infected receiving treatment, on the outcome of peak absenteeism; for different R 0 . Under the prophylaxis strategies, we assumed that treatment stockpiles would be large enough to ensure sufficient treatment doses are available above those planned for use as prophylaxis.","We also explored the scenario that although the prophylaxis stockpiles are fixed at a certain quantity, a proportion of HCWs may develop clinical illness either before the start of, or during, prophylaxis. If these clinically infected HCWs can be identified as pandemic influenza infections, they would not need to continue receiving prophylaxis. The result is that some prophylaxis doses may be saved; and these saved doses may potentially be redistributed to the other non-clinically infected HCWs, prolonging prophylaxis beyond the planned duration. For example, if we originally stockpiled for 6 weeks of prophylaxis, and some HCWs could stop prophylaxis because they were clinically infected prior to the start of or during prophylaxis, then some doses could be saved and redistributed to other HCWs. This prolongs the duration of prophylaxis beyond the original 6 weeks. We have performed analyses to explore this scenario, although this is only possible if tests can promptly confirm individual infection and logistics networks allow for prompt redistribution. To address this issue from another angle, we explored the number of prophylaxis doses used at the end of the planned duration of prophylaxis for the various scenarios (based on R 0 ) if those who are clinically infected can be identified and prophylaxis stopped."
"Secondary Household Transmission of SARS, Singapore EMERGENCE OF SARS",Secondary household transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was studied in 114 households involving 417 contacts. The attack rate was low (6.2%). Occupation of the index case was the factor that most influenced household transmission (adjusted hazard ratio for healthcare workers 0.157; 95% confidence interval 0.042 to 0.588).,"S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1) . Attack rates are >50% in hospitals (2) . A similar trend was seen in Singapore, with SARS spreading to five hospitals and two Specialty Centres within 8 weeks (3) . This rapid rate of transmission caused a national health alert and resulted in large amounts of manpower and resources being deployed."

Although Amblyomma americanum, the main known vector of E. chaffeensis, has not been reported in Venezuela, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and A. cajennense are abundant in rural areas of Venezuela; their ability to be vectors should be investigated.","To the Editor: Planning for pandemic infl uenza is accepted as an essential healthcare service and has included creation of national and international antiviral drug stockpiles and novel approaches to emergency vaccine development (1) . The effectiveness of these strategies in a pandemic may be substantial but is unknown. More certain is that effective management of severe and complicated infl uenza will reduce deaths and that demand will exceed available treatment resources (2) . Appropriate allocation of treatment resources is therefore essential, perhaps more important than any specifi c treatment such as administering antiviral medication to symptomatic patients. Re- (4) . Even more important for most severely ill patients, however, will be deciding whether to admit them to the hospital at all. The UK pandemic-planning criteria currently recommend a scoring system for hospital admission based on an assessment of poor outcome rather than on capacity to benefi t (2). Indeed, age >85 years and severe underlying cognitive impairment, which would rule out admission to critical care in Canada, would strongly favor admission to hospital care in the United Kingdom, the opposite of the situation for a younger cognitively intact person with similar disease severity. If tools are to be developed to support triage at all stages of the patient pathway in a pandemic, societies must consider the ethical issues raised (4,5), debate them, and take a position on the values that should underpin decision making in a pandemic. Even when clear societal goals are established, much work remains to ensure that the healthcare community is equipped to steer healthcare resources to deliver these effectively (6) . Community-acquired pneumonia has been used as a surrogate for infl uenza to test predictive scoring systems for assessing severity and assisting triage decisions (7) . Seasonal infl uenza epidemics would provide the most realistic setting available, in particular, if protocols were in place to test criteria when a relatively severe infl uenza season occurs. In addition to identifying criteria for setting priorities within infl uenza management, such testing will need to consider the balance of resources between infl uenza treatment and treatment of other usual noninfl uenza conditions that will require emergency care during the pandemic. Decisions that must be made during a pandemic are complex, varying from when to stop major elective surgery so critical care capacity can be opened up, to how to triage those who have experienced major trauma and those with infl uenza. These decisions could differ from those same decisions made outside a pandemic, and an adequate evidence base is needed if they are to be of good quality."
"SARS-associated Coronavirus Transmission, United States","To better assess the risk for transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we obtained serial specimens and clinical and exposure data from seven confirmed U.S. SARS patients and their 10 household contacts. SARS-CoV was detected in a day-14 sputum specimen from one casepatient and in five stool specimens from two case-patients. In one case-patient, SARS-CoV persisted in stool for at least 26 days after symptom onset. The highest amounts of virus were in the day-14 sputum sample and a day-14 stool sample. Residual respiratory symptoms were still present in recovered SARS case-patients 2 months after illness onset. Possible transmission of SARS-CoV occurred in one household contact, but this person had also traveled to a SARS-affected area. The data suggest that SARS-CoV is not always transmitted efficiently. Routine collection and testing of stool and sputum specimens of probable SARS case-patients may help the early detection of SARS-CoV infection.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recently described as the clinical manifestation of infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV), the SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . This syndrome was first recognized in February 2003 in Vietnam, but it was later realized that the first cases occurred in southern China in November 2002 (6, 7) . Subsequently, the infection rapidly spread throughout the world, and by July 2003, when the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak was contained, 8,437 cases and 813 deaths in 32 countries had been reported (8) ."
Human Metapneumovirus Detection in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"We used a combination approach of conventional virus isolation and molecular techniques to detect human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Of the 48 study patients, 25 (52.1%) were infected with HMPV; 6 of these 25 patients were also infected with coronavirus, and another 5 patients (10.4%) were infected with coronavirus alone. Using this combination approach, we found that human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells were superior to rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2) cells commonly used in previous studies for isolation of HMPV. These widely available HEp-2 cells should be included in conjunction with a molecular method for cell culture followup to detect HMPV, particularly in patients with SARS.","H uman metapneumovirus (HMPV) was first identified in 2001 in samples from children with respiratory tract diseases (1) . Subsequent studies showed that the virus is responsible worldwide for a proportion of communityacquired acute respiratory tract infections in children (2) (3) (4) , as well as other age groups (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Co-infection of HMPV with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants has been suggested to be a factor that influences the severity of bronchiolitis (10) ."
Influenza-associated Deaths in Tropical Singapore Influenza-associated Deaths in Tropical Singapore,"We used a regression model to examine the impact of influenza on death rates in tropical Singapore for the period 1996-2003. Influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant circulating influenza virus subtype, with consistently significant and robust effect on mortality rates. Influenza was associated with an annual death rate from all causes, from underlying pneumonia and influenza, and from underlying circulatory and respiratory conditions of 14.8 (95% confidence interval 9.8-19.8), 2.9 (1.0-5.0), and 11.9 (8.3-15.7) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. These results are comparable with observations in the United States and subtropical Hong Kong. An estimated 6.5% of underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths were attributable to influenza. The proportion of influenza-associated deaths was 11.3 times higher in persons age >65 years than in the general population. Our findings support the need for influenza surveillance and annual influenza vaccination for at-risk populations in tropical countries.","I nfluenza virus infections cause excess illness and deaths in temperate countries. In the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza epidemics occur nearly every winter, leading to an increase in hospitalizations and deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that these annual epidemics result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000-500,000 deaths each year around the world (1). In the United States, influenza is responsible for 50 million illnesses and up to 47,200 deaths annually (2) (3) (4) ."
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids inhibit nuclear-to-cytoplasmic export of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1,"Background Few drugs are currently licensed to treat influenza A infection, and new therapies are needed, especially for highly pathogenic strains.

Methods Antiviral activities of the compounds were tested in time-of-addition assays, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, neuraminidase (NA) activity assays, and viral entry inhibition assays using H5N1-HIV pseudoviruses. Effects of the compounds on localization and activity of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) were determined by immunofluorescence and an RNP minigenome assay, respectively."

Celiac and non-celiac gluten sensitivity: a review on the association with schizophrenia and mood disorders,"An association between many psychiatric and gluten-related disorders has been known for some time. In the case of schizophrenia and mood disorders, the major psychiatric disorders, there is much evidence, not without contradictions, of a possible association between schizophrenia and celiac disease. The association between mood disorders and gluten-related disorders, especially celiac disease, has only been studied for depression, often coupled with anxiety, and very recently for bipolar disorder. Since non-celiac gluten sensitivity is now known to be different from celiac disease, many studies have shown that gluten sensitivity is also associated with major psychiatric disorders. Here we review the literature on the association between schizophrenia/mood disorders and celiac disease/ gluten sensitivity, pointing out the differences between these associations.","An increased rate of autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated in individuals with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) [1, 2] and mood disorders (MD) [3, 4] . Individuals diagnosed as having an autoimmune disease are also likely to be at increased risk of psychiatric disorders. Thus, the involvement of autoimmune mechanisms is increasingly held responsible for the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Among autoimmune diseases, celiac disease (CD) has been described for years in association with SCZ [5] [6] [7] , as celiac patients are felt to be at increased risk of schizophrenia. However, it has recently been discovered that the immune response to gluten in schizophrenic patients diverges from that in CD [8, 9] . As far as mood disorders are concerned, since they have not been systematically studied as disorders, their association with CD is neither conclusive nor systematic and is limited to depression, often coupled with anxiety. Moreover, when a positive statistical association between depression and celiac disease has been found, the percentage frequencies varied from 6 to 57 % [10] . There is still a lack of consensus about the nature of this association, with two opposing schools of thought: the first posits that specific mechanisms are implied in a common pathogenesis, while the second considers depression not specifically linked to CD but rather a chance event [11] . Regarding bipolar disorder (BD), to date only a few studies have investigated its association with CD. The first report showed increased risk of developing depression but not bipolar disorder in patients diagnosed with CD, while prior depression and BD were positively associated with subsequent onset of CD [12] . In a recent study, celiac disease was not demonstrated to determine a statistically significant risk of bipolar disorder [4] . However, like for schizophrenia, recent research showed that immunological reactivity to gluten, different from CD, can also be present in bipolar disorder [13] [14] [15] . This reactivity towards gluten is known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or more simply gluten sensitivity (GS), recently found to be different from CD [16] ."
Differential innate immune response programs in neuronal subtypes determine susceptibility to infection in the brain by positive stranded RNA viruses HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"Although susceptibility of neurons in the brain to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome, little is known about the molecular factors governing this. Here, we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions exhibited differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons (GCN) of the cerebellum and cortical neurons (CN) from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing CN with genes that were expressed more highly in GCN, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1, and Rsad2/Viperin) that mediated antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in GCN. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which likely contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection.","Virus infection of mammalian cells induces signaling pathways that promote an antiviral state. RNA intermediates of virus replication are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), which signal specific transcription factors to induce innate defense programs, including type I interferon (IFN) expression and secretion. Binding of IFN to IFN-αβ receptor (Ifnar) on infected and uninfected cells results in a signaling cascade that restricts infection of many viruses through expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several studies report that type I IFN receptor-knockout mice (Ifnar −/− ) exhibit enhanced mortality after viral infection due to increased viral burden and expanded tropism in neurons of the brain 1,2 ."

Thus, we can safely conclude that a diverse team can be a creative team since when investigators of different points of view are brought together, they ponder and question the interpretations, procedures and practices of others. Such is the case for the scientific approach (1). Thus, often butting heads, sometimes even locking horns in healthy debate, is most often resolved by the emergence of creativity. I will now propose several ways in which eCAM approaches the question of diversity and I hope that in the process we also engage in this act of creation.","'Diversity' is now a magic word, showing up everywhere and often used to embrace many aspects of human activity, whether in government, the arts, sciences, research, choice of research subjects or so on.

Precautionary Behavior in Response to Perceived Threat of Pandemic Infl uenza,"Faced with an epidemic of an infectious disease, persons may take precautionary actions to try to reduce their risk. Such actions include avoiding situations that persons perceive to be risky, which can have negative health and economic effects. Therefore, we conducted a populationbased survey of persons' precautionary actions in response to a hypothetical infl uenza pandemic. For the 5 European and 3 Asian regions that had been affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome, the pattern of reported precautionary action was broadly similar across the regions; ≈75% of respondents reported that they would avoid public transportation and 20%-30% would try to stay indoors. Some regional differences were noted; Europeans were more likely than Asians to avoid places of entertainment, and Asians were more likely to avoid seeing physicians. This international survey provides insight into what might be expected during an infl uenza pandemic.","Faced with an epidemic of an infectious disease, persons may take precautionary actions to try to reduce their risk.

BMC Microbiology Cloaked similarity between HIV-1 and SARS-CoV suggests an anti-SARS strategy,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a febrile respiratory illness. The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), whose genome was recently sequenced. Since it is a member of the Coronaviridae, its spike protein (S2) is believed to play a central role in viral entry by facilitating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The protein responsible for viralinduced membrane fusion of HIV-1 (gp41) differs in length, and has no sequence homology with S2.","Infection by many enveloped viruses requires fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. A viral envelope protein mediates this membrane fusion process. These proteins are synthesized as precursors (ENV in Retroviridae, and E2 in Coronaviridae) that are later processed into a transmembrane subunit (gp41 in the retrovirus HIV-1, and S2 in the coronavirus SARS-CoV) that is responsible for viralinduced membrane fusion, and a surface subunit that is responsible for the interaction with the cellular receptor/s. HIV-1 gp41, which is a well-characterized protein [1, 2] contains two heptad repeat (HR) regions, a leucine/isoleucine HR adjacent to its N-terminus (N-HR), and C-HR proximal to the transmembrane domain (see Figure 1 ). Heptad repeats are characterized by hydrophobic amino acids in the ""a"" and ""d"" positions of the helix. In the N-HR of gp41, all but one of the ""a"" positions are Leucines or Isoleucines. This feature is less strict in the ""d"" positions of N-HR, and in the ""a"" and ""d"" positions of the C-HR. Peptides corresponding to these heptad repeat regions form the ""trimer-of-hairpins"" core structure of gp41 [3] as confirmed by the solution of the crystal structures [1, 2] . Two Cysteine residues and one Proline residue, located between these two HRs, confine a hairpin conformation (Figure 2a) . A tryptophan-rich motif, located between the C-HR and the transmembrane domain, was shown to play a crucial role in gp41-mediated membrane fusion [4] (Figure 2a) ."
Detection of alpha and betacoronaviruses in multiple Iberian bat species,"Bat coronaviruses (CoV) are putative precursors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and other CoV that crossed the species barrier from zoonotic reservoirs into the human population.

Interferon-α2b and ribavirin treatment improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques HHS Public Access Author manuscript,"The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is of global concern -causing severe respiratory illness with 97 confirmed cases and 46 deaths 1 . Therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo, thus patient management relies exclusively on supportive care, which given the high case-fatality rate is not highly effective. The rhesus macaque is the only known disease model for MERS-CoV, developing an acute localized-towidespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease 2,3 that recapitulates mild-to-moderate human MERS-CoV cases 4,5 . The combination of interferon-α2b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro 6 ; therefore, this strategy was initiated 8 h post-infection in the Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:","rhesus macaque model. Treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed noto-very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed reduced levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers in addition to reduced viral genome copies, altered gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-α2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic, IFN-α2b and ribavirin should be considered for management of MERS-CoV cases."
Organic Carbamates in Drug Design and Medicinal Chemistry,"The carbamate group is a key structural motif in many approved drugs and prodrugs. There is an increasing use of carbamates in medicinal chemistry and many derivatives are specifically designed to make drug−target interactions through their carbamate moiety. In this Perspective, we present properties and stabilities of carbamates, reagents and chemical methodologies for the synthesis of carbamates, and recent applications of carbamates in drug design and medicinal chemistry.","Carbamate-bearing molecules play an important role in modern drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. Organic carbamates (or urethanes) are structural elements of many approved therapeutic agents. Structurally, the carbamate functionality is related to amide-ester hybrid features and, in general, displays very good chemical and proteolytic stabilities. Carbamates are widely utilized as a peptide bond surrogate in medicinal chemistry. This is mainly due to their chemical stability and capability to permeate cell membranes. Another unique feature of carbamates is their ability to modulate inter-and intramolecular interactions with the target enzymes or receptors. The carbamate functionality imposes a degree of conformational restriction due to the delocalization of nonbonded electrons on nitrogen into the carboxyl moiety. In addition, the carbamate functionality participates in hydrogen bonding through the carboxyl group and the backbone NH. Therefore, substitution on the O-and N-termini of a carbamate offers opportunities for modulation of biological properties and improvement in stability and pharmacokinetic properties."
"Lack of SARS Transmission among Healthcare Workers, United States EMERGENCE OF SARS EMERGENCE OF SARS Search past issues of EID at www.cdc.gov/eid","Healthcare workers accounted for a large proportion of persons with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the worldwide epidemic of early 2003. We conducted an investigation of healthcare workers exposed to laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in the United States to evaluate infection-control practices and possible SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmission. We identified 110 healthcare workers with exposure within droplet range (i.e., 3 feet) to six SARS-CoV-positive patients. Forty-five healthcare workers had exposure without any mask use, 72 had exposure without eye protection, and 40 reported direct skin-to-skin contact. Potential droplet-and aerosol-generating procedures were infrequent: 5% of healthcare workers manipulated a patient's airway, and 4% administered aerosolized medication. Despite numerous unprotected exposures, there was no serologic evidence of healthcare-related SARS-CoV transmission. Lack of transmission in the United States may be related to the relative absence of high-risk procedures or patients, factors that may place healthcare workers at higher risk for infection.","T he epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) quickly spread worldwide in 2003. As of July 11, 2003, a total of 29 countries had reported 8,427 probable cases to the World Health Organization (1) . Much of the disease worldwide was associated with hospital-based outbreaks (2, 3) . Healthcare workers made up a large proportion of cases, accounting for 37%-63% of suspected SARS cases in highly affected countries (4) (5) (6) . In the United States, the epidemic was limited; 74 probable and 8 laboratory-confirmed case-patients were reported, despite aggressive efforts at detection, particularly in groups at high risk. Surveillance for symptoms of SARS was recommended for all healthcare workers who were exposed to patients meeting the clinical case definition for suspected or probable SARS (7) ."
Screening Pneumonia Patients for Mimivirus 1,"Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APM), a virus of free-living amebae, has reportedly caused human respiratory disease. Using 2 newly developed real-time PCR assays, we screened 496 respiratory specimens from 9 pneumoniapatient populations for APM. This virus was not detected in any specimen, which suggests it is not a common respiratory pathogen.","I nvestigation of a suspected Legionnaire's pneumonia outbreak in 1992 led to the isolation of a new microorganism from a water cooling tower in Bradford, England. This pathogen was thought to be a bacterium because it resembled small gram-positive cocci; however, in 2003 it was correctly identifi ed as a virus (1) . Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APM), named for its ameba host and bacteria-mimicking characteristics, is a double-stranded DNA virus with the largest viral genome described to date (1.2 Mb) (2) . Mimiviridae is the newest member of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) group, which also contains Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Asfarviridae, and Phycodnaviridae (1) . APM encodes specifi c translation proteins that are more commonly associated with cellular organisms than with viruses (2) ."
Echinacea purpurea (Purple Coneflower) in Infectious Diseases,"Extracts of Echinacea purpurea (EP, purple coneflower) have been used traditionally in North America for the treatment of various types of infections and wounds, and they have become very popular herbal medicines globally. Recent studies have revealed that certain standardized preparations contain potent and selective antiviral and antimicrobial activities. In addition, they display multiple immune-modulatory activities, comprising stimulation of certain immune functions such as phagocytic activity of macrophages and suppression of the proinflammatory responses of epithelial cells to viruses and bacteria, which are manifested as alterations in secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. These immune modulations result from upregulation or downregulation of the relevant genes and their transcription factors. All these bioactivities can be demonstrated at noncytotoxic concentrations of extract and appear to be due to multiple components rather than the individual chemical compounds that characterize Echinacea extracts. Potential applications of the bioactive extracts may go beyond their traditional uses.","Herbal medicines derived from several species of the indigenous Echinacea genus were in use throughout the plains of North America long before the introduction of European medicines, primarily as treatments for various infectious diseases and wounds. Nine discrete species were classified subsequently by botanists, as indicated in Table 1 , although medical records suggest that considerable interchange between uses of designated species occurred and consequently the association of a specific species with particular treatments has to be viewed with caution [1] [2] [3] . Even in recent years there have been revisions in the taxonomy of the genus [4, 5] . Nevertheless it is generally agreed that Echinacea purpurea, the purple coneflower, was widely used by Native peoples and later by the Eclectic practitioners of North America, possibly because it was so widespread, and also because it was apparently effective in a number of diseases. Current herbal preparations, which have become very popular in North America, Europe, and elsewhere, have tended to favor this species over the others, and the majority of the basic scientific studies have focused on this one. Accordingly, this review is restricted primarily to discussion of E. purpurea (abbreviated EP), with occasional reference to alternative species."
Comparing Neural-Network Scoring Functions and the State of the Art: Applications to Common Library Screening,"We compare established docking programs, AutoDock Vina and Schrodinger's Glide, to the recently published NNScore scoring functions. As expected, the best protocol to use in a virtual-screening project is highly dependent on the target receptor being studied. However, the mean screening performance obtained when candidate ligands are docked with Vina and rescored with NNScore 1.0 is not statistically different than the mean performance obtained when docking and scoring with Glide. We further demonstrate that the Vina and NNScore docking scores both correlate with chemical properties like small-molecule size and polarizability. Compensating for these potential biases leads to improvements in virtual screen performance. Composite NNScore-based scoring functions suited to a specific receptor further improve performance. We are hopeful that the current study will prove useful for those interested in computer-aided drug design.","Because of the high cost and time requirements associated with traditional high-throughput screens, many researchers now use computational methods to prefilter candidate ligands prior to experimental testing. A number of ligand-based computational techniques for identifying likely binders have been utilized. These include 2D screening with fingerprints, 1−3 shape-based screening, 4, 5 and pharmacophore matching, 6 which identify potential actives by comparing their atomic connectivities, three-dimensional shapes, and three-dimensional pharmacophores to those of known ligands, respectively."
,"An outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred in the northern area of Jiangsu Province in China from January to July in 2003. A total of 1,681 cases were involved in this outbreak, and 99% of patients were <15 years of age. To identify the etiologic agent, 66 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were tested by cell culture. Eighteen showed an enteroviruslike cytopathic effect on MRC-5 human fetal diploid lung cells. An enterovirus primer-mediated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, a standard neutralization assay, and sequencing of the complete capsidencoding (VP1) gene identified the 18 isolates (FDJS03) as echovirus 30. At least a 10% difference was seen in nucleotide sequences of VP1 between FDJS03 isolates and other global strains of echovirus 30. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete sequences of VP1 was performed to further characterize the FDJS03 isolates. This report is the first to identify a distinct lineage of echovirus 30 as a probable cause of this outbreak.","E nteroviruses circulate worldwide and are the most commonly identified cause of aseptic meningitis, particularly in infants and young children; 30,000-50,000 persons per year are hospitalized with aseptic meningitis in the United States (1) . During the past decade, numerous outbreaks of enteroviral meningitis were documented throughout the world (2) (3) (4) (5) . In China, infections with other enteroviruses are reported more frequently because wildtype polioviruses were eradicated by the expanded immunization program in 1992. Outbreaks associated with nonpolio enteroviruses have been sequentially reported in recent years (6) (7) (8) . Specific serotypes of etiologic agents were not identified in outbreaks involving nonpolio enteroviruses in China, since serotyping usually had no influence on clinical management of a given patient with an enteroviral infection. However, identification of the serotype and the molecular characteristics of the prevailing virus can provide valuable epidemiologic information in outbreak investigations. The serotype-specific immune status of the population, territorial competition among serotypes, and transmission efficiency of the virus may also be important factors influencing epidemiologic behavior of human enteroviruses (HEV) (9, 10) . An understanding of circulating virus strains in local regions would be essential in effectively controlling enteroviral infections."
Function-Based Mutation-Resistant Synthetic Signaling Device Activated by HIV-1 Proteolysis,"The high mutation rate of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virus is a major problem since it evades the function of antibodies and chemical inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate a viral detection strategy based on synthetic biology principles to detect a specific viral function rather than a particular viral protein. The resistance caused by mutations can be circumvented since the mutations that cause the loss of function also incapacitate the virus. Many pathogens encode proteases that are essential for their replication and that have a defined substrate specificity. A genetically encoded sensor composed of a fused membrane anchor, viral protease target site, and an orthogonal transcriptional activator was engineered into a human cell line. The HIV-1 protease released the transcriptional activator from the membrane, thereby inducing transcription of the selected genes. The device was still strongly activated by clinically relevant protease mutants that are resistant to protease inhibitors. In the future, a similar principle could be applied to detect also other pathogens and functions.","V iral diseases represent a significant challenge for medical therapy, and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is one of the most difficult viruses to treat because it hijacks the cells of the immune system. HIV-1 uses the viral glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 to bind to cellular receptors, reverse transcriptase to transcribe its RNA into DNA, integrase to integrate viral genome into the host, and viral protease to cleave viral polyprotein into functional proteins. All of these viral proteins have been and still are investigated as targets for therapeutic inhibitors to interfere with the viral lifecycle. The main reason for the difficulty in developing effective drugs is the lack of proofreading in the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1. As a consequence, mutations occur with high frequency, thereby modifying the sequence of the HIV-1 proteins. Resistance evolves quickly, rendering many of the chemical inhibitors or antibodies useless. The most effective current treatment is based on highly active antiretroviral therapy, which employs a cocktail of several antiretroviral drugs against different targets based on different inhibition mechanisms, thereby decreasing the probability of simultaneous mutational escape. 1 HIV-1 viral proteins are translated as a Gag-Pol-polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease into 11 polypeptide chains. Without this proteolytic cleavage, the virus remains noninfectious. 2 Dimeric aspartic viral protease, which cleaves this polyprotein, is specific to the virus, and proteases from human cells cannot supplement its function. 3 Random mutations of HIV-1 protease that abolish its activityor the pharmacological inhibitiondisrupt HIV's ability to replicate and infect additional cells. 4 HIV-1 protease was one of the first targets of therapy, and protease inhibitors are still being used in treatment. However, mutations that occur within the protease may retain a sufficient fraction of the proteolytic activity that supports viral survival and renders the protease resistant to inhibitors. The rapid mutation rate of the HIV-1 virus results in a large number of variants, even within an individual patient, and the selective pressure of antiviral therapy leads to the proliferation of drug-resistant HIV-1 protease strains. The G48V mutant is considered to be the key signature residue mutation of HIV-1 protease in the development of resistance against saquinavir (SAQ) therapy. 5 G48V usually co-occurs with the resistance mutations I54T and V82A. 6 Mutations at position 54 contribute to the resistance of the virus against all of the approved protease inhibitors, 7 and the V82A mutant is one of the first drug-resistant mutations to occur in HIV-1 protease in patients receiving antiviral therapy. 8, 9 In this study, we have considered the possibility of employing synthetic biology principles to engineer a cellular device that can detect the HIV-1 infection and trigger production of reporter or antiviral proteins. We reasoned that an effective biological antiviral device should be based on essential viral function rather than on a specific protein with a defined sequence or tertiary structure that is targeted by chemical inhibitors or antibodies. By relying on the viral function, the viral detection should be less sensitive to mutations. One possible use of this device could be for the production of effectors that can alert the human immune system for the presence of a virus (e.g., the production of interferons [IFNs], chemokines). Once the viral activity is detected, the device should be able to transduce this signal to activate the selected effector. The signaling device should produce a robust and specific signal."
Possible Role of Rickettsia felis in Acute Febrile Illness among Children in Gabon,"Rickettsia felis has been reported to be a cause of fever in sub-Saharan Africa, but this association has been poorly evaluated in Gabon. We assessed the prevalence of this bacterium among children <15 years of age in 4 areas of Gabon; the locations were in urban, semiurban, and rural areas. DNA samples from 410 febrile children and 60 afebrile children were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Overall, the prevalence of R. felis among febrile and afebrile children was 10.2% (42/410 children) and 3.3% (2/60 children), respectively. Prevalence differed among febrile children living in areas that are urban (Franceville, 1.3% [1/77]), semiurban (Koulamoutou, 2.1% [3/141]), and rural (Lastourville, 11.2% [15/134]; Fougamou, 39.7% [23/58]). Furthermore, in a rural area (Fougamou), R. felis was significantly more prevalent in febrile (39.7% [23/58]) than afebrile children (5.0% [1/20]). Additional studies are needed to better understand the pathogenic role of R. felis in this part of the world.","O ver the past decade, reported cases of malaria and associated deaths have declined in Africa (1). This decrease has led to a search for other causes of fever in Africa, where unexplained febrile illnesses are one of the major health problems. In some sub-Saharan Africa countries, malaria treatments are still administered without a biologic diagnosis. For example, an assessment of complicated malaria and other severe febrile illness cases in a pediatric ward in Libreville, Gabon, showed that 43.5% of the children who received an antimalarial treatment had microscopy test results negative for malaria (2) ."
,"Staffing patterns and nurses' working conditions are risk factors for healthcare-associated infections as well as occupational injuries and infections. Staffing shortages, especially of nurses, have been identified as one of the major factors expected to constrain hospitals' ability to deal with future outbreaks of emerging infections. These problems are compounded by a global nursing shortage. Understanding and improving nurses' working conditions can potentially decrease the incidence of many infectious diseases. Relevant research is reviewed, and policy options are discussed.","Nearly 3 million registered nurses (RNs) work in the United States. Ninety-five percent of these nurses are women, as are most of the 700,000 licensed practical nurses and >2 million unlicensed nurse assistants. Internationally, occupational distributions are similar."
"STING, DCs and the link between innate and adaptive tumor immunity","Cancer and the immune system are intimately related. Much of the bulk of tumors is comprised of stromal leukocytes with immune functions, which serve to both promote and inhibit tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. The T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are essential for tumor immunity, and these T cells are generated by cross-priming against tumor associated antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in this process, serving as the cellular link between innate and adaptive immunity. As a prerequisite for priming of adaptive immune responses, DCs must take up tumor antigens, process them and present them in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). DCs also serve as sensors of innate activation signals from cancer that are necessary for their activation and effective priming of cancer specific T cells. Here we discuss the role of DCs in the sensing of cancer and in priming the adaptive response against tumors. Furthermore, we present the essential role of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling pathway in producing type I interferons (IFNs) that are essential in this process.","Cancer and the immune system are intimately related.

"Estimates of Outbreak Risk from New Introductions of Ebola with Immediate and Delayed Transmission Control Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City","While the ongoing Ebola outbreak continues in the West Africa countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, health officials elsewhere prepare for new introductions of Ebola from infected evacuees or travelers. We analyzed transmission data from patients (i.e., evacuees, international travelers, and those with locally acquired illness) in countries other than the 3 with continuing Ebola epidemics and quantitatively assessed the outbreak risk from new introductions by using different assumptions for transmission control (i.e., immediate and delayed). Results showed that, even in countries that can quickly limit expected number of transmissions per case to <1, the probability that a single introduction will lead to a substantial number of transmissions is not negligible, particularly if transmission variability is high. Identifying incoming infected travelers before symptom onset can decrease worst-case outbreak sizes more than reducing transmissions from patients with locally acquired cases, but performing both actions can have a synergistic effect.","T he ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa, thought to have begun from a single index case in Guinea in December 2013 (1) , has produced thousands of cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia (2) . This Ebola outbreak is the largest and most widespread since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 (3) , and the probability of international spread outside of West Africa is not negligible (4) . By late April 2015, the virus had been introduced by 7 infected people traveling during their incubation or symptomatic periods to a country other than Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Liberia. Of these 7 cases, 1 led to an outbreak with 19 transmissions in Nigeria (5,6); 1 led to 2 transmissions in the United States (7, 8) ; 1 led to 7 transmissions in Mali (9,10); and 4 led to no transmissions in Mali (11), Senegal (12) , the United States (13) , and the United Kingdom (14) . Additionally, 20 persons who acquired infection in Africa were transferred to the United States and several European countries for treatment (15) , leading to 1 transmission in Spain (16) ."

Role of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in differentiation of mixed bacterial infection from 2009 H1N1 viral pneumonia,Background Mixed bacterial infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality during influenza pandemics. We evaluated procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in differentiating pneumonia caused by mixed bacterial and 2009 H1N1 influenza infection from 2009 H1N1 influenza infection alone.,"Since the first report of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in Mexico, 1 the 2009 H1N1 infection rapidly spread around the world, leading to a pandemic. According to the May 2010 World Health Organization report, H1N1 infections occurred in more than 214 countries which brought about more than 18 000 deaths. 2 Pneumonia, mixed bacterial infection, and aggravation of underlying conditions such as heart failure are well-known complications of influenza. [3] [4] [5] [6] Among these complications, mixed bacterial infection is especially known to increase the mortality and morbidity of influenza. 7, 8 As pandemic influenza strains generally cause self-limiting illnesses, it is crucial to accurately diagnose concurrent mixed bacterial infections."
,"Recent years have seen unprecedented investment in research and development for countermeasures for high-threat pathogens, including specific and ambitious objectives for development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The inadequate availability of biological reference materials for these pathogens poses a genuine obstacle in pursuit of these objectives, and the lack of a comprehensive and equitable framework for developing reference materials is a weakness. We outline the need for internationally standardized biological materials for high-threat pathogens as a core element of global health security. We also outline the key components of a framework for addressing this deficiency.","Although several hundred centers contribute to WHO collaborative studies, only 3 centers produce and hold IRPs. These centers are the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in England, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in the United States, and the Paul-Ehrlich Institute in Germany.

Face Mask Use and Control of Respiratory Virus Transmission in Households CME ACTIVITY,"Many countries are stockpiling face masks for use as a nonpharmaceutical intervention to control virus transmission during an infl uenza pandemic. We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non-fi ttested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of infl uenzalike illness (ILI) in households. Mask use adherence was self-reported. During the 2006 and 2007 winter seasons, 286 exposed adults from 143 households who had been exposed to a child with clinical respiratory illness were recruited. We found that adherence to mask use signifi cantly reduced the risk for ILI-associated infection, but <50% of participants wore masks most of the time. We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease. However, during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced.","tory syndrome (SARS), it is likely that antiviral drugs and vaccines will be in short supply or that delivery could be delayed. Therefore, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask use, handwashing, and other hygiene measures or school closure might be effective early control strategies. In contrast to pharmaceutical interventions, little is known about the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions in the community. A recent analysis gives estimates of the effect of school closure (1) , and several prospective, randomized controlled trials of handwashing have been published (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, clinical trial data on the ability of face masks to reduce respiratory virus transmission in the community are limited to 1 published prospective trial, which showed lack of effi cacy (12) . In addition, adverse effects of wearing masks (particularly respirators) may affect compliance and effectiveness (13) (14) (15) . Despite the lack of quantitative evidence, many countries have included recommendations in their pandemic plans on the use of face masks (16) (17) (18) . We present the results of a cluster-randomized household study of the effectiveness of using face masks to prevent or reduce transmission of infl uenza-like illness (ILI)."
,"The burden of infection in industrialized countries has prompted considerable effort to improve the outcomes of patients with sepsis. This has been formalized through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 'bundles', derived from the recommendations of 11 professional societies, which have promoted global improvement in those practices whose primary goal it is to reduce sepsis-related death. However, difficulties remain in implementing all of the procedures recommended by the experts, despite the apparent pragmatism of those procedures. We summarize the main proposals made by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and focus on the difficulties associated with making a proper diagnosis and supplying adequate treatment promptly to septic patients. CAP = community-acquired pneumonia; ED = emergency department; EGDT = early goal-directed therapy; ICU = intensive care unit; MEDS = Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis; rhAPC = recombinant human activated protein C; ScvO 2 = central venous oxygen saturation; SIRS = systemic inflammatory response syndrome.","Severe sepsis and septic shock are currently among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care, and their incidences have increased during the past decade as the population has aged [1, 2] . The emergency department (ED), where patients are treated for community-acquired infection, many of whom require intensive care unit (ICU) management [3] , has been identified as a setting in which these syndromes and their outcomes may readily be observed."
,"With the spread of avian influenza, use of automated data streams to rapidly detect and track human influenza cases has increased. We performed correlation analyses to determine whether International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), groupings used to detect influenzalike illness (ILI) within an automated syndromic system correlate with respiratory virus laboratory test results in the same population (r = 0.71 or 0.86, depending on group). We used temporal and signal-to-noise analysis to identify 2 subsets of ICD-9 codes that most accurately represent ILI trends, compared nationwide sentinel ILI surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the automated data (r = 0.97), and found the most sensitive set of ICD-9 codes for respiratory illness surveillance. Our results demonstrate a method for selecting the best group of ICD-9 codes to assist system developers and health officials who are interpreting similar data for daily public health activities.","I nevitable annual cycles of influenza and other respiratory pathogens pose a significant threat to work and productivity (1) (2) (3) . Epidemics can have dramatic economic and medical ramifications, such as the influenza pandemic of 1918 (4,5). During the last few years we have witnessed the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and new pathogenic avian influenza strains. These events have brought respiratory illnesses to the attention of the general public; most recently, the highly publicized potential for pandemic influenza due to recombinant influenza strains has generated tremendous public anxiety. Moreover, lingering fears about influenzalike illness (ILI) symptoms related to bioterrorism have further accentuated the need for improved early detection of respiratory disease outbreaks."
"Confronting Zoonoses, Linking Human and Veterinary Medicine Zoonoses, Links between Human and Veterinary Medicine Emerging Infectious Diseases • www","Many of the emerging infectious diseases, including those caused by bioterrorist agents, are zoonoses. Since zoonoses can infect both animals and humans, the medical and veterinary communities should work closely together in clinical, public health, and research settings. In the clinical setting, input from both professions would improve assessments of the risk-benefit ratios of pet ownership, particularly for pet owners who are immunocompromised. In public health, human and animal disease surveillance systems are important in tracking and controlling zoonoses such as avian influenza virus, West Nile virus, and foodborne pathogens. Comparative medicine is the study of disease processes across species, including humans. Physician and veterinarian comparative medicine research teams should be promoted and encouraged to study zoonotic agent-host interactions. These efforts would increase our understanding of how zoonoses expand their host range and would, ultimately, improve prevention and control strategies.","Z oonoses are diseases that can be transmitted from wild and domestic animals to humans and are public health threats worldwide. Because these diseases come from animals, prevention and control strategies need to be innovative and require the combined efforts of many fields. For example, closer collaborations are needed between veterinarians, physicians, and public health professionals in 3 areas: individual health, population health, and comparative medicine research. In the individual health setting, assessing the potential for zoonotic disease transmission from animals to humans should include input from both physicians and veterinarians, especially for patients at high risk such as those who are immunocompromised. In population health, zoonotic disease threats should be addressed through surveillance systems that include domestic and wild animal and human populations, which would help lead to effective control measures. Since physicians and veterinarians would be the key professionals to recognize and report outbreaks, enhanced communications between hospital epidemiologists, veterinarians, and local public health officials would not only help expedite a local response, but also help identify whether unusual diseases or outbreaks involving animals and humans were related or separate events. In the research setting, collaboration between physicians and veterinarians in comparative medicine would improve our understanding of zoonotic agenthost interactions."
"To assess the temporal dynamics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in dromedary camels, specimens were collected at 1-2 month intervals from 2 independent groups of animals during MERS-CoV in Upper Respiratory Tract and Lungs of Dromedary Camels, Saudi Arabia, 2013-2014","in Al-Ahsa Province, Saudi Arabia, and tested for MERS-CoV RNA by reverse transcription PCR. Of 96 live camels, 28 (29.2%) nasal swab samples were positive; of 91 camel carcasses, 56 (61.5%) lung tissue samples were positive. Positive samples were more commonly found among young animals (<4 years of age) than adults (>4 years of age). The proportions of positive samples varied by month for both groups;","M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging pathogen associated with severe respiratory symptoms and renal failure in infected persons (1, 2) . Saudi Arabia is the country most severely affected by the virus and is where the first recognized case was identified in 2012. The origin of MERS-CoV remains a mystery. Bats seem to be the reservoir host of the virus (3) but are probably not the source of the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak because of limited contact with humans in the Arabian Peninsula. Early observations that some MERS-CoV-infected persons had been exposed to camels suggested a possible role of these animals as intermediate reservoir hosts (2, 4) . Serologic surveys subsequently conducted in several countries in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa identified high rates of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in dromedary camels (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Furthermore, MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels was definitively proven by the detection of virus and virus sequences in respiratory specimens, feces, and milk collected from camels in Qatar (9, 13) , Oman (14) , Saudi Arabia (5, 15, 16) , and Egypt (17) ."
Transmission of communicable respiratory infections and facemasks,"Background: Respiratory protection effi ciency of facemasks is critically important in the battle against communicable respiratory infections such as infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We studied the spatial distributions of simulated virus-laden respiratory droplets when human subjects wore facemasks and were exposed to regulatory viral droplets by conducting in vivo experiments in facemask use. Methods: Transmission pathway of aerosols of Fluorescein-KCl solution through facemasks and protective effi ciency of facemasks were examined by using normal surgical facemasks and two facemasks with exhaust valves (Facemask A) and exhaust holes (Facemask B) covered with the same surgical fi lters situated at the back of the facemasks. Fluorescein-KCl solution was sprayed onto the faces of participants wearing the facemasks and performing intermittent exercises on a treadmill in a climatic chamber. Results: Experimental results showed that when droplets spread onto a person face-to-face over short distances, 92.3% to 99.5% of droplets were blocked by the front surface of the facemask, whereas only 0.5% to 7.7% of droplets reached the back of the facemask. Both facemasks A and B had near or over 99% protection effi ciency, compared with that of 95.5% to 97% of surgical facemasks. Using the same fi lters as normal surgical masks, facemasks A and B provided more effective respiratory protection against communicable respiratory infections such as infl uenza and SARS by the location of the breathing pathway to the back of the facemasks. Conclusions: Separating the breathing pathway from the virus-contaminated area in facemasks can provide more effective protection against communicable respiratory infections such as infl uenza and SARS.","An infl uenza pandemic has the potential to cause more death and illness than any other public health threat (DHHS 2005) . Since January 2004, a total of 240 human cases of avian infl uenza A (H5N1) have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and of these cases, 141 were killed by H5N1 (WHO 2006) . Therefore, Monto (2005) pointed out that the greatest concern is that human-to-human transmission may begin if there is a change in the vital genome of avian infl uenza."
Inhibition of SARS Coronavirus Infection In Vitro with Clinically Approved Antiviral Drugs,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a newly identified human coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Currently, no effective drug exists to treat SARS-CoV infection. In this study, we investigated whether a panel of commercially available antiviral drugs exhibit in vitro anti-SARS-CoV activity. A drugscreening assay that scores for virus-induced cytopathic effects on cultured cells was used. Tested were 19 clinically approved compounds from several major antiviral pharmacologic classes: nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. Complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for interferon subtypes, β-1b, α-n1, α-n3, and human leukocyte interferon a. These findings support clinical testing of approved interferons for the treatment of SARS.","S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1, 2) is an infectious disease caused by a newly identified human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4) . The disease can produce severe pneumonia with a reported fatal outcome of 15% to 20%. Currently, no effective drug exists to treat SARS-CoV infection (5) . The urgency of the outbreak has led to the empiric use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral agents in affected patients in several countries (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Intensive efforts are under way to gain more insight into the mechanisms of viral replication, in order to develop targeted antiviral therapies and vaccines. Developing effective and safe vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents against SARS CoV, however, may take years."
Communication in the Toronto critical care community: important lessons learned during SARS,"The SARS outbreak in 2003 pushed Toronto's health care system to its limits. Staffing shortages, transmission of SARS within the ICU, and the influx of critically ill SARS patients were some unique challenges to the delivery of critical care. Communication strategies were a key component in the critical care response to SARS. Regular teleconference calls, web-based training and education, and the rapid coordination of research studies were some of the initiatives developed within the Toronto critical care community during the SARS outbreak. Other critical care communities should consider their communication strategies in advance of similar events.","In the spring of 2003, Toronto found itself in the midst of a worldwide outbreak of SARS. The Toronto outbreak followed a biphasic course lasting from 5 March to 12 June. A total of 375 probable and suspect cases of SARS (as defined using World Health Organization criteria [1] ) were reported in Ontario, of which 44 died [2] . The vast majority of these cases were contracted in hospital by patients, visitors, and health care workers [3] . This unexpected outbreak pushed Toronto's health care system to its limits and presented many challenges to the delivery of critical care."
,"Despite limited evidence regarding their utility, infrared thermal detection systems (ITDS) are increasingly being used for mass fever detection. We compared temperature measurements for 3 ITDS (FLIR ThermoVision A20M [FLIR Systems Inc., Boston, MA, USA], OptoTherm Thermoscreen [OptoTherm Thermal Imaging Systems and Infrared Cameras Inc., Sewickley, PA, USA], and Wahl Fever Alert Imager HSI2000S [Wahl Instruments Inc., Asheville, NC, USA]) with oral temperatures (>100°F = confi rmed fever) and self-reported fever. Of 2,873 patients enrolled, 476 (16.6%) reported a fever, and 64 (2.2%) had a confi rmed fever. Self-reported fever had a sensitivity of 75.0%, specifi city 84.7%, and positive predictive value 10.1%. At optimal cutoff values for detecting fever, temperature measurements by OptoTherm and FLIR had greater sensitivity (91.0% and 90.0%, respectively) and specifi city (86.0% and 80.0%, respectively) than did self-reports. Correlations between ITDS and oral temperatures were similar for Opto-Therm (ρ = 0.43) and FLIR (ρ = 0.42) but signifi cantly lower for Wahl (ρ = 0.14; p<0.001). When compared with oral temperatures, 2 systems (OptoTherm and FLIR) were reasonably accurate for detecting fever and predicted fever better than self-reports.","A dvancements in transportation coupled with the growth and movement of human populations enable effi cient transport of infectious diseases almost anywhere in the world within 24 hours (1) . This recognition has prompted the evaluation of rapid mass screening methods to delay the importation of infection into healthcare settings, communities, and countries (1) (2) (3) (4) . Because fever is a common indicator of many infectious diseases, the rapid identifi cation of fever is a major component of screening efforts. Such screening was used by many countries during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 and the infl uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak (2, 3, (5) (6) (7) (8) . Despite widespread implementation of fever screening, its value for detecting highly communicable diseases has mainly been established through mathematical modeling rather than through studies in humans (9, 10) ."
Use of Unstructured Event-Based Reports for Global Infectious Disease Surveillance,"Free or low-cost sources of unstructured information, such as Internet news and online discussion sites, provide detailed local and near real-time data on disease outbreaks, even in countries that lack traditional public health surveillance. To improve public health surveillance and, ultimately, interventions, we examined 3 primary systems that process event-based outbreak information: Global Public Health Intelligence Network, HealthMap, and EpiSPIDER. Despite similarities among them, these systems are highly complementary because they monitor different data types, rely on varying levels of automation and human analysis, and distribute distinct information. Future development should focus on linking these systems more closely to public health practitioners in the fi eld and establishing collaborative networks for alert verifi cation and dissemination. Such development would further establish event-based monitoring as an invaluable public health resource that provides critical context and an alternative to traditional indicator-based outbreak reporting.","I nternational travel and movement of goods increasingly facilitates the spread of pathogens across and among nations, enabling pathogens to invade new territories and adapt to new environments and hosts (1) (2) (3) . Offi cials now need to consider worldwide disease outbreaks when determining what potential threats might affect the health and welfare of their nations (4) . In industrialized countries, unprecedented efforts have built on indicator-based public health surveillance, and monitoring of clinically relevant data sources now provides early indication of outbreaks (5) . In many countries where public health infrastructure is rudimentary, deteriorating, or nonexistent, efforts to improve the ability to conduct electronic disease surveillance include more robust data collection methods and enhanced analysis capability (6, 7) . However, in these parts of the world, basing timely and sensitive reporting of public health threats on conventional surveillance sources remains challenging. Lack of resources and trained public health professionals poses a substantial roadblock (8) (9) (10) . Furthermore, reporting emerging infectious diseases has certain constraints, including fear of repercussions on trade and tourism, delays in clearance through multiple levels of government, tendency to err on the conservative side, and inadequately functioning or nonexistent surveillance infrastructure (11) . Even with the recent enactment of international health regulations in 2005, no guarantee yet exists that broad compliance will be feasible, given the challenges associated with reporting mechanisms and multilateral coordination (12) ."

Evaluation of admissions to the Major Incident Hospital based on a standardized protocol,"Introduction The Major Incident Hospital (MIH) is a unique facility strictly reserved to provide immediate largescale emergency care for victims of disasters and major incidents. We evaluated the implemented organization to identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide knowledge essential for further improvement of preparedness.

Polyadenylation of genomic RNA and initiation of antigenomic RNA in a positive-strand RNA virus are controlled by the same cis-element,"Genomes and antigenomes of many positive-strand RNA viruses contain 3 0 -poly(A) and 5 0 -poly(U) tracts, respectively, serving as mutual templates. Mechanism(s) controlling the length of these homopolymeric stretches are not well understood.","The genomic RNA of many positive-strand RNA viruses is tailed with a 3 0 -poly(A). In contrast to cellular mRNAs, in which poly(A) is non-templated and is added posttranscriptionally, the viral poly(A) is believed to be templatecoded (1) . Accordingly, the negative strand contains a 5 0 -poly(U) tract, which is synthesized using the poly(A) of the positive viral RNA as a template. In turn, this poly(U) subsequently serves as a template for the synthesis of the poly(A) of progeny RNA. This alternate usage of the homopolymeric parts of the (+) and (À) RNA for each strand synthesis has not been studied in detail but it was observed that poly(U) in the negative RNA of poliovirus (2, 3) and coronavirus (4) may be shorter than poly(A) in the viral RNAs. These observations pose intriguing questions about how a shorter poly(U) is synthesized on a longer poly(A) template and vice versa."
Hypothesis Design of a set of probes with high potential for influenza virus epidemiological surveillance,"An Influenza Probe Set (IPS) consisting in 1,249 9-mer probes for genomic fingerprinting of closely and distantly related Influenza Virus strains was designed and tested in silico. The IPS was derived from alignments of Influenza genomes. The RNA segments of 5,133 influenza strains having diverse degree of relatedness were concatenated and aligned. After alignment, 9-mer sites having high Shannon entropy were searched. Additional criteria such as: G+C content between 35 to 65%, absence of dimer or trimer consecutive repeats, a minimum of 2 differences between 9mers and selecting only sequences with Tm values between 34.5 and 36.5oC were applied for selecting probes with high sequential entropy. Virtual Hybridization was used to predict Genomic Fingerprints to assess the capability of the IPS to discriminate between influenza and related strains. Distance scores between pairs of Influenza Genomic Fingerprints were calculated, and used for estimating Taxonomic Trees. Visual examination of both Genomic Fingerprints and Taxonomic Trees suggest that the IPS is able to discriminate between distant and closely related Influenza strains. It is proposed that the IPS can be used to investigate, by virtual or experimental hybridization, any new, and potentially virulent, strain.","Influenza viruses are part of Orthomixoviridae Family and possess segmented genomes consisting of seven or eight separate RNA molecules, each coding for one or more viral proteins. The viruses can exchange segments, leading to diversity of reassortant strains. Together with accumulation of point mutations, segment reassortment is the basis for evolution and maintenance of diversity for these viruses. It provides them with the ability to rapidly adapt to the pressure of the host immune system and leads to the continuous emergence of new virus variants that cause seasonal and pandemic outbreaks of influenza. Because of this ability, segmented viruses can exist in numerous genotypes and serotypes, presenting a challenge to the creation of protective vaccines and detection methods [1, 2] ."

Influenza surveillance in Europe: establishing epidemic thresholds by the Moving Epidemic Method,Background Timely influenza surveillance is important to monitor influenza epidemics.,"Influenza causes respiratory infections in humans, leads to increased consultations in general practice and is an important global cause of hospital admissions and mortality. 1, 2 While attack rates are highest among children, mortality rates are typically highest in elderly populations and among persons suffering from chronic and underlying conditions. 3, 4 Influenza produces substantial direct healthcare costs, and even greater indirect costs associated with the loss of both labour and school days. [5] [6] [7] Consequently, influenza is an important burden on human health and a challenge for health services, making it a priority for surveillance activities, which can help to better prioritise the efforts in prevention and control."
Risk Management and Health Care Policy,"This research assessed factors associated with willingness to comply with vaccination, isolation, and face mask wearing during an anticipated infl uenza pandemic. Data were collected from 2081 adults (16+) using a module of questions incorporated into the NSW Health Adult Population Health Survey. High levels of willingness to comply were reported with 73% either very or extremely willing to receive vaccination, 67% willing to isolate themselves, 58% willing to wear a face mask, and 48% willing to comply with all three behaviors. Further analysis indicated concern for self and family and higher levels of education were associated with high levels of willingness to comply. Younger people (16-24) were the least willing to comply; especially with wearing a face mask. Those with children reported higher levels of willingness to receive vaccination, and respondents who speak a language other than English at home were less willing to isolate themselves or comply with all behaviors. These fi ndings provide a baseline measure of anticipated public compliance with key public health behaviors in the event of an infl uenza pandemic in the Australian population, and help to identify groups that may be more resistant to individual measures and may require additional attention in terms of risk communication strategies or health education.","Willingness of the general public to comply with protective public health measures in the event of pandemic infl uenza is necessary for success in disease response and containment. In addition, better estimates of population compliance with such measures is valuable when assessing their contributions in the mathematical modeling of pandemics and in estimating the effectiveness of pandemic control decisions and policies; both in terms of disease containment and cost. A recent systematic review of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory diseases 1 has clearly demonstrated the signifi cant contribution of simple low-cost interventions, such as mask-wearing and hand washing. Data in this review, from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related studies, indicated that mask-wearing reduced risk of spread by 68%; a fi gure that increased to 91% if N95 masks were worn."

A novel submicron emulsion system loaded with vincristine-oleic acid ion-pair complex with improved anticancer effect: in vitro and in vivo studies,"Background: Vincristine (VCR), which is a widely used antineoplastic drug, was integrated with a submicron-emulsion drug-delivery system to enhance the anticancer effect. Methods: After the formation of a VCR-oleic acid ion-pair complex (VCR-OA), the VCR-OAloaded submicron emulsion (VCR-OA-SME), prepared by classical high-pressure homogenization, was characterized and its in vitro anticancer effects were evaluated. Results: The submicron-emulsion formulation exhibited a homogeneous round shape. The mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were 157.6 ± 12.6 nm, −26.5 ± 5.0 mV and 78.64% ± 3.44%, respectively. An in vitro release study of the VCR-OA-SME revealed that 12.4% of the VCR was released within the first 2 hours (initial burst-release phase) and the rest of the drug was detected in the subsequent sustained-release phase. Compared with VCR solution, the pharmacokinetic study of VCR-OA-SME showed relatively longer mean residence time (mean residence time [0-∞] increased from 187.19 to 227.56 minutes), higher maximum concentration (from 252.13 ng/mL to 533.34 ng/mL), and greater area under the curve (area under the curve [0-∞] from 11,417.77 µg/L/minute to 17,164.34 µg/L/minute. Moreover, the VCR-OA-SME exhibited higher cytotoxicity (P , 0.05) on tumor cells by inducing cell arrest in the G 2 /M phase or even apoptosis (P , 0.05). Conclusion: The VCR-OA-SME formulation in our study displayed great potential for an anticancer effect for VCR.","Vincristine (VCR, Figure 1A) , isolated from the leaves of the periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus, 1 is a widely used antineoplastic drug in the clinic, especially for pediatric and adult malignancies. 2 It is a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug that mainly interferes with mitotic spindle microtubules [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and induces tumor cell apoptosis. [7] [8] [9] In the past few decades, optimizing the formulation and then improving its anticancer effect has attracted much attention. The investigated formulation includes microemulsions, 10 common nanoparticles, 11 conventional liposomes, 12 sterical liposomes, 13 and targeted nanoparticles. 14 The clinical applications of the above carriers are largely limited by their complex components and/or complicated production process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a VCR vehicle with higher anticancer effects. Emulsion is a commonly acceptable formulation that has been used in clinics for years, and microemulsion [15] [16] [17] and submicron emulsion 18, 19 have been studied extensively. These vehicles can be administered via parenteral, 10, 20 transdermal, 19 and ocular 21 routes. Wang et al prepared a micron emulsion to carry VCR, 10 which was stable and exhibited greater antitumor effect. However, this formulation contained a special component poly(ethylene glycol)distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine that largely increased the cost of preparation and caused some side effects after repeated administrations, such as accelerated blood clearance. [22] [23] [24] [25] What's more, the possible mechanism of the improved anticancer effect was still unclear at the cellular level."
,"A high percentage of camel handlers in Saudi Arabia are seropositive for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We found that 12/100 camel handlers and their family members in Pakistan, a country with extensive camel MERS-CoV infection, were seropositive, indicating that MERS-CoV infection of these populations extends beyond the Arabian Peninsula.","M iddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, causes a highly lethal pneumonia with a 34.5% mortality rate (https://www. who.int/emergencies/mers-cov). As of July 31, 2019, a total of 2,458 cases and 848 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization, with all cases in the Middle East or in travelers from this region or their contacts (1) . MERS cases fall into 2 categories, primary and secondary. Secondary cases, which result most commonly from human-to-human transmission in hospitals, were most prominent during the early years of the outbreak. However, as stringent infection control measures have been followed more closely, a greater proportion of cases are classified as primary. Camels are believed to be the zoonotic source for primary infections, but a large proportion of patients describe no camel contact, raising the question of how they acquired the disease (2) ."
Visualization of HTLV-1YSpecific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes in the Spinal Cords of Patients With HTLV-1YAssociated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis,"Activated human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)Yspecific CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are markedly increased in the periphery of patients with HTLV-1Yassociated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), an HTLV-1Yinduced inflammatory disease of the CNS. Although virus-specific CTLs play a pivotal role to eliminate virus-infected cells, the potential role of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the infiltration of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs and the expression of HTLV-1 proteins in the spinal cords of 3 patients with HAM/TSP. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with our unique staining procedure made it possible to visualize HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs infiltrating the CNS of the HAM/TSP patients. The frequency of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs was more than 20% of CD8-positive cells infiltrating the CNS. In addition, HTLV-1 proteins were detected in CD4-positive infiltrating T lymphocytes but not CNS resident cells. Although neurons were generally preserved, apoptotic oligodendrocytes were frequently in contact with CD8-positive cells; this likely resulted in demyelination. These findings suggest that the immune responses of the CTLs against HTLV-1Yinfected CD4-positive lymphocytes migrating into the CNS resulted in bystander neural damage.","Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is estimated to affect 1 to 2 Â 10 7 people worldwide. Although HTLV-1 infection is lifelong, the majority of infected individuals remain asymptomatic; only 1% to 2% of these individuals develop HTLV-1Yassociated diseases, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (1) , and a range of chronic inflammatory diseases, including myelopathy (2Y4), uveitis (5) , arthritis (6) , polymyositis (7, 8) , inclusion-body myositis (9, 10) , and alveolitis (11) . The most recognized inflammatory disease is HTLV-1Yassociated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), in which CNS lesions correspond to progressive weakness of the lower extremities, with spasticity, urinary incontinence, and mild sensory disturbance. Patients with HAM/TSP exhibit higher HTLV-1 proviral load in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (12) . Furthermore, HTLV-1Yinfected cells accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on neurologic exacerbation (13) . One of the most striking features of the cellular immune response in patients with HAM/TSP is the highly elevated numbers of HTLV-1Yspecific CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in PBMCs compared with asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (14, 15) . These CTLs produce proinflammatory cytokines (16, 17) . The HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs are thought to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP (18, 19) . This persistently activated CTL immune response to HTLV-1 provides unequivocal evidence of persistent HTLV-1 antigen expression in vivo. To date, no previous studies have shown CTLs and HTLV-1 proteins in CNS tissues from patients with HAM/TSP. Although Skinner et al visualized antigen-specific T cells with nonfrozen tissues (20) , the method has not been adapted to frozen tissue samples. In this study, we established novel in situ staining methods for detecting virus-specific CTLs and HTLV-1 proteins in frozen human tissue samples. We detected a number of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs and HTLV-1Yinfected CD4-positive cells infiltrating the CNS and verified the bystander hypothesis that the interaction between HTLV-1Y specific CTLs and HTLV-1Yinfected T lymphocytes causes damage to bystander neural cells in the CNS (21) . family members and stored them at j80-C until use. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax11-19 (LLFGYPVYV) and Tax301-309 (SFHSLHLLF) are well-characterized immunodominant epitopes that are restricted to HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*24, respectively (22, 23) . Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed in all of the autopsied samples (24) . Three samples were found suitable for use in this study. The first was from an HLA-A*02Ypositive patient (No. 8624), the second was from an HLA-A*24Ypositive patient (No. 6315), and the third was from an HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*24 doubleY positive patient (No. 6664). We had frozen block samples from entire levels of the spinal cord of each patient. We first evaluated each block by routine histology and used the samples with inflammatory lesions for the study. The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . This study was approved by the Kagoshima University Ethics Committee."
Implications of Host Genetic Variation on the Risk and Prevalence of Infectious Diseases Transmitted Through the Environment,"Previous studies have shown that host genetic heterogeneity in the response to infectious challenge can affect the emergence risk and the severity of diseases transmitted through direct contact between individuals. However, there is substantial uncertainty about the degree and direction of influence owing to different definitions of genetic variation, most of which are not in line with the current understanding of the genetic architecture of disease traits. Also, the relevance of previous results for diseases transmitted through environmental sources is unclear. In this article a compartmental genetic-epidemiological model was developed to quantify the impact of host genetic diversity on epidemiological characteristics of diseases transmitted through a contaminated environment. The model was parameterized for footrot in sheep. Genetic variation was defined through continuous distributions with varying shape and degree of dispersion for different disease traits. The model predicts a strong impact of genetic heterogeneity on the disease risk and its progression and severity, as well as on observable host phenotypes, when dispersion in key epidemiological parameters is high. The impact of host variation depends on the disease trait for which variation occurs and on environmental conditions affecting pathogen survival. In particular, compared to homogeneous populations with the same average susceptibility, disease risk and severity are substantially higher in populations containing a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals, and the differences are strongest when environmental contamination is low. The implications of our results for the recording and analysis of disease data and for predicting response to selection are discussed.","interest in the impact of individual differences has been sparked by the accumulating evidence of the important role of ""superspreaders"" in the outbreak of epidemics (e.g., Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Yates et al. 2006) , as recently reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans (Shen et al. 2004 ) and various livestock diseases (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Matthews et al. 2006) . Superspreading events are characterized by a small proportion of individuals contributing a disproportionally large amount to the transmission of infectious agents (e.g., by unusually large numbers of contact or by supershedding with unusually effective excretion of infectious agents into the environment) and can be considered as extreme cases of host heterogeneity."
Social Responses to Epidemics Depicted by Cinema,"Films illustrate 2 ways that epidemics can affect societies: fear leading to a breakdown in sociability and fear stimulating preservation of tightly held social norms. The first response is often informed by concern over perceived moral failings within society, the second response by the application of arbitrary or excessive controls from outside the community.","F ilms related to themes of disease, infection, and contagion often fall into 1 of 3 broad categories connected to fantasy, science fiction, or horror: apocalyptic destruction or near destruction of the whole of humanity, rising concerns over bioterrorism, and the rise of an undead or form of zombie existence (1) . Although films traditionally deal sensitively or realistically with the topic of HIV/AIDS (e.g., Dallas Buyers Club, Philadelphia, And the Band Played On, Kids), often through melodrama, fewer films have dealt with other epidemic diseases, as either direct subject material or background context. Of these more realistic or semirealistic films about epidemics, scholarly literature has focused on the inadequacy of capturing the correct science behind disease transmission, spread, and illness (2) (3) (4) or anachronistic characters in films concerning historical epidemics (5) . Notwithstanding broader discussions of society-disease interaction in the media (6) , the social responses to various diseases portrayed in films have been discussed less frequently."
Antiviral activity of a Bacillus sp. P34 peptide against pathogenic viruses of domestic animals,"P34 is an antimicrobial peptide produced by a Bacillus sp. strain isolated from the intestinal contents of a fish in the Brazilian Amazon basin with reported antibacterial activity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the peptide P34 for its in vitro antiviral properties against canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), equine arteritis virus (EAV), equine influenza virus (EIV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1). The results showed that the peptide P34 exhibited antiviral activity against EAV and FHV-1. The peptide P34 inhibited the replication of EAV by 99.9% and FHV-1 by 94.4%. Virucidal activity was detected only against EAV. When P34 and EAV were incubated for 6 h at 37°C the viral titer reduced from 10 4.5 TCID 50 to 10 2.75 TCID 50 , showing a percent of inhibition of 98.6%. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that P34 inhibited EAV and FHV-1 replication in infected cell cultures and it showed virucidal activity against EAV. Since there is documented resistance to the current drugs used against herpesviruses and there is no treatment for equine viral arteritis, it is advisable to search for new antiviral compounds to overcome these infections.","The impact of the increasing resistance of microorganisms to drugs and specific antimicrobial substances has motivated several research groups. Since their discovery, the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are conquering special attention as important therapeutic alternatives for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by a large number of microorganisms (Oyston et al., 2009) . AMPs are universal features of the defense systems of all forms of life, with representatives found in organisms ranging from pinta (Leporinus sp.) (Motta et al., 2007b) . This peptide was purified and named P34 and its antimicrobial activity was characterized as a fengycin-like substance (Motta et al., 2007a) . Its inhibitory activity was detected against Gram-positive bacteria, like Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus (Motta et al., 2007b) , and Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis (Motta et al., 2008) . While some studies on P34 have shown its importance as a potential food preservative (Motta et al., 2007a) , little attention has been addressed to its application as an antimicrobial substance in clinical studies."
The Role of Carbohydrates in Infection Strategies of Enteric Pathogens,"Enteric pathogens cause considerable public health concerns worldwide including tropical regions. Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.","Enteric pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, exert a major impact on public health worldwide including tropical regions. In humans and animals, the enteric pathogens, which include viruses, bacteria and protozoa, infect the intestine epithelial lining, resulting in food poisoning or diarrheal disease. When enteric pathogens enter humans or animals via the oral route, they must withstand the proteolytic conditions in the stomach before penetrating the mucus layer and accessing the underlying gut epithelium for attachment or cell invasion. Adhesion of the enteric pathogens to the intestine epithelial tissue is a prerequisite for the initiation of infection. In many systems it is mediated by lectins present on the surface of the pathogen that bind to complementary carbohydrates on the surface of the host cells. Carbohydrates such as heparan sulfate have been reported to play a crucial role in the entry or budding of viruses [1] , and bacterial lectins typically act in the form of elongated submicroscopic multisubunit protein appendages, known as pili [2] . Recently, the surface proteins of apicomplexan parasites have also been reported to bind to carbohydrates on host cells [3] . Thus the initial steps of host cell recognition by enteric pathogens may incorporate common strategies."
Probiotic Use in Horses -What is the Evidence for Their Clinical Efficacy?,"The gastrointestinal microbiota is extremely important for human and animal health. Investigations into the composition of the microbiota and its therapeutic modification have received increasing interest in human and veterinary medicine. Probiotics are a way of modifying the microbiota and have been tested to prevent and treat diseases. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways. Production of antimicrobial compounds targeting intestinal pathogens, general immune stimulation, and colonization resistance are among these mechanisms. Despite widespread availability and use, scientific, peer-reviewed evidence behind commercial probiotic formulations in horses is limited. Additionally, quality control of commercial over-the-counter products is not tightly regulated. Although promising in vitro results have been achieved, in vivo health benefits have been more difficult to prove. Whether the ambiguous results are caused by strain selection, dosage selection or true lack of efficacy remains to be answered. Although these limitations exist, probiotics are increasingly used because of their lack of severe adverse effects, ease of administration, and low cost. This review summarizes the current evidence for probiotic use in equine medicine. It aims to provide veterinarians with evidence-based information on when and why probiotics are indicated for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in horses. The review also outlines the current state of knowledge on the equine microbiota and the potential of fecal microbial transplantation, as they relate to the topic of probiotics.","T he concept of the human microbiota was first introduced to the scientific community by Joshua Lederberg in 2001. He defined the microbiota as 'the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space and have been all but ignored as determinants of health and disease'. 1 Since then, interest in the intestinal microbiota has culminated in large-scale endeavors such as the Human Microbiota Project, 2 and has also made its way into veterinary medicine."
Review Article Delivery Systems for the Direct Application of siRNAs to Induce RNA Interference (RNAi) In Vivo,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for specific gene silencing which may also lead to promising novel therapeutic strategies. It is mediated through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which sequence-specifically trigger the cleavage and subsequent degradation of their target mRNA. One critical factor is the ability to deliver intact siRNAs into target cells/organs in vivo. This review highlights the mechanism of RNAi and the guidelines for the design of optimal siRNAs. It gives an overview of studies based on the systemic or local application of naked siRNAs or the use of various nonviral siRNA delivery systems. One promising avenue is the the complexation of siRNAs with the polyethylenimine (PEI), which efficiently stabilizes siRNAs and, upon systemic administration, leads to the delivery of the intact siRNAs into different organs. The antitumorigenic effects of PEI/siRNA-mediated in vivo gene-targeting of tumor-relevant proteins like in mouse tumor xenograft models are described.","Altered expression levels of certain genes play a pivotal role in several pathological conditions. For example, in many cancers the upregulation of certain growth factors or growth factor receptors, or the deregulation of intracellular signal transduction pathways, represents key elements in the process of malignant transformation and progression of normal cells towards tumor cells leading to uncontrolled proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Since these processes may result in the direct, autocrine stimulation of the tumor cell itself as well as the paracrine stimulation of other cells, including the stimulation of tumor-angiogenesis, many novel therapeutic strategies focus on the reversal of this effect, that is, the inhibition of these proteins or the downregulation of their expression. Likewise, several other diseases have been firmly linked to the (over-)expression of endogenous wildtype or mutated genes. Taken together, in addition to strategies based on the inhibition of target proteins, for example, by low molecular weight inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies, this opens an avenue to gene-targeting approaches aiming at decreased expression of the respective gene."
Social Support and Response to AIDS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"Negative public reactions to emerging infectious diseases can adversely affect population health. We assessed whether social support was associated with knowledge of, worry about, and attitudes towards AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Our fi ndings suggest that social support may be central to our understanding of public responses to emerging infectious diseases.","The ability of public health institutions to effectively manage emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and mitigate their consequences is partly a function of public reaction to an epidemic. Negative reactions may vary from denial to panic to stigmatization. Denial or minimization of the threat of an EID by the population at risk can impede prevention efforts and increase transmission. Alternatively, an overreaction to the threat of an EID can overwhelm public health systems and resources, divert resources from effective disease control activities, and lead to severe economic losses in areas affected by the disease. Stigmatization can increase problems of persons with the disease and facilitate transmission because persons with or at risk for the disease may avoid seeking healthcare and because governments may attempt to suppress information about EIDs, considering their potentially severe economic consequences. From a public health policy perspective, identifying personal characteristics and resources that predict responses of persons to EIDs is important to improve the ability of the public to learn about, rationally appraise the threat of, and minimize stigmatization of EIDs."
Early Days of Food and Environmental Virology,"In July 1962, the author joined the Food Research Institute (FRI), then at the University of Chicago, to become its food virologist. There was a limited record of waterborne viral disease outbreaks at the time; recorded data on foodborne outbreaks were fewer still. Laboratory environmental (water and wastewater) virology was in its infancy, and food virology was in gestation. Detection of viruses was most often attempted by inoculation of primary primate cell cultures, with observation for plaque formation or cytopathic effects. Focus was initially on enteroviruses and reoviruses. Environmental and food samples had to be liquefied if not already in liquid form; clarified to remove solids, bacteria, and fungi; and concentrated to a volume that could be tested in cell culture. Cytotoxicity was also a concern. Studies at the FRI and some other laboratories addressed all of these challenges. The FRI group was the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Food Virology for many years. Other topics studied were virus inactivation as functions of temperature, time, matrix, disinfectants, and microbial action; peroral and ex-vivo infectivity; and the suitability of various virus surrogates for environmental monitoring and inactivation experiments. Detection of noroviruses and hepatitis A virus required molecular methods, most often RT-PCR. When it was found that inactivated virus often gave the same RT-PCR signal as that of infectious virus, sample treatments were sought, which would prevent false-positive test results. Many laboratories around the world have taken up food and environmental virology since 1962, with the result that a dedicated journal has been launched.","I am delighted to have this opportunity to share some reminiscences of the evolution of food and environmental virology. Although this is largely a first-person account and subject to the problems of a failing memory, I console myself with the thought that most of what is known of evolution has been learned from old fossils. My research in environmental virology began in 1962. Only virology is addressed in this narrative, although our group worked with other intestinal pathogens (bacteria, protozoa, etc.) at times. My research career has led me to view the world as though peering outward through the anal orifice-''reverse proctoscopy'' has contributed significantly to addressing problems in unusual ways."
Maintenance of PD-1 on brain-resident memory CD8 T cells is antigen-independent,"Infection of the central nervous system by murine polyomavirus (MuPyV), a persistent natural mouse pathogen, establishes brain-resident memory CD8 T cells (bT RM ) that uniformly and chronically express PD-1 irrespective of expression of the α E integrin CD103, a T RM cell marker. In contrast, memory antiviral CD8 T cells in the spleen are PD-1 − , despite viral loads being similar in both the brain and spleen during persistent infection. Repetitive antigen engagement is central to sustained PD-1 expression by T cells in chronic viral infections; however, recent evidence indicates that expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1 is part of the T RM differentiation program. Here, we asked whether PD-1 expression by CD8 bT RM cells during persistent MuPyV encephalitis is antigen-dependent. By transferring MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM cells into brains of naive mice and mice infected with cognate epitope-sufficient and -deficient MuPyVs, we demonstrate that antigen and inflammation are dispensable for PD-1 maintenance. In vitro and direct ex vivo analyses indicate that CD103 − MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM retain functional competence. We further show that the Pdcd-1 promoter of anti-MuPyV bT RM cells is epigenetically fixed in a demethylated state in the brain. In contrast, the PD-1 promoter of splenic antiviral memory CD8 T cells undergoes remethylation after being demethylated during acute infection. These data show that PD-1 expression is an intrinsic property of brain T RM cells in a persistent CNS viral infection.","PD-1 expression has been proposed to constitute a facet of the T RM differentiation program to prevent inadvertent deployment of poised mRNAs for effector molecules. 1 In chronic LCMV infection, TCR signaling upregulates PD-1 expression at the effector stage of the splenic CD8 T cell response, with sustained PD-1 driving differentiation of exhausted T cells (T EX ) to prevent immunopathology. 2, 3 The state of PD-1 expression and its dependence on antigen by tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells during persistent viral infection remains to be defined. For example, CD8 bT RM cells from mice with acutely resolved vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encephalitis express PD-1 transcripts, but not PD-1 receptors, whereas bT RMs from mice persistently infected with mouse cytomegalovirus are PD-1 +. [4] [5] [6] This discrepancy in PD-1 expression by bT RM cells raised the question whether antigen and/or inflammation is involved in maintenance of PD-1 expression by bT RM cells during CNS infection. Tissue-intrinsic factors are also dominant determinants of the dependence on antigen for CD8 T RM cell generation and/or maintenance. Antigen is required for T RM cell formation and CD103 upregulation in the brain and dorsal root ganglion 5, 7, 8 but not in the skin, small intestine, female reproductive tract, and salivary glands 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . The role of antigen in maintenance of expression of PD-1 and CD103 by CD8 T RM cells in the brain remains to be determined."
The Global Polio Laboratory Network as a Platform for the Viral Vaccine-Preventable and Emerging Diseases Laboratory Networks HHS Public Access,"The Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) began building in the late 1980s on a 3-tiered structure of 146 laboratories with different and complementary technical and support capacities (poliovirus isolation, molecular strain characterization including sequencing, quality assurance, and research). The purpose of this network is to provide timely and accurate laboratory results to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Deeply integrated with field case-based surveillance, it ultimately provides molecular epidemiological data from polioviruses used to inform programmatic and immunization activities. This network of global coverage requires substantial investments in laboratory infrastructure, equipment, supplies, reagents, quality assurance, staffing and training, often in resource-limited settings. The GPLN has not only developed country capacities, but it also serves as a model to other global laboratory networks for vaccinepreventable diseases that will endure after the polio eradication goal is achieved. Leveraging lessons learned during past 27 years, the authors discuss options for transitioning GPLN assets to support control of other viral vaccine-preventable, emerging, and reemerging diseases.

Selected laboratories were enrolled into a collaborating network, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) coordinated by WHO. Network membership depended on nomination by host government, on-site evaluation by WHO of physical infrastructure, availability of suitably qualified personnel, and ability to accurately implement recommended procedures for poliovirus detection and characterization. Although not every country has a GPLN laboratory, each is linked to designated laboratories where specimens could be referred for rapid testing. After the initial decade of growth linked to introduction of regional eradication goals and corresponding surveillance programs, GPLN membership has been mostly constant; currently, 146 laboratories are enrolled and originally categorized into 3 groups ( Figure 1 ) with defined responsibilities: (1) subnational and national laboratories (n = 123), (2) regional reference laboratories (n = 17), and (3) global specialized laboratories (n = 6)."
Production of specific antibodies against SARS-coronavirus nucleocapsid protein without cross reactivity with human coronaviruses 229E and OC43,"Cross-reactivity of these anti-SARS Abs against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and HCoV OC43 were determined by Western blotting. The Abs produced reacted with recombinant SARS virus nucleocapsid protein, but not with HCoV 229E or HCoV OC43.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus nucleocapsid (N) protein is abundantly released in the patients' blood during early infection [6] , which suggested that the N protein is a suitable candidate for diagnostic applications. Detection of specific circulating Abs is potentially a highly sensitive and specific way to diagnose SARS. However, detection of SARS Abs from early-infected patients is difficult, because most patients experience IgG seroconversion on average 20 days after the onset of symptoms [5] . On the other hand, a highly conserved motif (FYYLGTGP: 111-118 a.a.), occurs in the N-terminal half of all coronavirus N proteins, and other conserved residues are reported to occur near this highly conserved motif [6] . The cross reactivity regions between SARS-coronavirus (CoV) and porcine CoVs were located in 120-208 a.a. of N protein [12] . Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV N protein and anti-human CoV (HCoV) 229E Abs or anti-HCov OC43 Abs has been reported [14] . It is therefore necessary to develop an assay that shows no cross-reactivity with other CoVs, especially HCoVs, to detect SARS proteins. Such a test could be used for early detection and follow-up of patients during treatment. In this study, we raised polyclonal and monoclonal Abs using a recombinant SARS N protein to develop a specific diagnostic test for SARS. The cDNA of SARS-CoV strain Hanoi provided by Dr. Kariwa of Hokkaido University was used as a template for PCR by Accupower premix (Bioneer, Korea). The full length of the SARS-CoV N gene was inserted into vector pET21a (Novagen, German). After transformation, E. coli strain Origami B (DE3) pLysS competent cells were induced using 1 mM IPTG (Invitrogen, USA) at 37 o C for 4 h. The expressed proteins were purified using the His-Bind kits (Novagen, German). Production of polyclonal and monoclonal Abs was performed as described by Shang et al. [7] . Human coronaviruses, HCoV 229E (ATCC, VR-730) and HCoV OC43 (ATCC, VR-1558), were infected to MRC-5 cells (Korean Cell Line Bank). Replication of these viruses was confirmed by RT-PCR of cell lysates infected with HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43. RT-PCR was performed as described in a previous study [10] . To examine whether Abs against recombinant N protein of the SARS virus react with other HCoVs, we performed Western blotting on recombinant SARS N protein or cell lysates infected with HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43. In our previous study, the antigenicity of recombinant of SARS-CoV N protein was checked with a mouse anti-SARS-CoV N protein monoclonal IgG2a (Zymed, USA), and convalescent SARS serum provided by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam [4] . We selected polyclonal and monoclonal Abs that showed the highest reactivity with the N protein in an ELISA. With these Abs, we determined cross-reactivity against cell lysates infected with HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 by Western blotting. The viruses in these cells lysates were confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 ). Abs reacted with recombinant N protein, but did not react with HCoVs in cell lysates (Fig. 2) . To determine the specificity of these Abs, cross reactivity with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (coronavirus group I) and mouse hepatitis virus (coronavirus group II) were analyzed by Western blotting but showed no reaction (data not shown)."

"Use of Revised International Health Regulations during Influenza A (H1N1) Epidemic, 2009","Strong international health agreements and good planning created a structure and common procedure for nations involved in detection and evaluation of the emergence of influenza A (H1N1). This report describes a timeline of events that led to the determination of the epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern, following the agreed-upon procedures of the International Health Regulations. These events illustrate the need for sound international health agreements and should be a call to action for all nations to implement these agreements to the best of their abilities.","strain of influenza A virus (H1N1) emerged in Mexico, the United States, and Canada. As of May 26, this contagious virus has spread to 46 countries, accounting for ≈13,000 cases. To date, >90 deaths caused by this virus have occurred, most of which have been in Mexico (1) . Suspected cases are even more widespread, and the number of cases will inevitably continue to increase and the virus will spread to more countries in the coming weeks and months."
Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses,"Arthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease 1 . The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized 2 . Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identified the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River, Mayaro, and O'nyong nyong (ONNV) viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced viral infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to CHIKV particles and enhanced virus attachment and Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.","internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked CHIKV infection in multiple cell types including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of CHIKV E2, a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of Mxr8a-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies reduced CHIKV or ONNV infection and associated foot swelling in mice. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses."

Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Bovine Respiratory Disease in Finland,"Härtel H, Nikunen S, Neuvonen E, Tanskanen R, Kivelä S-L, Aho P, Soveri T, Saloniemi H: Viral and bacterial pathogens in bovine respiratory disease in Finland. Acta vet. scand. 45, 193-200. -Pathogens causing bovine respiratory tract disease in Finland were investigated. Eighteen cattle herds with bovine respiratory disease were included. Five diseased calves from each farm were chosen for closer examination and tracheobronchial lavage. Blood samples were taken from the calves at the time of the investigation and from 86 calves 3-4 weeks later. In addition, 6-10 blood samples from animals of different ages were collected from each herd, resulting in 169 samples. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (PIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) and bovine adenovirus-7 (BAV-7). About one third of the samples were also tested for antibodies to bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) with negative results. Bacteria were cultured from lavage fluid and in vitro susceptibility to selected antimicrobials was tested. According to serological findings, PIV-3, BAV-7, BAV-3, BCV and BRSV are common pathogens in Finnish cattle with respiratory problems. A titre rise especially for BAV-7 and BAV-3, the dual growth of Mycoplasma dispar and Pasteurella multocida, were typical findings in diseased calves. Pasteurella sp. strains showed no resistance to tested antimicrobials. Mycoplasma bovis and Mannheimia haemolytica were not found. bovine respiratory disease; calf; pneumonia; bacteria; virus; mycoplasma; tracheobronchial lavage; seroconversion.","Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major health problem of cattle worldwide. It inflicts considerable financial losses in beef herds (Moreno-Lopez 1990 , Lekeaux 1995 and is the most common cause of mortality in dairy cattle (Wikse & Baker 1996) . It is also an important welfare problem of calves. The causation is multifactorial and the disease appears to be a result of the interaction of infectious micro-organisms and such predisposing factors as host defence, environment and stress (Roy 1990 , Wikse & Baker 1996 . Only a few reports exist on respiratory diseases of cattle in Finland (Sihvonen & Tuomi 1978 , Tanskanen 1987 , Rikula 2000 . In addition, limited field studies have been published from other Nordic countries (Elvander 1996 , Uttenthal et al. 1996 , Norström et al. 2000 , Larsen et al. 2001 ). Finland has a special situation, with freedom from certain aetiological agents. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR, BHV-1), for instance, does not exist in Finland. Moreover, My-coplasma bovis has not been detected in Finnish cattle, and bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) is very rare (Tanskanen 1987 , Anon. 2000 . Vaccines against respiratory disease are not used. Antimicrobials are generally not used for disease prevention and sick animals are mostly treated individually with antibiotics. However, the traditional farming system in Finland with small isolated cattle herds is changing. The dairy herds are enlarging gradually and calves of different ages are kept in group pens. In the new rearing system young calves at the age of 1-3 weeks originating from several dairy herds are transported to rearing units and reared in large groups. The aim of this study was to obtain basic knowledge of pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease in Finland and to evaluate the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in respiratory bacteria."
Cost-Benefit of Stockpiling Drugs for Influenza Pandemic,"We analyzed strategies for the use of stockpiled antiviral drugs in the context of a future influenza pandemic and estimated cost-benefit ratios. Current stockpiling of oseltamivir appears to be cost-saving to the economy under several treatment strategies, including therapeutic treatment of patients and postexposure prophylactic treatment of patients' close contacts.","T he widespread epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza that emerged in east Asia continues today. As the epidemic grows, so does the probability that this virulent virus will acquire genetic traits for increased personto-person transmissibility, potentially setting the stage for the next global influenza pandemic (1) ."
Preparation of an antitumor and antivirus agent: chemical modification of α-MMC and MAP30 from Momordica Charantia L. with covalent conjugation of polyethyelene glycol,"Background: Alpha-momorcharin (α-MMC) and momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) derived from Momordica charantia L. have been confirmed to possess antitumor and antivirus activities due to their RNA-N-glycosidase activity. However, strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit their clinical application. To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with (mPEG) 2 -Lys-NHS (20 kDa). Methodology/principal findings: In this article, a novel purification strategy for the two main type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), α-MMC and MAP30, was successfully developed for laboratory-scale preparation. Using this dramatic method, 200 mg of α-MMC and about 120 mg of MAP30 was obtained in only one purification process from 200 g of Momordica charantia seeds. The homogeneity and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE, electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as Western blot. Two polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated proteins were synthesized and purified. Homogeneous mono-, di-, or tri-PEGylated proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The analysis of antitumor and antivirus activities indicated that the serial PEGylated RIPs preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and herpes simplex virus-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%-70% antitumor and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased 50%-70% immunogenicity when compared with their unmodified counterparts. Conclusion/significance: α-MMC and MAP30 obtained from this novel purification strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for research. Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong immunogenicity and meanwhile preserve moderate activities. All these findings suggest the potential application of PEGylated α-MMC and PEGylated MAP30 as antitumor and antivirus agents. According to these results, PEGylated RIPs can be constructed with nanomaterials to be a targeting drug that can further decrease immunogenicity and side effects. Through nanotechnology we can make them low-release drugs, which can further prolong their half-life period in the human body.","Momordica charantia L. (MC), a Momordica Linn. genus of the family Cucurbitaceae and commonly known as bitter melon, is a traditional medicine plant indigenous to China. 1 The fruit and seed extracts from MC have been used in China for centuries for antivirus, antitumor, and immunopotentiating agent purposes. 2 In recent years, several ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), including momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) and α-momorcharin (MMC), β-MMC, and γ-MMC, a group of which belong to the family of single-chain RIPs, were found to have the ability to inhibit protein biosynthesis in tumor cells by catalytic inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. 3, 4 These proteins were also found to be able to inhibit the multiplication of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), 4, 5 poliovirus I in Hep2 cells, 6 and acquired human immunodeficiency virus type-l (HIV-l). 7 However, the strong immunogenicity, allergic reaction, and short half-life of these proteins have been considered the major barriers for their application as therapeutic agents in vivo. 8, 9 In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus to other technologies. An established technology, polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation (PEGylation), can bestow on proteins several benefits, such as increasing plasma half-life, decreasing toxicity, and reducing immunogenicity and antigenicity. 9, 10 The Food and Drug Administration has approved the PEGylated forms of the therapeutic proteins such as uricase, erythropoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon, adenosine deaminase, asparaginase, and a growth hormone antagonist. Another technology is nanotechnology, which uses nanomaterials for packing potential therapeutic proteins to extend the half-life period or to make them targeting drugs."
Nearest neighbor parameters for Watson-Crick complementary heteroduplexes formed between 2 0 -O-methyl RNA and RNA oligonucleotides,"Results from optical melting studies of Watson-Crick complementary heteroduplexes formed between 2 0 -O-methyl RNA and RNA oligonucleotides are used to determine nearest neighbor thermodynamic parameters for predicting the stabilities of such duplexes. The results are consistent with the physical model assumed by the individual nearest neighbor-hydrogen bonding model, which contains terms for helix initiation, base pair stacking and base pair composition. The sequence dependence is similar to that for Watson-Crick complementary RNA/RNA duplexes, which suggests that the sequence dependence may also be similar to that for other backbones that favor A-form RNA conformations.","Oligonucleotides are used for many applications, ranging from diagnostics (1) (2) (3) (4) to therapeutics (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) to nanotechnology (10, 11) . The thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex formation facilitates rational design of sequences for the various applications (12) (13) (14) . The thermodynamics of duplex formation is dependent on the backbone of the nucleic acid. For example, the sequence dependence of the thermodynamics of DNA/DNA (15, 16) , RNA/RNA (17, 18) and DNA/ RNA (19) duplexes differ. All, however, can be approximated well by nearest neighbor models when only Watson-Crick base pairs are formed. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the thermodynamics of Watson-Crick paired duplexes from sequence (16, (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Here, optical melting studies are analyzed to provide nearest neighbor thermodynamic parameters for formation of 2 0 -O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes that are Watson-Crick complementary. The 2 0 -O-methyl RNA and other 2 0 -O-alkyl backbones are particularly useful for hybridization to RNA because they favor A-form helical structure and are more resistant than RNA or DNA to nuclease digestion (23) (24) (25) (26) ."
Veillonella montpellierensis Endocarditis,"cause infections in humans. We report a case of Veillonella endocarditis documented by isolating a slow-growing, gram-negative microbe in blood cultures. This microbe was identified as the newly recognized species Veillonella montpellierensis (100% homology) by 16S RNA gene sequence analysis.","V eillonella are anaerobic, gram-negative cocci, part of the normal flora of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vaginal tract. Veillonella dispar, V. atypica, and V. parvula have been cultured from human specimens. They are infrequently isolated in human infections. Rarely, Veillonella species have been the only etiologic agents identified in serious infections such as meningitis, osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infection, pleuropulmonary infection, endocarditis, and bacteremia. A new species, V. montpellierensis, has recently been isolated from the gastric fluid of a newborn and from the amniotic fluid of 2 women (1). Its pathogenic role is still debated."
Machine learning approach identifies new pathways associated with demyelination in a viral model of multiple sclerosis Keywords: cholesterol • demyelination • immunohistology • microarray • multiple sclerosis • random forest machine learning algorithm • spinal cord • Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis • toll-like receptor 4,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major immune-mediated demyelinating human disease, affecting more than 2.5 million people [1] . It is characterized by varying amounts of demyelination, remyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal injury [1, 2] . In the majority of patients, the disease starts with a relapsing course (relapsing/remitting MS), followed by a progressive phase (secondary progressive MS) years later. In other patients, the relapsing form is missing and the disease is progressive right from the beginning (primary progressive MS). The mechanisms responsible for lesion induction and progression are complex and heterogeneous, and likely reflect different causes and immunopathogenetic mechanisms [3, 4]. A pathohistological comparison revealed that while focal, heavily inflamed, white matter plaques dominate in acute, relapsing MS, a more diffuse inflammatory process that affects the whole central nervous system is associated with massive cortical demyelination and diffuse axonal injury in progressive MS [5]. Based on these findings, Lassmann suggested that progression to progressive MS is associated with the development of a compartmentalized immune response, including intrathecal antibody production trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier [6, 7]. The currently available antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies which successfully reduce the severity and rate of relapses, however, frequently fail to prevent clinical and pathological deterioration of patients with progressive MS [6].","in a chronic progressive inflammatory demyelination of the spinal cord white matter, showing many clinical and pathohistological similarities to chronic progressive MS [8] [9] [10] . The recent demonstration of early onset axonal pathology in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis led to the conclusion, that Wallerian-type primary axonal pathology due to neuronal death in the acute polioencephalitic phase of the disease induces the first foci of inflammation and myelin breakdown in the spinal cord [11, 12] . Subsequently, a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction develops against the virus [13] , which triggers a cascade of events in which pro-inflammatory cytokines released from virus-specific CD4 ϩ T cells cause macrophage-induced bystander demyelination and release of endogenous myelin antigens [14] . Tissue damage and demyelination are exacerbated due to epitope spreading of CD4 ϩ T cells and delayed type hypersensitivity reaction against myelin epitopes [15] . It has been shown that macrophages are of special importance in the pathogenesis of demyelination in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis. They represent the main antigen presenting cells [16] , important effector cells of the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction [17] [18] [19] and the main reservoir for virus persistence [20] . Similarly in many chronic MS cases, remyelination is sparse or absent in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, despite the presence of intralesional oligodendroglial progenitor cells [10, 21] . In contrast to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, a fast and complete remyelination occurs in most other models of MS [22] [23] [24] [25] . Rodriguez suggested that the balance of de-and remyelination ultimately determines the outcome of an acute attack in MS and, possibly, the development of secondary progressive disease [3] . We recently reported that the failure of remyelination is due to an inhibited differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis [10] . Possible differentiation-inhibiting mechanisms include a non-permissive environment, axonal loss or the inability of chronically demyelinated axons to be remyelinated [26, 27] ."
A comparison of methods for purification and concentration of norovirus GII-4 capsid virus-like particles,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. NoV GII-4 VP1 protein was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system using Sf9 insect cells. Several methods for purification and concentration of virus-like particles (VLPs) were evaluated. Electron microscopy (EM) and histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding assays showed that repeated sucrose gradient purification followed by ultrafiltration resulted in intact VLPs with excellent binding to H type 3 antigens. VLPs were stable for at least 12 months at 4°C, and up to 7 days at ambient temperature. These findings indicate that this method yielded stable and high-quality VLPs.","Abstract Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide.

Current status of multiple antigen-presenting peptide vaccine systems: Application of organic and inorganic nanoparticles,"Many studies are currently investigating the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent various infectious diseases. Multiple antigen-presenting peptide vaccine systems have been developed to avoid the adverse effects associated with conventional vaccines (i.e., live-attenuated, killed or inactivated pathogens), carrier proteins and cytotoxic adjuvants. Recently, two main approaches have been used to develop multiple antigenpresenting peptide vaccine systems: (1) the addition of functional components, e.g., T-cell epitopes, cell-penetrating peptides, and lipophilic moieties; and (2) synthetic approaches using size-defined nanomaterials, e.g., selfassembling peptides, non-peptidic dendrimers, and gold nanoparticles, as antigen-displaying platforms. This review summarizes the recent experimental studies directed to the development of multiple antigen-presenting peptide vaccine systems.","From the latter half of the 18 th century onwards, vaccinations have saved millions of human lives and countless animals, and vaccinology contributes to the prevention of infectious diseases (e.g., polio, measles, and rubella) and antiserums for toxoids (e.g., snake bites, spider bites and jellyfish stings). However, there is a strong demand for the development of safer and more effective vaccines toward not only the prevention of many infectious diseases, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1] [2] [3] , malaria [4] [5] [6] , group A streptococci (GAS) [7, 8] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [9, 10] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11, 12] , but also for cancer immunotherapy [13] [14] [15] . Synthetic immunogenic peptides are ideal vaccine subunit components because of the following differences to traditional vaccines composed of live-attenuated, killed or inactivated pathogens e.g., bacteria or viruses: (1) no infectious material; (2) no cross-reactivity with host tissues; (3) induction of sitespecific antibodies (Abs); (4) ability to chemically define and modify products; and (5) swift large-scale manufacturing and long-term storage in the event of a pandemic. However, the biological activity of peptides is generally short due to enzymatic degradation, and small peptides that are used as antigens are not recognized by immune cells, e.g., dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and do not elicit a strong immune response when administered alone. The co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, liposomes, bacterial lipophilic compounds, etc.) with subunit peptide antigens is one of the methods used to enhance the immune response; however, only a few adjuvants are approved for clinical use [16] . Alternatively, short antigenic peptides induce strong immune responses when co-administrated or engaged with carrier proteins (e.g., ovalbumin (OVA), bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, tetanus toxoid, etc.); however, they are also associated with undesirable effects such as the suppression of the antipeptide Ab response and the production of Abs against the carrier proteins [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ."
Moderate mutation rate in the SARS coronavirus genome and its implications,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused a severe global epidemic in 2003 which led to hundreds of deaths and many thousands of hospitalizations. The virus causing SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and multiple genomic sequences have been revealed since mid-April, 2003. After a quiet summer and fall in 2003, the newly emerged SARS cases in Asia, particularly the latest cases in China, are reinforcing a wide-spread belief that the SARS epidemic would strike back. With the understanding that SARS-CoV might be with humans for years to come, knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the SARS-CoV, including its mutation rate and emergence time, is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen. To date, the speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the elapsed time before it was transmitted to humans remains poorly understood.","The earliest confirmed case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in November, 2002 in the Guangdong province of China. Toward the end of the epidemic (as reported by July 31, 2003) there were 8,098 recognized cases in 31 countries or regions worldwide and 774 implicated deaths (WHO, http://www.who.int/csr/ sars/country/table2003_09_23/en/). Due to an unprecedented international effort, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causal agent in late March 2003 and its first complete genomic sequences were published April 13, 2003 [1, 2] . One month later, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in palm civets and other animals in Guangdong, China, the first evidence of possible interspecies transmission of the virus [3] . The re-emergence of the isolated SARS cases in Asia in December, 2003 and in Anhui province and Beijing, China, in late April 2004, has confirmed a wide-spread conjecture that the SARS-CoV will likely be with humans for years to come. This reemergence of SARS cases makes it legitimate to critically re-evaluate the time for the origin of the SARS-CoV."

SARS-CoV Infection in a Restaurant from Palm Civet SARS-CoV Infection in a Restaurant from Palm Civet Emerging Infectious Diseases • www Past Issues on SARS,"Epidemiologic investigations showed that 2 of 4 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) identified in the winter of 2003-2004 were a waitress at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, that served palm civets as food and a customer who ate in the restaurant a short distance from animal cages. All 6 palm civets at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Partial spike (S) gene sequences of SARS-CoV from the 2 patients were identical to 4 of 5 S gene viral sequences from palm civets. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV from palm civets in the restaurant was most closely related to animal isolates. SARS cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir, and not the result of continued circulation of SARS-CoV in the human population.","T he severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic emerged in 2003 in 6 municipalities in the Pearl River delta region in Guangdong, China. Early casepatients were more likely to be persons with occupational exposure to animals, such as animal sellers or restaurant cooks (1, 2) . Tracing the source of infection has been complicated, given the sporadic nature of index cases without a clear history of contact with animals. After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the SARS epidemic, 4 new cases of SARS were reported from December 16, 2003, to January 1, 2004 , in Guangzhou in Guangdong Province. These cases were not linked to any laboratory accidents. All patients had a temperature >38°C, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and serologic evidence of SARS infection. Fever lasted from 6 to 18 days (median 7), no mechanical ventilation was required, and the clinical course of the disease ranged from 21 to 24 days with full recovery. All 4 patients had communityacquired infections without any apparent epidemiologic link. A total of 257 contacts, including 113 close contacts, of these patients were observed for 2 weeks, with no secondary transmission identified. These patients had mild symptoms and no secondary transmission, which was remarkably different from patients in the 2003 epidemic."
Identification of Hepta-and Octo-Uridine stretches as sole signals for programmed +1 and À1 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of SARS-CoV ORF 3a variants,"Programmed frameshifting is one of the translational recoding mechanisms that read the genetic code in alternative ways. This process is generally programmed by signals at defined locations in a specific mRNA. In this study, we report the identification of hepta-and octo-uridine stretches as sole signals for programmed +1 and À1 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF 3a variants. SARS-CoV ORF 3a encodes a minor structural protein of 274 amino acids. Over the course of cloning and expression of the gene, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. In vitro and in vivo expression of clones with six, seven and eight Ts, respectively, showed the detection of the full-length 3a protein. Mutagenesis studies led to the identification of the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches as slippery sequences for efficient frameshifting. Interestingly, no stimulatory elements were found in the sequences upstream or downstream of the slippage site. When the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches were used to replace the original slippery sequence of the SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b, efficient frameshift events were observed. Furthermore, the efficiencies of frameshifting mediated by the hepta-and octouridine stretches were not affected by mutations introduced into a downstream stem-loop structure that totally abolish the frameshift event mediated by the original slippery sequence of ORF 1a and 1b. Taken together, this study identifies the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches that function as sole elements for efficient +1 and À1 ribosomal frameshift events.","In all organisms, accurate transfer of genetic information is critical for maintaining their genetic traits. During translation, universal decoding rules would be prevailing and guarantee correct decoding of the genetic code. However, cells do evolve various translational recoding mechanisms to interpret the genetic code in alternative ways. Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is one of these recoding mechanisms. This mechanistically diverse process is well characterized in retrotransposons (1,2), bacteria (3) (4) (5) , insects (6) , animals (7) and animal viruses (8) (9) (10) (11) . Generally, the ribosome can shift its frame during translation elongation either in the forward (3 0 ) or backward (5 0 ) direction, causing +1 or À1 frameshifting. A À1 frameshift event takes place in most cases, such as the gag-pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (12) , the 1a/ 1b gene of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (9) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (8, 13) . Examples of +1 frameshifting include GAG3 and POL3 (GAG3-POL3) genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast (2) , the mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (7) and the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (14) ."

Examining the relationship between household air pollution and infant microbial nasal carriage in a Ghanaian cohort HHS Public Access,"Background: Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS).","Approximately 3 billion people worldwide use biomass fuels for their cooking and heating needs, including wood, dung, charcoal, and crop residues (Bonjour et al., 2013) . The combustion of these fuels produces a complex mixture of air pollutants collectively termed household air pollution (HAP). These air pollutants contributed to 59 million disabilityadjusted life years and 1.6 million premature deaths worldwide in 2017 (IMHE, 2017) . Of the diseases HAP contributes to, pneumonia has the largest impact on children (Gordon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014) . Pneumonia is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide for children under five years of age (Stanaway et al., 2018) , and almost half of that mortality is in Sub-Saharan Africa (Troeger et al., 2017) .

An unusually high proportion of severe cases and a high case-fatality rate have been observed for patients infected with this virus (2) ."
Pandemic Infl uenza and Excess Intensive-Care Workload,"In the Netherlands a major part of preparedness planning for an epidemic or pandemic consists of maintaining essential public services, e.g., by the police, fi re departments, army personnel, and healthcare workers. We provide estimates for peak demand for healthcare workers, factoring in healthcare worker absenteeism and using estimates from published epidemiologic models on the expected evolution of pandemic infl uenza in relation to the impact on peak surge capacity of healthcare facilities and intensive care units (ICUs). Using various published scenarios, we estimate their effect in increasing the availability of healthcare workers for duty during a pandemic. We show that even during the peak of the pandemic, all patients requiring hospital and ICU admission can be served, including those who have non-infl uenza-related conditions. For this rigorous task differentiation, clear hierarchical management, unambiguous communication, and discipline are essential and we recommend informing and training non-ICU healthcare workers for duties in the ICU.

Oral Vaccination with the Porcine Rotavirus VP4 Outer Capsid Protein Expressed by Lactococcus lactis Induces Specific Antibody Production,"The objective of this study to design a delivery system resistant to the gastrointestinal environment for oral vaccine against porcine rotavirus. Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 was transformed with segments of vP4 of the porcine rotavirus inserted into the pNZ8112 surface-expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis expressing VP4 protein was constructed. An approximately 27 kDa VP4 protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and immunostaining analysis. BALB/c mice were immunized orally with VP4-expression recombinant L. lactis and cellular, mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses were examined. Specific anti-VP4 secretory IgA and IgG were found in feces, ophthalmic and vaginal washes and in serum. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on porcine rotavirus infection on MA104 cells. Our findings suggest that oral immunization with VP4-expressing L. lactis induced both specific local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.","Rotavirus is an important pathogen that causes diarrhea in human infants and in animals worldwide [1] .

Dendritic Cell-Specific Antigen Delivery by Coronavirus Vaccine Vectors Induces Long-Lasting Protective Antiviral and Antitumor Immunity,"Efficient vaccination against infectious agents and tumors depends on specific antigen targeting to dendritic cells (DCs). We report here that biosafe coronavirus-based vaccine vectors facilitate delivery of multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to professional antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Vaccine vectors based on heavily attenuated murine coronavirus genomes were generated to express epitopes from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein, or human Melan-A, in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-","strategies (14) (15) (16) . These protein-based vaccines generate CD4 ϩ T cell and B cell responses against a range of different antigens. However, antigen coupling to antibodies is a major limitation for the induction of CD8 ϩ T cell responses which are strictly dependent on cross-presentation (5, 17) . In contrast, viral vectors encoding immunogenic antigens can deliver their genetic cargo directly into DCs, thus generating antigenic peptides in infected cells and allowing for efficient loading of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Among the currently most exploited virus systems that facilitate antigen delivery to DCs are adenoviral (18, 19) , lentiviral (20) , arenaviral (21) , and alphaviral (22, 23) systems. However, major impediments of these vectors are frequent off-target transduction, resulting in antigen presentation by parenchymal cells outside secondary lymphoid organs, and limited cloning capacity for the insertion of multiple or large antigens. For example, the strong tropism of adenoviral vectors for hepatocytes, with Ͼ95% of the genetic material being deposited in the liver, leads to generation of functionally impaired CD8 ϩ T cells (24, 25) . Major efforts are thus required to engineer adenoviral vectors with improved specificity for the relevant antigenpresenting cells (12, 19) . Likewise, lentiviral vectors preferentially infect cells other than DCs, and redirection of their target cell tropism is warranted (26) . An additional potential imped- iment for the use of DNA-based viral vectors in clinics is their potential to integrate genomic material into the host genome (27) ."
,"Nosocomial infections are a major worldwide cause of death and disability, infection control programs are effective in limiting these infections, especially those acquired in the intensive care unit. The development of the world wide web has provided health care professionals with immediate access to continuously updated information in the field of infection control. We sought to identify websites that contain information on nosocomial infection control by using popular internet search engines, such as Google, Yahoo and AltaVista, and by reviewing relevant publications identified in the PubMed and Current Contents databases. Only those sites that were English language, open access, and developed by a government, academic institution, or national or international scientific association were eligible for inclusion. From a vast number of internet sites initially identified, we selected 49 that provide information on infection control for inclusion in our list of practical and relevant internet resources. Several sites provide general information on infection control practices, whereas others focus on one or a few specific infection(s). We provide health care professionals with a timely and succinct list of open access internet resources that contain information regarding the prevention and control of nosocomial infections in order to help in the dissemination of relevant information and so contribute to the limitation of such hazards.

Possible SARS Coronavirus Transmission during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation,"Infection of healthcare workers with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission. However, infrequent healthcare worker infections occurred despite the use of contact and droplet precautions, particularly during certain aerosolgenerating medical procedures. We investigated a possible cluster of SARS-CoV infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a SARS patient. Unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty. However, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of SARS-CoV. On the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality control.","D uring the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1-5), a great deal was discovered about the illness and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (6, 7) . SARS-CoV infection is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission (3, 8) . However, despite the use of infection control precautions and personal protective equipment designed to prevent contact and droplet transmission, episodes of SARS-CoV transmission to health-care workers have continued to occur under certain circumstances."
Real time reverse transcription (RRT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus and European swine influenza A virus infections in pigs,Background There is a requirement to detect and differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1v) and established swine influenza A viruses (SIVs) by real time reverse transcription (RRT) PCR methods.,"The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1v) emerged in April 2009 and was first detected in a cluster of human respiratory cases in Mexico and the USA; initially, the virus could not be subtyped using available molecular tests. [1] [2] [3] Genetic and antigenic characterisation of the H1N1v virus showed it to be distinct from current seasonal H1N1 influenza A viruses circulating in humans. 4, 5 Rapid spread of H1N1v to other continents and frequent escalating human transmission resulted in an official declaration of a new human influenza A pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 June 2009. 6, 7 Regardless of their host of origin, influenza A viruses usually have the potential to infect and, during dual infections, re-assort in other host species. Pigs are particularly susceptible to infections from other hosts because receptors for influenza A viruses of both human and avian origin are present in their upper respiratory tract. 8, 9 Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) circulating in pig herds include H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes and these have been observed globally. [10] [11] [12] [13] H1N1 SIVs were first isolated in the 1930s, and phylogenetic studies have shown that these ''classical swine'' isolates were originally closely related to the human H1N1 ''Spanish 'flu''' pandemic influenza virus of 1918, but subsequently these classical H1N1 SIVs evolved into a unique genetic lineage. 11 H3N2 SIVs have also evolved distinctly in pigs following the human ''Asian 'flu''' pandemic of 1968. During the early 1990s, ''avian-like'' H1N1 SIVs became common in European farmed pigs and have replaced classical swine H1N1. 10, 11 However, classical swine H1N1 remained present in the USA and many parts of Asia. [10] [11] [12] [13] Evolution of SIVs in North America has included emergence of a triple re-assortment H3N2 in 1998 that contained genes of human, avian, and classical H1N1 swine influenza origin genes. 12, 13 These triple reassortant viruses have become endemic in North America, and, through additional reassortment events, triple reassortant variants of the H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes have been detected. 5, 12, 13 In the case of H1N2 SIVs isolated in Europe, the H1 gene is of human H1 seasonal influenza origin. 11, 14 The first instance of infection of pigs with H1N1v was reported in May 2009 in Canada where it was suspected that pigs were infected through contact with infected humans. 15, 16 SIVs are known to infect humans 17, 18 and poultry, [19] [20] [21] [22] while human influenza A viruses are also known to transmit to pigs. 23 Continuing human cases of H1N1v during 2009 sustained veterinary concerns that this virus may become established in pigs, with a degree of concern that this host may then serve as a source for further influenza A reassortment and future zoonotic transmission. 24 Although swine influenza is not listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 25, 26 SIV surveillance programmes have been carried out in Europe and North America and have provided valuable epidemiological information. [10] [11] [12] [13] These surveillance programmes have been based on conventional testing as recommended by the OIE, 27 using attempted virus isolation (VI) in cell culture and embryonated fowls' eggs (EFEs), followed by typing with defined antisera to identify the haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtypes using well-established haemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition tests (HI and NI), respectively. 27 In recent years, highly sensitive and specific real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT PCR) technology has been exploited by veterinary institutes and reference laboratories to develop and validate appropriate tests for avian influenza viruses (AIVs). 28 These include validated RRT PCR tests for notifiable AI caused by H5 and H7 subtype viruses, following concerns resulting from the spread of H5N1 highly pathogenic (HP) AI in poultry in the Eastern Hemisphere, together with a number of accompanying zoonotic cases. Many veterinary laboratories have already embraced generic AI RRT PCRs that detect all six-teen H subtypes of influenza A, typically through amplifying within the highly conserved M gene, and also as specific assays for AIVs of H5 and H7 subtypes. 28 While public health institutions have recently described RRT PCRs for the detection of H1N1v in the context of the current human pandemic, [29] [30] [31] [32] in this study, we describe and validate similar approaches for the detection of H1N1v in pigs. Full genome sequence analysis of the current H1N1v reveals the virus to be putatively of swine origin. 4, 5 Segment 7, which includes the matrix (M) gene that encodes the matrix M1 and M2 proteins, appears to be of Eurasian SIV origin, while segment 4, which encodes the H1 haemagglutinin (HA), is related to American classical SIV H1 genes. 4, 5 This study outlines the adaptation of an existing M gene RRT PCR assay for the generic detection of SIVs and H1N1v, plus a novel RRT PCR that amplifies within the H1 gene for the specific detection of H1N1v in European pigs."
Extraction and characterization of the rhesus macaque T cell receptor β-chain genes,"Rhesus macaque models have been instrumental for the development and testing of vaccines prior to human studies and have provided fundamental insights into the determinants of immune efficacy in a variety of infectious diseases. However, the characterization of antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires during adaptive immune responses in these models has previously relied on human TCR gene assignments. Here, we extracted and characterized TCR β-chain (TRB) genes from the recently sequenced rhesus macaque genome that are homologous to the human TRB genes. Comparison of the rhesus macaque TRB genes with the human TRB genes revealed an average best-match similarity of 92.9%. Furthermore, we confirmed the usage of most rhesus macaque TRB genes by expressed TCRβ sequences within epitope-specific TCR repertoires. This primary description of the rhesus macaque TRB genes will provide a standardized nomenclature and enable better characterization of TCR usage in studies that utilize this species.","The rhesus macaque is widely used as a non-human primate model to study infection and immunity due to the close genetic relationship with humans (∼93% average humanmacaque sequence identity1) and the homology between human and rhesus pathogen genomes2, 3.

The great opportunity: Evolutionary applications to medicine and public health,"Of evolutionary biology's many practical applications, those in medicine are the most obvious and potentially the most important. So far, however, medicine, nursing and public health have made use of only a fraction of what evolution has to offer. The magnitude of the gap is impressive. Studies of medical education found that most medical schools in the UK and the USA have not one evolutionary biologist on the faculty (Nesse and Schiffman","2003; Harris and Malyango 2005) . Many medical students do not even accept the theory of evolution (Downie 2004) . Most medical students get two or more years of basic science education, including embryology, biochemistry, anatomy, histology, and physiology, and many get a genetics course from a professor who knows evolutionary biology. However, we know of no medical school that teaches a course in evolutionary biology as a basic medical science, and none that requires evolution as a prerequisite. Our teaching experience confirms that few doctors have a chance to learn the principles of evolutionary biology most useful for medicine."

Pandemic influenza: are we prepared to face our obligations?,"After decades of low personal risk for contracting lethal diseases, physicians are suddenly facing the possibility of a substantial increase in occupational risk during an influenza pandemic. If they are not confronted before the onset of an influenza pandemic, feelings of unease and fear or ignorance about physicians' professional obligations could profoundly hinder individual physicians in fulfilling their professional duties. Such feelings could therefore undermine institutional and societal preparations.

Biological targets for isatin and its analogues: Implications for therapy,"Isatin and its metabolites are constituents of many natural substances. They are also components of many synthetic compounds exhibiting a wide range of effects, including antiviral activity, antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, antibacterial, antitubercular, antifungal, antiaptotic, anticonvulsant and anxyolytic activities. Isatin itself is an endogenous oxidized indole with a wide spectrum of behavioral and metabolic effects. It has a distinct and discontinuous distribution in the brain, peripheral tissues and body fl uids and isatin binding sites are widely distributed also. Its output is increased during stress. Its most potent known in vitro actions are as an antagonist of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) function and NO signaling. As we understand more about its function and sites of action we may be able to develop new pharmacological agents to mimic or counteract its activity. We consider here the most promising biological targets for various isatin analogues and/or metabolites, which are employed for the development of various groups of therapeutics. It is also possible that the level of endogenous isatin may infl uence the in vivo pharmacological activity of compounds possessing the isatin moiety.","Endogenous compounds are often used as a basis, or structural component, of pharmacological preparations. For example indirubin is the active ingredient of Danggui Longhui Wan, a mixture of plants that is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat chronic diseases (Hoessel et al 1999) and also individual Chinese medicinal herbs Isatis indigotica and Strobilanthes cusia (Mak et al 2004) . Indirubin derivatives are potent inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases and some other pharmacologically important kinases. Indirubin may be formed during dimerization of isatin (Figure 1 ), another biologically active compound, which attracts much interest of pharmacologists. Isatin (indoledione 2, 3) is an endogenous indole found in the mammalian brain, peripheral tissues and body fl uids (see for review Medvedev et al 1996; Glover et al 1998; Medvedev and Glover 2004; Medvedev, Igosheva et al 2005) . The isatin moiety is also present in a range of compounds which can act as inhibitors of apoptosis Chapman et al 2002) , anticonvulsants (Verma et al 2004) , and other antiviral (Sriram et al 2004; Pirrung et al 2005) , anti-bacterial and anti-fungal (Chohan et al 2004) agents. It is possible that drugs containing the isatin moiety, may compete with endogenous isatin, and the latter can infl uence their therapeutic effect. Consequently, analysis of the isatin content of the body, its metabolic routes, and its interactions may not only be of importance for understanding more about the function of this endogenous regulator, but also for understanding its possible role as a functional agonist/antagonist of drugs."

Transmission parameters of the A ⁄ H1N1 (2009) influenza virus pandemic: a review,"Background The new influenza virus A ⁄ H1N1 (2009), identified in mid-2009, rapidly spread over the world. Estimating the transmissibility of this new virus was a public health priority. Methods We reviewed all studies presenting estimates of the serial interval or generation time and the reproduction number of the A ⁄ H1N1 (2009) virus infection.","In April 2009, a new influenza virus A ⁄ H1N1 (2009) was isolated in Mexico and has rapidly spread over the world, being reported in 214 countries 1 year after its first identification. 1 The spread of the virus was extremely fast worldwide. 2 As soon as the new virus was identified, a major issue was to estimate the transmissibility of the new virus. In the guidance document 'Global surveillance during an influenza pandemic' released by the World Health Organization, three parameters were highlighted that should be documented quickly in this respect: the incubation period (time between infection and symptoms), the serial interval (time between symptoms onset in primary case and secondary case), and the reproduction ratio ⁄ number (average number of secondary cases per primary case). 3 These parameters are instrumental to assessing the feasibility and efficacy of intervention strategies against pandemic influenza. 4 Information regarding the serial interval and the reproduction number from past pandemics has been limited. For the serial interval, the best information concerned sea-sonal influenza infections 5, 6 and no information was available regarding past pandemics. There was comparatively more information regarding reproduction numbers, with estimates obtained in the last four pandemics (1889, 1918, 1957, 1968) . [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Estimates have ranged between 1 and 6 depending not only on place, time, wave, but also on the methods and assumptions used in estimation."

After 3-day-old goslings were orally inoculated with a NGVEV-CN strain suspension, the time course of NGVEV effects on apoptotic morphological changes of the internal tissues was evaluated. These changes were observed by histological analysis with light microscopy and ultrastructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy. DNA fragmentation was assessed with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA ladder analysis. A series of characteristic apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies were noted. Apoptosis was readily observed in the lymphoid and gastrointestinal organs, and sporadically occurred in other organs after 3 days post-infection (PI). The presence and quantity of TUNEL-positive cells increased with infection time until 9 days PI. DNA extracted from the NGVEVinfected gosling cells displayed characteristic 180∼200 bp ladders. Apoptotic cells were ubiquitously distributed, especially among lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial and intestinal cells. Necrosis was subsequently detected during the late NGVEV-infection phase, which was characterized by cell swelling, plasma membrane collapse, and rapidly lysis. Our results suggested that apoptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NGVE disease.","Apoptosis, a cell suicide mechanism that helps eliminate redundant, damaged, or infected cells, was first observed in metazoan organisms by Kerr et al. [25] . Apoptosis is a physiological process characterized by a number of distinct morphological features and biochemical processes [16, 41, 42] , including cell shrinkage and partial detachment from the substratum, plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and intra-nucleosomal cleavage [28] . This form of physiological cell death is morphologically distinct from necrosis, in which the cell swells and disintegrates in a disorderly manner and eventually results in the destruction of the cellular organelles, rupture of the plasma membrane, and leakage of the cell content [39] . Apoptosis is recognized as an important process in different biological systems including embryonic development, cell turnover, and immune response against tumorigenic or virus-infected cells [21, 29, 37 ]. An increasing number of viruses or viral gene products have been reported to induce apoptosis [17, 22, 26, 30] . New type gosling viral enteritis (NGVE) is an infectious disease that affects goslings less than 30 days of age, and is caused by an adenovirus called the NGVE virus (NGVEV) [4, 5, 12, 13, 15, 27, 40] . In gosling-producing areas, NGVE has resulted in significant economic losses due to the high mortality of the offspring of breeder geese [12, 27] . This disease is clinically characterized by digestive, respiratory, and neurological symptoms along with sudden death [14, 15] . Catarrhal haemorrhagic fibrinonecrotic enteritis in the small intestine and intestinal obstruction of the middle-lower portion of the intestine are typical pathological changes observed in NGVEV-infected goslings [15] . Previous immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemical staining studies indicated that the principal sites of NGVEV antigen localization are the digestive organs and lymphoid organs [9, 10] . Furthermore, other studies showed that apoptosis can be induced by NGVEV in 334 Shun Chen et al. monolayer primary duck embryo fibroblasts and the host cells of duck embryos [5] [6] [7] [8] . According to our recent research results, NGVEV can induce apoptosis in infected gosling; however, detailed information about this process is still unavailable [11] . To investigate apoptosis evoked by NGVEV infection in vivo, apoptotic morphological changes were observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA fragmentation was also monitored with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA ladder analysis."
